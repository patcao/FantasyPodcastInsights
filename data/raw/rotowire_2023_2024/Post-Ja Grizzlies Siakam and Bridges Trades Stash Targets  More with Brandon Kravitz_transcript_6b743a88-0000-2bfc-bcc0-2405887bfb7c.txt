welcome to a Wednesday morning edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball pod Nick Whalen Brandon Kravitz here with you as we are every Wednesday morning Brandon it's been a bit of hectic couple weeks around the holidays good to be back on a normal schedule I know you and I both been sick over the last couple of months I went through you know a multi-week airpod saga as you can see airpods are back looking good I ordered a new replacement airpod to replace the one that was lost that was a whole a whole thing you know it turns out they have to like sit in the case for like a full day to pair and like get the same firmware so went through that battle finally got it working and then I'm also moving this week so we're like you know getting everything out of our house I'm sitting in an empty room which you can't really see based on how I have the camera position but we're moving things around and then the other airpod turns up now I have three airpods wow well hey if you grow that third year you're gonna be all set ready to go yeah right I don't know if there's a way I can like maybe stuff two of them and get like double sound and one year but we're back on track yeah please get the that the questions rolling we will take live listener live viewer questions over the second half of the Pod so throw those in the chat we are not ignoring them we will hit on as many as we can if not all of them later in the podcast so again feel free to start stacking those up  Brandon we we had a pretty pretty mild slate in the NBA last night we had a few blowouts Sacramento Detroit is funny because Kings win that game 131 110 I was on NBA Radio last night and my my best bet was Detroit team total under 1:13 and a half which somehow ended up hitting I really wrote this one off the Pistons put a 47 points in the first quarter they were leading this game by 20 Midway through the second quarter and ended up losing by 21 yeah 15.4 quarter for the Pistons I think like you said they were up by 20 at one point and then wound up losing by 20 that's almost hard to pull that off even for a bad team like the Pistons but this is their issue it's it's weird to say this about a team that only has three wins I actually don't think the Pistons are that bad I think that they're they're things that I see about this team that I like there's just there's a scrappy nature about them they've got some Talent on this roster they cannot put things together for four full quarters that's their problem so perhaps they need to retool things certainly not saying that the they got their roster for the future but there are some pieces that I think you could keep for this version of the rebuild and and maybe it comes down to a coaching issue but I like I think the Pistons moving forward or team that you can bet on here and there but you also have to strap  in and get ready for games like you saw last night yeah I I felt like a complete idiot you know Alex and I talked through that game we're like why is this line only 11 this is insane you know Hammer the Kings tonight and I'm like man we're gonna get Tweets we're gonna look like we know nothing about the MBA and thankfully the Detroit Pistons showed up and are the Detroit Pistons you are right from a betting perspective it hasn't been maybe quite as disastrous as you would think I mean they are 14 22 and one ATS obviously that's not good that's 28th in the NBA but you know with the amount it feels like they're getting blown out by 20 plus every night right and that's not necessarily the case like they are they're starting to cover a little bit more of late I mean they're better against the Phoenix Atlanta is an NBA worst 8 in 27 against the number  yeah like yeah and and I think there's gonna be opportunities moving forward because these breads are only going to get bigger especially with Cade Cunningham out of the lineup and water tends to find its level only sharp Bettors are going to be on the Pistons and this should tell you everything that you need to know it's a team that you do you want to bet them every night no you don't need that kind of stress in your life but I do think that it's a team that I wouldn't just outright ignore them night tonight if you like betting the NBA and you look at the Slate you know when you get the Pistons that double digits last night it didn't work out thankfully I didn't I didn't take the dive there last night but I do think that in certain spots the the Pistons might be trustable  won the Pistons aren't that bad to sharps are betting the Pistons those are those are two money quotes excuse me Brandon well we'll have to clip those for the RotoWire Twitter account I mean the nice thing like what Detroit keeps it well relatively in reason or you know when they put up 47 in the first quarter it's like they're a gold mine for the team that's playing against that right I mean this is like the ideal scenario of like if you rolled to baptist a bonus out there in DFS last night you're just like crossing your fingers like please play 30 minutes and this was a competitive enough game that he played 38 he goes 16 of 20 one from the field 3713 and 10 Keegan Murray had a nice night as well right after I dropped him in a shallow League to pick up go to say he goes for 32 points at five three-pointers with two blocks I actually did have the had the over on five and a half assists for dear and fox which ended up sinking one of my Underdog entries last night and had that Tethered to Jayden Ivy over two and a half turnovers what not recommend betting turnovers in general but  when is the Pistons what is Jade Ivy it was actually a really fun sweat he picked up two turnovers over the course of a minute the one that pushed it over was a charge that was reviewed I mean there is nothing more thrilling than waiting out a review hoping that a charge is called that's great yeah that's a charge that's a shard  it's definitely one of those bets that it's got to be it's got to be an underdog play where you're slamming some together you can't just solo bet turnovers sit there watching NBA game that's just you're not getting your money's worth on league pass if that's the way you're consuming this sport but that's the issue and you talk about deer and fox and him falling short of the total on his assists I hate when I bet a prop and a game turns into a blowout because it's it seems like that's when you know I'm not even I don't even feel hopeful that that I'm gonna get there by the end of the game because I'm just sitting there on pins and needles waiting for the head coach to take the guy out of the lineup entirely so that's a that can be a frustrating watch I dealt with that last night the magic were swiftly taking care of by the Minnesota Timberwolves but if you're on any magic props so you at least got a decent sweat out of it because  they didn't have a rotation so it's not like they like Jamal Mosley couldn't go to this bench group that it didn't exist you know they only had like nine guys active last night I want to talk about the Magic in a moment but I do want to close out Detroit and just kind of give a look at all right here's what the rotation could be over the next week or so with Kate Cunningham out and you know the timeline is 7 to 10 days  could you know could be seven days could end up being two or three weeks you never really know obviously Detroit you know sitting at three and thirty four on the season they're in no position to rush gate cutting hand back but we saw Jade and Ivy you know he's continuing to start he played 33 minutes last night look decent outside of the four turnovers 22 652 steals Killian Hayes moved into the starting lineup I wish I would have been his turnover prop he had five turnovers I think in the first half finished was six that's kind of who killed he and his is you can if you're in a deeper league and you really need assistance and maybe if you steals here and there you could grab him but you know four points on four shots and 31 minutes in a game where the Pistons actually played pretty well for half of it that's kind of what you're looking at with with Killian Hayes you know I I wondered if in a roundabout way you know the cuttingham absence that's like you know 38 minutes a night that are up for grabs if that would lead to a little bit more a star Thompson last night it did not 14 minutes for us are didn't pick up three fouls did have three steals in 14 minutes but not necessarily looking like he's going to be a big-time beneficiary we did see a little more Marcus Sasser Off the Bench but not a whole lot there for fantasy  sorry Thompson you talk about a guy that has hit a rookie wall horde and fast he is giving you a whole lot of nothing recently and was a guy that we talked about weeks ago it's heavy in the trade market somebody that we wanted to Target or even sell high on and we're talking about some big names that you could you could package together and try and get for an assault Thompson package now now I see him out there on the waiver wire I'm not even interested but I do think this Kate Cunningham injury while it's unfortunate because I love watching him play and he's been putting up incredible numbers it does open up some opportunities Jaden Ivy is somebody I know we've gotten a lot of questions about I'm I like his talent and I think with the usage wise you're gonna be with with what the kind of workload he's going to have I think this could be an opportunity for him to Blossom points in assists for sure and as long as that percentage stays up and Jayden ivy  could be a guy that helps you for the next couple of weeks yeah absolutely all right before we talk Orlando Magic we got a message from our

house last night for this beat down I was front and center I was not pretty it was and it was it happened fast too it was 11 nothing right out of the gate and you could tell the magic had nothing left and really we shouldn't be surprised this is a team that and I don't mean this from the totality of the season but definitely within the last week I've been playing way over their heads they're shooting percentage prior to last night they're three-point shooting percentage over a stretch of four games was like 46% they'd been making 18 threes per game that's eight more than their average on the season so they've been getting by and almost like a college basketball kind of away when you see these teams in the tournament or you go you don't have the bodies to compete with the Blue Bloods but they just get red hot from three that was the magic against the Nuggets Last Friday Night  against the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday night at the Kia Center I'm still getting used to saying that and Powell being Cairo has been playing incredible but there's a bug going around the team right now I don't know who all it's impacting I know Paulo looked like he was gassed from the tip-off last night so I think it was just one of those games that you just you take it you throw it away from a fantasy perspective betting real life NBA I don't think you really learn anything about the magic this is a beat-up team right now half the roster including funds Wagner is out so so what can you really look at and say okay well we have these Grand takeaways about them and where they're at the bottom fell out they need to get healthy they got a couple days off  to me and this is this is the what I love the most about working these games is you know I know the magic well because they're always there but it's I get a good up close and personal view of the opponents and in some of these teams I feel like I learned so much more when I'm at the arena than when I'm watching on TV the Minnesota Timberwolves are so for real and I think it all starts with Karl Anthony towns I'm seeing a level of aggressiveness and assertiveness almost acting like a bully on the court that I'd never seen from him this is a guy who's always had skill his ability to shoot the three at his size to handle the ball he's got size so yeah he's always been a great rebounder and and fantasy managers like yourself known about Karl Anthony towns that appreciated him for a long time but I wouldn't ever say that cat was playing winning basketball and and I think it always kept the upside of Minnesota I think something has clicked something has changed they didn't even need Anthony Edwards last night if you look at the stat line it looks like he got hurt he just stood there he dealt with a little bit of foul trouble but it was all Carly Anthony towns Rudy gobert is a menace and I'm definitely a t-wolves buyer in terms of playoff success  yeah Anthony Edwards had I would say pretty in arguably his worst game in the year right I mean it was seven shots five turnovers and 26 minutes just didn't really need them like you said to me Minnesota led by 17 at the end of the first quarter they pushed that lead to 30 at the half and it was pretty much so up at that point Karl Anthony towns went over his points prop I have time I think it was 21 and half last night he finished with 28 so good because one of them go give a sick going in to last night's game I didn't even realize that until after they had tipped off but he wasn't feeling well and then you had a mockers are good offensive piece not a great defender and and Wendell Carter Juniors out so you have a sick you have a sick defensive Center and and an offensive backups so it wasn't a great recipe for stopping those two Twin Towers that's what's kind of a throwback rotation for the magic this feels like two or three years ago where you got two Mochi starting play 27 minutes going one of ten from the field as two boeke does yeah almost felt bad for bad Karo and so today I actually love what he's been giving them but like you said he wasn't 100% last night he got foul trouble early only played 17 minutes I mean Kayla Houston started alongside sucks in the backcourt he goes three of 12 you're not gonna win a ton of games when he got two starters combining for four of 22 shooting and then you know right now they're bench unit is just it's rough I mean you got to relevant Queen you got Anthony black playing way more minutes than he probably should you know Cole Anthony played last night I got hurt like seven minutes in didn't come back the time injury you know Wagner and big hero I thought were kind of the only two positives so I write last night what about markelle fultz yeah we spent a lot of time on this podcast trying to speculate and look into you know the crystal ball as to you know when he could come back he's been back down for two games he's played 15  and 13 minutes respectively Off the Bench it what have you seen from him there's just no confidence in his shot and I mean that from anywhere on the floor it doesn't seem like he's confident that when he releases the ball is going to go in and I think we saw him start to come around last year a lot of that was due to time and repetition and and it took a while for him to get to a point where you know he found his spot on the court that elbow jumper that that he had started it started to come around it started to look a little bit more like what we saw at you dub but I'm watching this guy in warm ups and it looks broken and then you see it what Mark yeah I know no way what write that one down put that up as a headline on road a wire but it felt like he was starting to get over that a little bit last year and this injury has just every every bad habit that he has in terms of the shot motion and shot selection it just seems like all of that has come roaring back so he is tough to trust right now for the magic definitely not somebody that you can rely on in fantasy and I just don't I don't know when it changes and you're coming up to a deadline where the magic have some decisions to make here and markelle fultz between his inability to confidently shoot the basketball even around the room and his injury history would not be shocked at all to see him become somebody else's project moving forward  yeah folks I don't even think he's a hold right now and in most fantasy League's I wrote an article for the site that went up yesterday and it'll be up on Yahoo today as well kind of looking at some  you know someone high owned players you could be dropped you know we're not talking like somebody's 2% owned like yeah you could you could cut bait on I don't Kiki but it's you know guys hovering around 50% roster and I was pretty surprised when Dale Carter is still rostered in 48% of Yahoo League's at least as of yesterday afternoon I'm done with him I'm cutting him pretty much everywhere I know he's kind of dealing with a new injury now he's just three games in a row even if he's back I mean every game that he's played in he just he's not he's not had like a single like whoa Okay window Carter he's back type of performance like even when you when he stayed healthy for stretch of games and started I think both Patsy and Wagner have been better than him this year I completely agree because they brings it on the defensive end in a way that Wendell Carter Junior doesn't and last night you know not withstanding that was a bad performance from GoGo but we detail why he was sick and clearly less than 100% and mo Wagner is such a spark plug for that that second unit is really but really anchored by Cole Anthony and mo Wagner and they're in their production you look at bench if you look this up on nba.com their bench points as a unit their fourth best in the NBA that's mold Wagner and Cole Anthony that are helping that stat stay afloat the way that it has so I don't know where window Carter Jr fits in to to that equation when you you factor all of that in and the fact that he's not playing I'm completely with you I think in the fantasy circles he's living off of reputation a little bit but this is a completely different circumstance we're living in right now yeah yeah I was looking back at that draft class 2018 I mean that was a long time ago obviously and you know the top of that draft looks pretty decent you know obviously Luca and Trey young and Jaron Jackson ended up being better than the top two picks eating and Bagley but I don't think you look back and say that was you know one of those like oh man what could have been type of pics I mean the guys that went directly after Wendell Carter Collins sex in and Kevin Knox and you know later on you got called Bridges at 10 sa at 11 miles Bridges  at 12 she's 14 it's like yeah those would have been nice but I don't I don't really recall anybody clamoring for SGA or or Bridges to go seven in that draft no I mean it's hard to remember exactly where we were at in terms of like obviously window Carter was drafted by Chicago but again it feels like you know I don't I think Orlando made the right pick at the time like I one of my bigger misses over the last few years as I was I was a big bomb guy I thought that was gonna work yeah I thought he was the type of player who was going to like he never looked great at Texas I was like no he's the type of guy that's gonna succeed in an MBA system and it's just as an app well it's all you know it's it's it's it's work ethic and the the want and desire these things that you can't test at a combined that's what's held Mo Bamba back it's not size he can shoot the three you know he can do a lot of the things as a seven footer that you want on your NBA roster and if that's sitting there at 6:00 you know you do it all over again so sometimes it works out sometimes it doesn't well that's all that in the midst of the Orlando like length raid drafting oh my God whatever just like all right whoever's got to walk his wings band we're taking that guy doesn't seem to matter not sure they're over that just yet yeah right see it's a good questions in the chat keep stacking those up we will hit those at about five or ten minutes just gonna talk about a few more takeaways from Tuesday nights maybe look ahead at some of the games on our big Wednesday nights like that's a fun ones we'll Celtics that'll be a big one first Pistons you know kind of battle the Bottom Feeders interested to see you know how much we see of women Yama tonight and then he Thunder we'll be a really fun one as well I mean Brandon I was thinking about that he Thunder game and yeah we won't have Jimmy Butler so some of the luster maybe he's wearing off that one but he thundered for a while you know if you rewind like 10 years that was that was like a premier matchup obviously those teams met the NBA finals and that got me thinking what was would you say was your absolute peak of like NBA fandom maybe it's right now because you cover a team and obviously it's not like I've slowed down over the last 10 years but I would say around like when I was like a sophomore junior in college that's what I was like the most  absolute locked in it was like I am planting my entire schedule to watch a heat Thunder regular season game  one that I'm in right now is I'll call the Post covid era the love that I have and of course part of it is that I work with an NBA team and I'm at these games but it was the bubble  having basketball on In the Heat of the summer when everything is shut down I the level of love I felt for the that I have felt for the NBA from that point on has exceeded anything that predates it in my life so that's like its own era from the bubble till now  prior to that I would say that those  Grindhouse Pistons teams and the end of the LA Lakers run that's a pretty hot era for me and then when I was a kid it was all about Michael Jordan so it was like he was the only thing that mattered but I was obsessed with watching Bulls basketball like every kid in the 90s so those are my those are my three hottest arrows would be that I think if I were to track it yeah I would say like the LeBron heat era was when I was like the most locked in I think it just kind of you know I had a lot of free time in college I could just kind of sit back and watch games whenever I wanted like the the Miami Heat winning streak that was a big one like that was a I remember where I was ironically a Panama City Beach at a seafood restaurant where people ended up getting sick afterward when they when they stabbed the street losing to the Bulls other than that for me I kind of went through like a dark period from like 06 to 2010 like in high school I was I was way more of a college basketball guy at that point I was like obsessed with Pittsburgh basketball for some reason despite living in Green Bay like that was that was my squad and you know prior to that though I you know you were Orlando Magic I was the biggest Tracy McGrady fan on the entire planet I had one birthday where I got four Tracy McGrady jerseys that was too many seem cool at the time turned out to be too many and a story I had a long time listening to the spot of probably heard this before I my birthday is in Late July so you know back in the days of you know you bring like treats in  on your birthday I never got to do that and it was you know when you're like fourth of fifth grade that's a big deal you want to do that obviously now that would be like no I don't want to my mom one time brought in brought in a cake for Tracy McGrady's birthday rather than my birthday because I was not able to celebrate mine during the school year  well I mean that that is you talk about peak level of fandom right there he was at the arena the other day I should have I should have let him know God I love tea bags so much it was it was a problem I I'll give you a quick T-Max story I I would I am seed a celebrity basketball game that the last time the the Pro Bowl is going to be in Orlando this year it took a break the last time it was in Orlando I am seeed a celebrity basketball game it was mostly in a former NFL players Keenan Allen played in it he was the only current NFL player and Tracy McGrady he was the only former NBA player that took part in the game so I'm on the court with McGrady he was the nicest guy in the world and of course I mean this is a couple years ago he's still well retired at this point you talked about schooling everybody it was like he was on a different planet from everybody else and these are high level athletes that he was playing with but it just goes to show NBA skill even when it's older is on a  different level than anything we can even comprehend and he's still good yeah man he's got a kid who's coming up too it was gonna be I think a pretty decent High School recruit so maybe I'll have to Hitch my wagon there I think if I I've been around Tracy McGrady at League events I've never talked to him I would be that's like the most Starstruck in him and Ron Dayne are the two guys and I bet I bet raw Dane many times he's he's very available in Madison I'll tell you that he's just got a wandering around town if I ever met team back man I don't know what I would say I've like I've been around LeBron like you know I've been to a few All-Star games and you go to the media scrums and it's like oh there's a little broad James like I should be probably a little more Starstruck no tea back would be like three levels up from that all right I want to talk I want to talk Grizzlies real quickly and then we'll get to the questions in the chat you know one of these actually just came in and this is exactly what I wanted to discuss good question for James now that jaw is out for the rest of the season is it time to trade a wage Jared Jackson and if so who should I Target I am going through this exact same debate in the road to wire stake League I'm making a little bit of a charge you know I was sitting down here at the bottom of the standings been a good couple weeks of moving into you know potential eater territory this is a league where you just want to finish in the top half you do not want to be in the bottom half and you know Jared Jackson's been good obviously did not play last night doesn't seem like a major injury they're calling it just a bruised knee they got a few days off now they play a back-to-back Friday and Saturday my answer to this question would be I want to hold Jaron Jackson for a bit because you know we saw some pretty Explosive Performance is like I do think the the offensive ceiling now for Jerry Jackson's a little bit higher  I also think the efficiency could go down you know that the case we made early in the season was you kind of needs Jama rant to be the player that he could be like you don't really want Jared Jackson being your coach number one option he's just not an efficient scorer that's not really where his game is out right now so I would I would try to Ride This Out  for a few more weeks but eventually I think I'm gonna want to trade Jared Jackson because I think the Grizzlies have no choice but to kind of just view this as a loss season like they're not gonna be a buyer at the deadline and you know as much as I love Triple J and Desmond Bane and Marcus Smart those guys aren't gonna pull you into the postseason in a super competitive West so I I worry that the Grizzlies could be this year's version of the Jazz last year where you got you know you got a great like 65 games out of Lori Market in and then at the end of the year you know you got shut downs and things like that so I think you know hold Jaron Jackson maybe for another month and then at that point try to offload but if you want to do that sooner totally understandable I think you know what first of all where do you come in on Triple J and then we could talk about you know some potential trade targets yeah I I think now would be the time the only thing that makes me nervous about sending that trade offer today is that he's not available and I wonder if an injury would drive down his trade value but I like the mindset that James has here because I'm not sure a lot of people in your league are going to be thinking along those lines that was a big topic Jaren Jackson Jr first quarter of the season was really disappointing and it was the lack of a two-man game that John Morant possesses the the stress that that he causes to a defense opens things up for Jaren Jackson Jr he's a completely different player is JJ when John is an out there so I think it would be a good time as long as the the injury doesn't drive down that trade value too much I would look at guys just look at overall scoring look at the current rankings as they stand right now and maybe go like  five spots lower than were Jackson is and see if you can get a straight up deal that way yeah I mean you're not getting I don't think you're getting like Jayson Tatum or Anthony Edwards or guys like that who are kind of hovering and like the 15-20 range I'm looking over the last month that guys who have provided similar production I mean I think I would start with like Demotte bonus and again you're probably not getting him maybe you have to toss in a sweetener you know kristaps porzingis if you're if you're on the high end of him in terms of health I would not be doing that for steps right now yeah Jamie Miller does not played well of late I think you could maybe catch a frustrated Damian Lillard manager you know like the other night due to a personal matter just hasn't been shooting it well that could be kind of a my problem for your problem you know Lauren marketing writes about the same as Jared Jackson I think you might run into the same issues with marketing although the Jazz have played better of late yeah Albertson what do you think about Kate Cunningham I injured for injured I was just gonna say that I mean yeah I you know with Kate  obviously the Pistons have three wins and they could they could be a tag team but I don't think they need to take you know I don't think I don't think they need to pull cake cutting out from the lineup I mean these played almost every game this year and they have three wins so I'm not I'm not really worried about him as a shutdown I think that would actually be a pretty good one if you're looking for you know kind of a shake-up in terms of you know if this is a category League what you're targeting obviously you know it's completely different players but if you're looking to replace you know Jaron Jackson's blocks that's going to be pretty tough you know you could you could try to get like a walker Kessler or something like that but again I don't think you have to trade Jared Jackson right now but I would want to do it probably before or slightly after the All-Star break yeah I would also say this for for anybody that looks and goes hey well Memphis is fine they just won by 17 last night in Dallas and Kyrie Irving and Luka doncic played that is the the analogy I would use Nick is the you know a star  is about to go out of stars about to die  you'll  usually shines the brightest at that point and I think that that could be the case here  like computer was just making all sorts of noises I don't know that  yeah this is the this is the dying star that shines super bright before it goes out and it was great that they were able to do that emotional win for Memphis but I don't think that kind of thing is Gonna Keep Up no and yeah I I wanted to touch on you know is there anybody anybody you could Target you know with John Moran now out for the season and there's just not a whole lot there man like obviously smart Desmond Bane those guys are rostered everywhere you know Luke Kennard he's not a point guard but you know maybe some more minutes trickle to him if you need threes and I don't really mind picking him up I think you know from a minute's perspective it was John conchar who played 25 last night but Derrick Rose is also heard you know he's gonna factor into the mix like there's there's not really you know there's not a TJ McConnell stepping in for Tyreese Halliburton type of player here in Memphis at least not right now no you know it's good to see Marcus Smart out there but he's already I'm sure he's already rostered across the board  yeah I mean there's there is no replacement for John Morant I think the other guys you can see Desmond Bane's numbers are gonna go back up that'll be the biggest increase and if you have Marcus Smart maybe as a bench player throw him into your starting lineup but I don't think we're gonna see  you know I don't think we're going to see a lot of movement in terms of the other guys and and I do worry that Memphis could go into tank mode and this could look very different in Memphis within the next couple weeks I do think it's good for Desmond Bane I don't worry about him as much as I do Jared Jackson it's just gonna be higher volume for Bain and that's a good thing and he took 27 shots last night I don't think that's going to be a unique experience going forward so if they're if there is a you know kind of shorter term beneficiary is probably Bane let's get to some of the live viewer questions and we start with Ian he says thoughts on Josh Hart thinking about grabbing him in a nine cat 16 Team league and we're looking at rest of season value I've always had Josh Hart guy I feel like I roster him every year in a bunch of teams I mean it's really the rebounding right I mean got the out of position rebounding he's shooting guard eligible and assemblies you know normally listened as a small forward the rebound expected better of late you know he went through a pretty rough stretch through the the early middle portion of the season but last 10 games he's up close to 8 revs per game you know the scoring has been relatively down this season 3 point shooting is completely fallen off the cliff he's not giving you a whole lot on defense so I do think it is 16 Team league I don't mind rostering him  I mean it's good team good situation should be playing 25 to 30 minutes but he's probably a four game starter only he you know he's gonna give you those middle-of-the-road performance is with he gets hot he'll have a spike for a couple of games but Josh Hart is just kind of is what he is but you're a Josh Hart Guy Tom Thibodeau is a josh heart guy so he's not going anywhere shoots at a decent clip right now or I mean his three-point shooting could really use an improvement but you know you you're getting the rebounds you're getting occasional spurts where um where he's a contributor and the scoring department but Josh Hart is not going anywhere he's one of the more steady players in fantasy  Don sicario says morning all Raptor screwjob I see me he's referring to the RJ Barrett moving screen call last night that took what would have been go ahead three-pointers off the board Raptors end up losing 132 131 did you order numbers the fourth quarter disparity of free throws  that's what the Lakers do man there's no League they shot 23 4th quarter free throws the Raptors shot two more than you and I did it was 35 to 13 excuse me 36 to 13 in terms of total attempts for the night  crazy yeah that was if you have not if you've not watched  is it right ahkovak I think is how you pronounce his last name the head coach of the Toronto Raptors if you have not watched his rant yet when you're done listening to us do yourself a favor  yeah both both quickly and Scotty Barnes ended up following out late I mean Anthony Davis a pretty much by himself you know he had more free throws in the entire Raptors team he went 13 of 14 huge night for add Don does follow up with a good question here  should you trade but call bridges for Pascal siakam in a nine category League  hmm man everything's everything's coming up or after is these days I  yeah Mikhail Bridges is not  he's not taking that that real strong leap that that looked like he was going to early in the season or late last year I think I'd rather have Pascal siakam at this point  I would rather have the Occam right now I think the question is you know his past I'll see him on a different team in a month and does that help or hurt him well I it's I mean it's impossible to tell and I just can't make trades right now based on  who is and is not going to be dealt because we just don't know so I would just I would just eliminate that from  I mean you can think about it but I would eliminate that from your decision making process if you like Powell siakam better  a team that trades for him is probably gonna put them in a similar situation that he's in right now he's just specific type of player in terms of what he does and and I don't see that changing but you're more comfortable with the know on what you do know  and what he is in Toronto is certainly a fantasy viable asset I like what I've seen as of late I think the Raptors are playing a little bit better I love the way they looked like last night and scoring into the 130s gotta love that for Fantasy purposes yeah I think you're right to probably simplify this I to be honest I didn't realize how poor Bridges has been you know I'm looking at last 30 days he ranks outside the top 160 indeed category leaks which the efficiency is a big part of it like you know the the raw scoring numbers look okay at 42 the other night against Portland but even with that I mean he's shooting 39% from the field over his last 15 games you have 3-point shooting has been way down like the free throw shooting has been in the low 80s for a guy used to be better than that and you know perhaps the biggest of all he's averaging point nine steals plus blocks over the last 15 games so if you're not getting you know you're one and a half Steals and your point eight blocks or whatever it is from a call Bridges  that's that's a big part of the reason that he was being pushed into the top 20 in a lot of drafts so yeah right now we passed outcome has been a vastly better fantasy players so if you take the trade deadline concerns out of it and even if he goes somewhere else it's like it's not like he's just gonna be you know 13 points a game guy like he's gonna be a major player if he ends up you know being shipped out of Toronto so if you if you're on the receiving end of SEO come Don I would do this deal Kim Ron says Hey guys Rozier is on fire who can I Target a good question because lamelo ball could be back as soon as Friday if it's not Friday you should be in the next few games and you know Terry Rozier could still be plenty effective especially with Gordon Hayward currently on the shelf and likely to get injured again but you know where he's kind of that in that Desmond Bane situation right where it's like all right without mellow go crazy you're the number one guy with a metal comes back you're still a big factor but we have to lower your ceiling a little bit so I think now is the time to try to cut bait on Terry Rozier he's been a top 15 player over the last month now you're not you're not getting top 15 value for Rozier because if people are paying attention you know they'll know that metal is coming back but you know in terms of who you could Target does anybody come to mind you know I think obviously you know you try to aim high you know Fred Van Fleet tomorrow Rosen yeah maybe Jaron Jackson you've talked about somebody who could lose some value you could try to to get someone like a  Brunson or a market in or you know even I don't know if you're looking for more stability this is probably pretty underwhelming but like you know CJ McCollum anybody else come to mind for you I like the way the Spurs have been playing as of late and and if you're able to get this done in the next couple of hours I'm thinking he's gonna put together a pretty good stat line tonight I like Calvin Johnson I think maybe that could be a name that you target I know a keldon Johnson fantasy managers gonna be pretty frustrated with the up and down that that you're getting from him and just the San Antonio Spurs in general but if you've been watching their games they have been  much more predictable in terms of their performance and I think he's a big part of that  certainly somebody they handles the rock a ton so I think a player like that is realistic and and would improve your fantasy roster in the long term  I'm looking at a spur  and it depends what kind of League you're in like you know Calvin Johnson in a points League I think makes a lot of sense there are some downfalls in the category league but I think if you're looking for a one for one type of cell would be the guy in San Antonio for me Paul says trade question Austin Reeves or shade and sharp who'd rather have  I take reefs he has a shade on Sharp pre-season truth or I can't say that it is paying huge dividends for me but he's been good I just overdrafted him but right now I like the way that Austin Reeves has been playing as of late I  I tend to agree and I love the I love the passing stats that you get with Reeves as well if you're if you're in that category format  George says what's up Brandon and Nick just joined Happy New Year to you both happy New Year to you as well George appreciate the support and for watching along all right we'll Zoom through the rest of these we got about you know five ten more minutes cow chats says I have been a big truth or both McDaniels for many years but this year just hasn't worked out but it's Jalen McDaniels a viable stash with all the smoke around Pascal Seiko interesting question  hmm  yeah I again I I don't really know how to project forward who's going to get dealt there I think there are there are some guys where it is blatantly obvious I'm not sure that Pascal siakam is one of them they they already made a big move and trading OG and Obi and and that that might be it in terms of what they want to do to revamp this roster trading away All Star level players is not usually a winning formula and I know the Raptors have been aggressive one time in their existence but I don't think that's necessarily who they are so no I I'm I'm not buying into that  I will say if you're in a deeper league and you have like a stash spot it's not the worst idea to grab him before the trade deadline just in case you have to go back to last season when Jayla McDaniels plays like real minutes but in the 30s in which he played the most minutes he averaged 14 points 6 boards two assists 1.6 steals shot about 49% from the field that was a 30 game sample where we averaged about 31 minutes so I think there is a viability there but obviously you need to become to be traded all right Michael says Jane Ivy Marcus Smart or Trey Jones pick one who needs to go in a 10 team 9 cat leaked so we're looking for a drop here  well I think Marcus Smart we saw it last night without without John Moran and he's and that was part of the struggles that Memphis had early in the season not only did they not have John Marcus Smart was all so not available so I'm excited about him at least for right now so I'm definitely holding on him and Jaden Ivy I could say the exact same thing but in certain Cade Cunningham into the discussion who's out at least another 10 days and could be even longer than that so I think I think Trey Jones gets the X for me yeah it's definitely Jones or Ivy in a nine cat League I think I would maybe lean toward cutting Ivy because the turnovers you know I mean he's gonna turn it over three four times a Game Trader Joe's he started the last two if he continues to start and play 30 minutes I think he would easily be second behind smart for me it's just a matter of whether or not you trust that so I will I will assuming Kate cuttingham is back and like a week I would say cut bait on Jade and Ivy all right similar question keep in order smart Jones oh okay this is the same question but smart Jones or Ivy until Kate comes back yeah same thing for me I I like Ivy over Jones as long as Kate is out but if you're looking long term I think I would be comfortable cutting gate with Ivy we don't we just don't know what's gonna go on with the Pistons rotation Paul says I traded Booker and in Obi for honest thoughts  I love it good for you give me all the honest yeah I want Jana Ivy you got to live with the free throw percentage if you're in a category league but I think if you're okay with that and you're either doing well and you can offset it or you're just pumping that category I want Giannis I mean the Bucks have been a disaster of late but the one thing that's been constant is the honest being a complete machine every single night so I'm okay with that I know I know we just had a good game but I still think you're on the right side of that deal it doesn't seem like he's much of a factor offensively for the Knicks but they've gotten better since they traded for him so and and they traded for his defense they're getting that right now so it's a it's it's definitely a win for the Knicks  what do you guys make of the pseudo timeshare between vooch in rebound Legend Andre Drummond great question I I will say I kept Audrey drama did my weekly lineup in my most important League this week you know he's started the last game I think at some point you know they're gonna put food back in the starting lineup I don't see why they would continue to bring him off the bench but I mean drum it only needs like 17 minutes to still be like really fantasy viable right I mean he's got 25 rebounds over the last two games and he's only played 23 minutes in each of those so even if you goes back to you know 16 17 18 minutes off the bench I think he still a whole and you know I think they'll try to trade booster at the deadline I don't know if there's gonna be a taker he's kind of a weird situation you know age contract Effectiveness wise but I I'm holding Drummond I I'm definitely not giving up on him and until you know we see a market reduction in minutes or we get past the trade deadline and boots is still there and I we just have no idea like the Bulls to me are the team that they're roster could transform more than just about anybody's after the deadline and I think you know they if they kind of just go and play out the string mode maybe they toss the biggest Andre Drummond the rest of the way I mean I think I like I said I'm not getting rid of him I would I would certainly be holding Drummond  oh definitely I think about this so I'm looking at their numbers right now side by side Andre Drummond has played 500 less minutes this year then Nick vujevich and has five less rebounds  that's insane I mean they're they're raw numbers I mean they're totals outside of points scored really are not that different so Andre Drummond has been far superior fantasy player and if you're in that category League you don't have to worry about him taking your three-point percentage because he doesn't shoot them Nick vujevich on the other end does like to shoot the three he used to be decent at it it's dropped off this year shooting 28% from long range so yeah Andre Drummond right now  ah this is like a resurrection of sorts all right we'll go rapid fire through a few more of these just traded foods and Brandon Miller for McCall Bridges and a 14 team 12 cat league did I make the right move I need free throws made badly we just talked about bridges he always been in a slump of late but I think if you really need free throws made this is probably okay I mean boost just doesn't really get to the line at all that's been the case for a few years he's like he's at like one and a half attempts per game he's only taking like 55 free throws on the year so you know we're about to call Bridges but I also think you know we there's reasons to worry about food going forward Brandon Miller ultimately is a rookies you know showing some flashes but I think he made the right call here specifically if you need the free throws yeah rookies tend to not get to the line they don't get that respect from the officials he's the type of player the way that he plays were he'll get that as his career goes along you're right about vouch and bridges of vet you know how to get to the line  about to close a deal on Dame Lillard for Chet Holmgren should I do it  ten team points lie I think so yeah I'm fine with that yeah I mean damn is not been as bad as you think you know the lately it's been a disaster and you know I think some of the bad performances really stand out but on balance he's still been an elite fantasy player but if you're in a points League you know you're not you're not necessarily getting the free throw percentage boost and that's something that's massive with Lillard because he's taken a bunch of free throws he's hitting them at like 90% but yeah in a point so like I don't really mind chasing after Chet Holmgren here I mean I think the big concern with chat was Kenny stay healthy and he's answered that as affirmatively impossible so far so I think that's actually a pretty fair deal  all right how concerned are we about John morance 24 25 value he's already more of a point League guy and this is the kind of injury that can mess with your shot and take time to get back into Rhythm once you return fair question I mean Jaws missed a ton of time over the last few years he's always been a much better real life player than fantasy player I think there has been a disconnect there you know like like Chad points out he's a better Point Sleek guy I wouldn't say I'm super worried about like a shot breaking down and he's kind of a shaky 3-point shooter as it is it's to me it's just more the accumulation of multiple injuries yeah John Moran such an electrifying player and and knows how to get to the basket I don't worry as much about the shot because you can find other ways to score and  I mean we saw he was all that time he came back he was back to his old self in game one so I really don't worry about that in terms of him coming back it's just you know it's frustrating and you know shoulder injury could mess with them a little bit but I would say my level of my level of concern would be mild it's just frustrating that it's even happening  all right we'll do two more and then we got to get out of here this should be a quick one Bane for lamelo should he do it  I think I'd rather have pain I just the better players the better fan as he player I we went down this world last year he came back got hurt again you know Hornets are going nowhere right now man more tempting because I would much rather have lamelo Ball but I don't trust his health right yeah it's it's super tough I mean obviously lamelo's a better player nobody's debating that but it's just you trust him to be healthy and I don't really know if I do so to me it's like where are you in the standings if you're 8th right now  then yeah trade for the Mellow shoot for the upside if you're second in your league I think I would take the safety of Desmond Bane all right let's try it with that I think it's very very much dependent on what your record looks like Skeeter action I pick up folks from waivers talk about him earlier I would say no right now got to see him actually play real minutes he hasn't look good in the first two games it's coming back I would leave him alone for now all right well and on this one hey guys for a nine cat 12 team had to head league would you trade Steph Curry and OG&E to get SGA  hmm  yeah I think I would I mean the hard hard to ship off a guy like Steph Curry I think OG in an obese the perfect complimentary trade piece we already saw a solid trade come through where he was a part of that so it seems like you know for anybody else that's listening if you have OG and Obey clearly there's a market for him plus a superstar to improve your Superstar status and I think that's exactly what you're doing here SGA is gonna he'll be in the conversation for MVP at the end of the year SGA over the last 30 days of shooting 56% from the field that's the same Curries at 41% in that span so yeah you're never gonna feel good about trading Curry there's gonna be nights where he hits 7 threes and you're like what was I doing but no I want the SGA side of this and you have to pay up to get up like it's you can't do Curry straight up for SGA which says you know a lot about how great SGA has been this season so yeah I would I would do that deal I mean I think like you said ogea nobody's kind of the perfect swing piece and you know you're selling High you just played really well at his best game is Nick the other night but in general I think there's going to be a lot of ups and downs and defensive stats and kind of falling off the season for OG so knowing what you got to do to get a player like SGA this season I think I'm fine with that all right guys want to thank you for all the great questions which we could get to more
