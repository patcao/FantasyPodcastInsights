welcome everybody to the expertly produced an award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast it is brought to you by Underdog fantasy it's Friday December 15th 2023 Alex barutha here with Shannon McEwen and Ken k train Crites oh Lord  let's jump right into the news last night the Clippers beat the Warriors 121 to 113 in La Paul George was out for this game book of a day-to-day injury this was Draymond more nobly Draymond Green's first game serving his indefinite suspension  we had Brandon pajam ski and Jonathan coming to join the starting lineup because Andrew Wiggins was benched by coach Steve well he should be are airpods do not play that well too for 11 3 turnovers did grab seven rebounds we also had James Harden continuing his strong play posting 28 points 15 assists seven rebounds 402 minutes is that just to get them less fat the 42 minutes maybe they should play in 48 but yeah I mean Shannon we you know at the fantasy Community has been like is it kamen's is it is it Moody does anything you saw from this game make you feel strongly about any of those guys I mean I'm gonna lean most heavily on minutes and also the fact  that pods airpods and comica entered into the starting lineup like that's the biggest news right so those two starting make them the two obvious pickups for me there are two guys we're gonna talk we're going to talk about both guys later those are the two guys I was planning on calling out either way but there's going to be other Fallout from the dream on suspension I mean one we don't even know how long train owns out for so to be determined it could have been a short term add a long-term to be determined but you've got Kevon Looney you know he had an easy game let me back up to that channel it was eight games for strangling gobert right so it doesn't have to be five oh it's fine oh eight days maybe five games okay I mean yes it'll be I would just assume it's at least five games right yeah so and my history will come into play you know but it could be anywhere from for if my personal take is I won't be surprised if it's five games again I won't be  surprised if its 25 games 2B determined right but right now you've got airpods he entered the starting lineup basically received the start over Andrew Wiggins who was the first ball over Chris Paul too over Chris Paul yeah but Wiggins was the guy in the starting lineup and then kamego starting as well we'll say that he took draymond's place in the starting lineup I am surprised that Chris Paul did not earn a start but he still played 20 minutes off the bench 12 points three assists to rebounds I think you've got  Chris Paul is going to see a nice boost with dream on out Kevon Looney a nice boost he had eight seven and five last night and 26 minutes Looney's had a lot of games where he has even has even top 20 minutes so I think we'll see him play 256 minutes on a much more regular basis with dream on out and then coming and only about Dario sorry she played well during greens last suspension didn't have a particularly notable game last night but I think sorry should his size  they're going to need him with with green out you know one thing also about airpods I didn't put this in the notes sorry Alex but you also had four stocks and pods hustles on defense which I'm sure the warrior coaches have noticed I think they're going to like his  I don't know active hands and he's freaking out he's always moving around accessibly on defense for stocks last night if three steals one block I like the stocks from pods as far as debating your pickups here  Ken let's let's go to an upset victory yeah Bulls upset the heat in Miami 124 116  fantasy darling Kobe white with 26 points  shot four of 11 from behind the arc 11 dimes so he wasn't just gunning and I love this zero turnovers he had a Halliburton game double digit assist with zero turnovers DeRozan had 23 points lose to which had 24 points  gentlemen are there Bulls better without Zach LaVine there's their five and two during Levine's foot injury absence and have wins over the heat pelicans and box  they might be I mean I it's just awesome that Kobe white is getting an opportunity I think he's kind of been underserved since he joined the MBA in terms of opportunities being pigeonholed into a bench role so it's good to see him get out there and do some stuff are they better without Levine I mean I don't think Levine was giving his best effort let's look at that way and this is allowing them to go a little more defensive Focus you know Kobe white is shooting is going to pull back a little bit but a little more Pat Williams Caruso Tori Craig to soon move like those guys are all good Defenders right so they can kind of lean on to rows and vujevich and white and and leading some more defense and they get I mean it was an upset Victory against the Heat but the heater also extremely short-handed right now and no damn no bam but yeah I mean it terms of family  Shannon is there anything going on do you think in Chicago that we still need to act on or is it just like obviously you have to roster Colby white and every League Pat Williams maybe still like it's soft add and like 12 teams kind of a situation  yeah yeah similar similar to past weeks when we discussed it I mean Elks career so would be an option but he's been in and out of the lineup seems like every single game even when he does play he ends up leaving early because of injury but you just you know again I'm gonna lean heavily on minutes play it's starting lineup Pat Williams 32 minutes last night Kobe white 40 minutes Kobe White's been an absolute Beast for you know the past two weeks and it's wild to me because even though on the DFS side of it looking at Kobe white I I'm I imagine Kobe what's what's Kobe White's roster percentage right now it's gotta be in the 80s yeah well let's confirm that while I'm talking about on the DFS side you know with with Kobe white he has been a walking 40 45 fantasy points hitting 50 some nights and he hasn't topped out he hasn't reached 8,000 salary yeah on FanDuel or DraftKings but he's been a must plug in the first option I plugged into my lineup the past six seven days anytime the Bulls are on the Slate and it's wild to me he's always his roster percentage is always very low under 10% I think he's probably around seven or eight percent on both sites last night I don't understand that as long as he's below 8,000 I think he's a must start in DFS manage an 81% of season long Yahoo leagues too low way too low and I gotta say tip of the hat to the solo last night shot 10 of 12 that won't happen every night but 24 points a boards five assists had to steal in there it's not gonna happen every night but nice to see a good call out Ken because I agree I mean he had 35 minutes that was largely due to Alex Caruso yeah leaving the game after five minutes of action but the sumu you know he had he pulled a Tony Snell the other night had zeros across the board despite playing like close to 30 minutes that shouldn't deter folks fear in a deep enough League specially if Alex Cruz so does Miss some more time to sumu is worth a flyer he's gonna have some Duds he reminds me of like he's very much like a Terrence Mann type option where he's gonna have just total Duds for games but pop off everyone in a while and probably provided enough values specially in like four game weeks for for deeper 14  teams maybe deep rostered 12 teams as well  Alex take us to the news out of Utah yeah this isn't this isn't like breaking news but we have Jordan Clarkson's out for two weeks in Utah keyonte George also to be reevaluated after this road trip you avoided a serious injury got an MRI but it's still of concern that they were worried enough to get an MRI clearly he was in pain not feeling well somehow the Jazz still get a decisive 122 114 win over Portland I say decisive because it was garbage time in the fourth should know scoot Henderson went for a 20 and 10 game in a lot of that garbage time to straight for straight straight outings so um Marketing in Collins were all so out this game this was the first time all year Portland was favored to go basketball game and yet they lost we had Colin Sexton play 32 minutes 27 points and 17 shots forces to rebounds in one steal we had Taylor Horton Tucker 23 points in 19 shots forces for steals to rebounds Chris Don got in a little bit  6 points at 5 assists and no Chaya bogey 16 points  we again we know Clarkson's out for two weeks  the keyonte George situation is a little iffy I hesitate to say Sexton and Taylor Horton Tucker and Donna like mustad players because we don't know about it Jackson's a mustad we'll get to that in the free agent picks all right it's only taking a year and a half but we've been doing it do we are due it's sexy time  that's that's tackles it everybody I would say okay so maybe that maybe maybe the better question is do you because people ask about this actually on Nick and I's Monday pot a lot do you drop keyante George and I've been pretty firm I don't think you dropped Kanti George in 12 team leads to spite the shooting percentage struggles  and I would drop them for Sexton only because the field goal percentage from George has been consistently High 30% and he shot the same in college so I don't I keep hoping that field goal percentage for George terms around but I don't think it's gonna happen  I I think he's a whole I a lot of folks held him prior to his Ascension to the starting lineup for the Jazz yeah and even before the December 13th game against the next one he left with that injury he had his best game of the season 44 fantasy points 30 points 7 assists three rebounds five three-pointers made five for nine from downtown I'm holding them you know they the latest news is avoid Serious injury that's the headline so yeah you have to miss them this weekend but hopefully he's back in short order next week  um I in the chat uh Brooks Durham says he's holding on to George because he's already punting field goal percentage absolutely because the right call so yeah we try to provide blanket advice right but understand it depends on your league what you're punting what your bill is stuff like that so that's a good note Ken let's go to the Spurs yeah Zach Collins got in the boot out of the starting lineup so that Victor went by Yannick can play center in three games since when be started playing Center 22 points 17 rebounds five blocks three assists 1.3 Steals and 1.7 triples  he almost carried them to the wind two nights ago shoot who was that was that against the Clippers I can't remember but Lakers yes I was La yes Spurs though as we just implied have lost all those games still in fact they're on some kind of crazy losing streak I don't know if they're in Pistons territory yet but they got to be closed and they've lost those three games by an average of almost eight points Wendy is now up to the 15th ranked player in eighth category leagues for total season stats meanwhile want fantasy darling Zach Collins with his bench time over those three games averaging only eight points 5.3 rebounds and just under 19 minutes a game  yeah it's awesome we're seeing women play at least well I can see to be his true position at Center will they play Trey Jones at his true position and start them at point guard know but to me this is bigger news for college I mean you know fine I used to I would prefer to hold him in 12 weeks because we know he's good per minute but I understand if you are  struggling in your league and this happens that you just you just need stats I understand wanting to drop Collins because I don't think they're going back to starting him but if you're in a position of strength in your league I would prefer to hold College I think the play here is if you're a wemb manager to buy Collins now on the cheap to have him handcuffed wemby because I still feel like that injuries coming  that's that's my advice it is tough I roster accounts and a few spots you know in our stake League I have him I believe that's 14 Team league I mean right 60 yeah 60 yeah I'm keeping them there he's probably gonna be on my bench most weeks but the you know most of the waiver wire options that we highlight on a weekly basis are not available in that week so I'm going to keep them there but if it's a 10 or 12 team her specialty with shallow benches in a 12 team her 10 team absolutely dump them off find a different top 120 piece there's probably someone who's got some short-term value that's worth streaming in but even 12 teams if it's short badge I feel the same way I think that Collins is disposable well said well said Alex about our friends at Underdog I would

to hit show on one here just traded away marketing  kuzmin Melton kuzmin for saying goon and Tatum can you rate this trade um  that's an interesting trade I think I I think I'm good with the sengun Tatum side I think that's a fine trade you got the two best players in the deal Mark and it's fantastic when he's healthy but he hasn't been that this year I think Utah is going to be selling at some point if marketing gets moved to a different team especially if it's Contender it's very unlikely that he'll be option one a for any team he gets traded to you right like even if it's a team like the Pistons you know let's just talk this into existence for a minute let's say the Piston straight for marketing I still put him as the number two option behind Kayden that scenario so even if it's a struggling team or San Antonio same thing right Wendy would be option A so I love Shane goon and I think that side gets the two best players in the deal and if frees up a roster spot for you where you can stream in a hot pick up each week  so they say kuzmin yeah who's Mom sorry about that a little Panic there reading the notes yeah Tatum you kidding me come on top five player never gets hurt  that's the trade all right next question  is Carousel Levert a long-term 10 team or 12 team at I'm okay with the idea of adding them in in 12s just because we know is upside when when Mitchell and Garland this time and also you know Cleveland's bench I don't have a ton of faith and in general I think I think liver it's going to continue to play six-man minutes I don't know a 10 team you need to add him because I think a lot of times there's guys off the waiver wire who are mostly doing the same stuff so I it's fine for 12 yeah  anything to add Chan no I agree I think he's a 12 team or much more than a 10 team or 10 teams got to be pretty deep rosters to to have a bird in there he's gonna pop off right you know in that bench role especially when the calves are short-handed with Garland or Mitchell missile time you know Mobley is out right now which is part of the reasons why maybe very had a big game last night but I don't think he's a must roster in 1 2  all right one last one about the about news in Utah if John Collins is getting traded well tailor Hendrix be a mustad I'm thinking Elsewhere on that depth chart but what do you guys think I don't know if Hendrix will be a must add I mean if if John Collins or marketing we should say got traded because I think both those guys are I I don't know what they're willingness to trade Collins is but  yeah I mean I wouldn't wouldn't I'm gonna mispronounce this name but one Fawn teach you on tensio oh yeah contact you take you  yeah he's he's just not he's not that good or interesting like he's Kelly old Nicks like younger brother  play wise that's why yeah um look I don't I won't get personally this isn't exactly what you're asking but I think in a way it's like hey is is Taylor Hendricks a stash you know if I'm gonna 14 team leader or something like that do a shark a stash Taylor Hendricks I don't think you do but I'm interested to see what you think Shannon I'm gonna come up on the other side of that in a 14 team or yes I do think he's a stash in the likely because Collins there's been a lot of trade Buzz with Collins the last couple days so you know I I think it makes sense for you to trade him I think that's one of the reasons why they acquired Collins they thought it's a low cost acquisition that we're getting here we'll see if it works if it doesn't we'll find a different destination for him that's another guy you know let's talk it to into existence here the Detroit Pistons should trade I'm okay and another big man they need a big man who can put it on the floor a little bit and hit threes I know what John Collins does and I know that he does it better than Isaiah Stewart so yes the answer is yes they don't need John Collins so Hendricks but evaluating herricks you know he did get recalled from the G League back in December 2nd he's been in the rotation and for the Jazz since then so over the past six games he's averaging 21 minutes off the bench six points 2.8 rebounds he had 10 and 7 last night with the steel I two for five from downtown which might be might have been as one of his bigger question marks is Ken he stretch the floor this this student is career I I'm a big fan of Hendrix I like his his potential on the defensive side to rack up stocks 14 team I think he's worth the stash if Colin's gets moved I think he's worth the stash in 12 teams you know all that said if it comes to point where he is put into the starting lineup at some point then yes you must have  I might scoop up the clinic I might go for a clinic of a trade is done there but we shall see sure all right gentlemen it's now time  for the the big bunny segment the waiver wire section Alex take us there  like you said because the big money segment this is how this works we have two regular waiver wire picks that are roster and less than 50% of League's and then one long shot pick roster and less than 25% of the League's in terms of scheduling next week not as busy as this week but still only one team has two games and now because the Phoenix Suns so keep that in mind every other team obviously plays three or four my first suggestion for the waiver wire is Dante Exum a name I thought I would never speak again in my entire life how old do you think he is by the way how old are I think he is I've looked this up because in my head he's always like 19 years old I'm not looking it up he's 28 he is 28 bam Alice way to go I honest to God that was a complete shot in the dark um so Kyrie Irving is gonna walking boot after I look that injury Kyrie suffered we he is lucky that that was not like seizing her career ending that was crazy when Dwight Powell fell on him like that but over the past five games at home has been in the starting lineup  averaging 17 points 5 assists five rebounds and a steal now he's shooting 59% from the field he's shooting 57% from three those are going to come down you know like first career he's like a 30% 3-point shooter in the NBA but then last year he's in Europe and he shot like 37.38% now he's back in the league and he's he's out of control shooting hot  but I'm not Europe a boy he came back a man he did he actually gave a lot of weight he's he's pretty imposing good Defender as well I think it's he he's a good addition to their lineup the maps are on a four-game week right so even if a shooting comes down a little bit you're doing well he can pass you can defend 42% roster on Yahoo I don't know if I said that I to me he's got to be an ad we don't know how long Kyrie is out for  yeah I like that a lot and frankly  they've been struggling to figure out who the wings should be on this team why not Exum he's playing out of his head love it  who is a oh go ahead I do with axim you know the big question marks for me is what happens when Kyrie returns so five straight starts some of those with Kyrie but Grant Williams was out for a little stretch there yeah Derek Jones junior miss a gamer too last night Derek Jones Junior and Grant Williams both played so you had some essentially played the two he had walked from minutes at the three is a starter previously so what happens when Kyrie returns do they move Derek Jones junior or Grant Williams to the bench and keep them in the starting lineup I think it's possible because he's been so damn good but it is something to watch he might only end up being a short term at definitely worth an ad though all right exams a nice cute add but the big ad is the big sexy boys Colin Sexton we've only been preaching this for a year and a half but it's finally happened finally happening sectors is about to explode he's 54% roster on Yahoo 32% on ESPN as we mentioned in the news section Clarkson's out for at least two weeks keonte George we don't know yet waiting on that MRI results he could be out for a while last night in Portland Sexton got his second start in a row 27 points to rebounds for assist hit two threes while shooting on 117 from the field over 30 two minutes great to see we don't know which Fords are getting traded from this team whoever gets dealt will mean more shots for Sexton but it's not just last night section over the last seven games almost 19 points over four assists while shooting over 54% from the field and Elite free throw  shooting 94% Utah has four games next week so take the big sexy dive and give Colin sex in a try baby I think that's a good note yeah I mean it's it's again we don't know about about George he's worth an ad until we know and even if he does come back let's say two games into the week Sexton should still do enough in those next two games with Clarkson out to make it worth worth your while  Shannon where are you going for your first waiver wire add we hit it at previously and these you know my first ad and my second ad are both going to come from the Warriors branded pajam ski airpods we were gonna recommend him as a pickup even before he was announced as a starter last night prior to last night's game five games preceding that he averaged 12 points 72 7.2 rebounds three assists One stock per game 1.63 pointers salad percentage well so field goal percentage free throw oh only 33% over that stretch but he's not taking many free throws at the stage of his career so it's not going to be too damaging I love me some airpods I think he's an electric player he's fun to watch he fits the Warrior system well I would not be surprised if he's even whether he started or not you know over those that five-game stretch as a non-starter which still seen 28 minutes per I think he's gonna see Heavy minutes that 25 to 30 range you know even if he ends up coming off the bench again in the near future he is worth a pickup in most 12 team leads definitely in 14 teams he's rostered in about 30% a week a little bit of that right now go scoop him up  very nice well-rounded player like you mentioned 14 points and I agree bounds for CIS per 306 also averaging a steal their about 0.9 fantasy points per minute so if he's getting 30 minutes he's roster stable in 12 team points as well as category League's I think his stocks are going to be awesome he's a super hustle defensive guy  my second waiver wire suggestion is my man  tari Eason I've been waiting so long to say this name he is on you know I really need to make like an Alex burrito sort of like fantasy I don't even know like my guys because it's like a video cover guy at least once last season at least once I think it's just it's exciting for one of your guys to actually be good I know out tari Eason Nas read other guys along these lines are some of my favorites Ethan 34% rostered in Yahoo leagues the past two games these are his totals 43 points 28 rebounds three steals two assists like a block in 54 minutes  look we saw it last year what he could do per minute there's a reason people were drafting Easton in the back end of probably their deeper League drafts this season per 36 this year's averaging 16 and 13 with two assists I think it's too Steals on a block or two blocks going to steal I don't know why I didn't write down which was which but Houston also plays four games this week so if you have any concerns about his minutes  maybe he only plays 17 a game because men's back and guys are healthy I think you can still get value because again permanent he's crazy and with the upside of him playing closer to 25 minutes a game to me he's just got to agol all these hot  I'm playing Jeff Green Houston and years old there's no future in Jeff Green stop it  oh man all right Ken who's your second who's your second ad I say a heart and Stein backup center for your New York Knicks 45% roster than Yahoo Mitchell Robinson is out until early February now this happened last year and last year they started Sims but hartenstein would always get more minutes in the last five games hardenstein a little over six points but nine rebounds and almost one and a half blocks while shooting  55% from the field the Knicks have only three games next week this is more of a two Center league if you need to throw third Center for a few weeks heart and sign probably limited upside but actually passes well for a center too and anyway I like him back up Center in Tucson Center League's yeah hartenstein absolutely worth a pickup in 12 deep 12 teams 14 teamers shallower formats I'm staying away we've all been waiting for the heart and Stein breakout forever it's never going to happen like a true breakout from art and sign you know even last year when Mitch Robb was out you know what did the next do they brought in Taj gift Gibson guess who they just resigned Taj Gibson I want to know can somebody do what was Taj what was 38 year old Taj Gibson doing the last few months I I picture him in a suit selling Insurance what do you what do you think he was like 10 to a garden or something just like completely relaxed and we're just Tomatoes yeah alright guys another one of my guys who's my list and yeah I don't think of tips showing up like in some in a Honda Civic with a giant Nick sticker I like I'll tell you what the guy who has over 86 million dollars in career earnings was doing for the past six months not selling  cars not a  enjoying working his garden who's yours second pick yeah as in to that another another Warrior Jonathan kaminga 21 year old foreword for Golden State kaminga started playing very solid even before the Draymond suspension in the previous five games he had played 22 minutes off the bench average 15 points five rebounds One stock 58% from the floor hitting 1.63 pointers his 3-point shot definitely looks you know it looks more true this year a special in the last couple weeks then it hasn't passed seasons  I think this is the opportunity to mingi needs he's had he's had similar opportunities in the past but the fact that he was already getting priority minutes over Andrew Wiggins before Draymond Green suspension now he's in the starting lineup I do like him better in point space League's then rotisserie leagues but if it's 12 team her or deeper I am scooping up Camilla and hoping that he can seize this role and hold on to close to 30 minutes per night long term with these Warriors  The Warriors dealing comingo moody maybe some pics to get either Collins or marketing I could see that maybe what they should do if they're making a deal like that  they should just  move on it's time to hand over the reins to the young guys and Curry get rid of Draymond get rid of clay but Warriors fans don't want to hear that and they're gonna think I'm crazy  out of the week  it's another one of my guys Matisse the Bible the opposite yeah I'm sorry if I put together an actual NBA roster of my guys they'd win well more games than the Pistons but still not very Wendy Wendy Wendy has one more win the Pistons that all right I don't want to hear it the Savior has one more win than the Pistons the Pistons if based on that measure alone the Pistons are over performing  I'm surprised we don't get more comments stop talking about the Pistons  yeah oh you know no one else is so you know it's a it's a bit of a safe space let's get to your big not sexy pick for a long shot here yeah look they only have three games next week this is not really like a short-term add necessarily Ken's falling asleep this is more of a long-term deeper leak play because he's 19% rostered in in Yahoo League's right now the look last game is not a good example because he played 17 I got blown out by Utah team over the past two weeks he's ranked 91st um and we know he's a we know who Matisse Bible is he's sitting threes a little more this season it's three points shooting actually a 42% this year he's hitting a three and a half per game but 1.5 steals 0.7 stocks and 24 minutes he's playing more than that lately he started the past three games  if you're in a 16 Team league you just have to roster him I'm sorry to break it to everybody you have to roster him  well you know I'm embarrassed to say I have a pick almost as boring as yours Alex I couldn't think of a fun long term pick so I just went safe  with Tori and Prince of the Lakers he's only managed in 13% a league Lakers do have four games next week unlike tables three and hey last three games almost 16 points four rebounds almost five triples while shooting 59% look is he gonna stay that hot no of course not but he might for a few more games next week Lakers have four if you need if you're roster has got too many three games guys or even a Phoenix Sun on it this might be the time to add just stream prints for a week or two yeah we we started the waiver wire section with some very sexy pics literally yeah now we're like no horse I'm in a wrap up with Vermin complex yeah the third the third non-sexy option Malachi Branham San Antonio Spurs he's part of that new look starting lineup for the Spurs random has started eight of the past nine games but he's picked up his production in the past three over that the latest three games he is averaging 28 minutes 14 points 3 rebounds three assists and 1.33 pointers I don't think Branham has much upside but he can help out in points in three-pointers enough that he could be an option in 14 teams and very deep 12 teams but I would not look at I would not even consider them in Shallow her 12 teams or 10 team leads I think he's gonna keep getting minutes because his defense has been really good but  famously wise you know we'll see we shall see he drops you guys want to suggest any drops I see some names here on the notes yeah I mean some of these names are guys that we we've had questions about in other streams interesting names we talked about Zach Collins already um Shannon and I discussed that but if you if you missed the first part of the show I think he's a hold and probably 14 team or 16 teams 12 if you're playing well you can hold them if not I understand if you want to drop other two names you know Dillon Brooks is on here we get questions about him to me he's a drop I was I wrote an article or early in the year I think I think in like three articles I was begging people to sell hi I'm like you have to take literally any player that you can get back for Dillon Brooks from somebody else but my question to you shangaan and this is a much more difficult question than the Dillon Brooks  Jalen green  are we we're waiting we're still waiting patiently waiting  is it time to maybe drop him know I'm holding I'm holding green  at least for a little bit longer you know the Rockets are just lucky they have a lot of young players who are showing out and greens had some struggles but I am holding on the green I mean he you know he just had a 47 Fantasy Point out in a couple weeks ago he's in a little bit of a rough stretch shooting the last handful of games but I expect that to bounce back you know the real question is will he ever be more than a Points Guy which I I questioned because he doesn't do anything over the past five games while his shot has been broke he has zero Steals and zero blocks as well so you know and he's only averaging about two assists per game in that stretch so if he's not scoring is he going to be doing other things  it's unlikely at this stage hopefully that changes but I do I am holding him I have a different drop despite being locked into the starting lineup and despite you know our audience likely desired to have us not talk about the Pistons  it's time it is time to drop beef stew Isaiah Stewart for the Piston's the the Pistons have switched up their starting lineups some and beef stew is moved to the starting five Jalen Dorrance out Marvin Begley's out so that's part of the reason why they've done that but I do believe that Stuart will not be long for the Pistons starting lineup and even in his starts you know looking at the well we'll stretch it out and look at the past eight games he's averaging 8 points in 6.1 rebounds with half a stock 0.4 steals 0.1 blocks he is  not conducive who's arguing with Shannon on this  probe students still he's still  after an over 50% a week so I I like he is locked into the starting lineup and that's one of the biggest barometers for is this guy worthy of a starting lineup is it getting the minutes with beef stew yeah he's getting the minutes he's in the lineup but he's not productive enough and I do think this this team you know we might even see  Jay we might see James Wiseman enter the starting lineup at some point but definitely when during returns I think Stuart's out he's gonna be a backup big man for this team and you're gonna have a sar top it's good news for us our Thompson it's good news for by zdanowicz some of these other guys I expect the Pistons will go with the smaller lineup than they did previously when during or Bagley we're we're healthy yeah sorry what's that Pete what's that Pete tell Shannon to stop talking about the Pistons yeah I'll get on that thank you let's go to shed and other real core strength  which is not necessary in addition to stock is his fabulous DFS advice I don't want to brag for Shannon but I'm gonna he's been flashing this big money winning's lately I don't know why he's shaking his head he should be very proud of how well he's done lately we got an eight-game slate tonight Friday December 15th gentleman dive into your DFS advice  yeah we don't we don't have like  as many major injuries that sometimes we do but we got no ad and LeBron obviously their questionable Baines questionable or pools questionable Mark Williams is doubtful and I just want to note this Mark Williams thing  the Hornets love to use the doubtful tag when a guy is gonna be out like a month or two months and they just  waved the O'Malley done a guard  and picked up a center  off of the off of free agency so  I just keep that in mind maybe a little Nick Richards off the waiver why we didn't mention his name but if you're if you're trying to be a little sneaky and you're in a deeply maybe a little Nick Richard see what's going on there new fans of the show should know that Alex every day is updating all the injury news so when he talks about A team's injury  Behavior he is the expert at RotoWire of teams not giving good info ah yeah I hate the Hornets um okay Shannon on this slate where is where's the first place you turn we can stick with Nick Richards honestly I mean he you know with with Williams out Richards will be an option he's been kind of frustrating on the DFS side because not not a ton of production even in the most I mean he started two or three games in a row now maybe four and he seen some minutes most recent game you had PJ Washington leave early because of an injury and PJ Washington is questionable for night for tonight as well so that's something to keep an eye on but in that game without William's and with Washington leaving early Nick Richards played 40 minutes  if he if he sees anything close to that tonight then he'll be very hard for him not to return value for a DFS slate he's at 5400 on DraftKings and 5400 on FanDuel as well it was nice he gets blocks he gets rebounds it's kind of a matter of is he getting a score enough which he hasn't been doing a ton of 6 points in each of the past two games but at 5400 there is upside where like he's going to put it all together C30 plus minutes get a double-double with a couple blocks and provide solid value so he's one of my favorite big Mendota Target for tonight's slate is there is there anything you could tell us about this Pistons 76ers game Shannon or is this just it's just sad hey  all right I will risk my job  to talk more Pistons it's okay I can do that so I one of my one of my key DFS strategies over the past couple weeks where I've been on a nice little run has been targeting  whoever the lead guard is or one of the lead guards against the Detroit Pistons we mentioned this last week as well you know the you look at past performance is of weed guards or high scoring guards just going off against pistons and racking up 50 or 60 fantasy points that continued earlier this week I believe it was on Monday night when Ben mathurin had a giant game against the Pistons tonight you've got Maxi going against Detroit Maxi this is actually the second game in a row that Philadelphia has gone against Detroit and Maxi put up a dud last time earlier this week I on Wednesday he only had 26 fantasy points might have been his worst game of the season but it's because they aren't really need him to do much which is always a risk when you're playing a targeting a player against the Pistons blow out but earlier this season Maxi against the Pistons had 64 fantasy points yeah one of his two or three biggest nights of the year so I still like Maxi and I actually like him as a so I think there's going to be low ownership there was on Wednesday I don't think it's gonna go up tonight because the blowout potential but Maxi could easily put together and have a giant game he's under 9,000 dollars on FanDuel right now which is pretty affordable for him keeping with some of those like higher higher priced players salary players we talked about when be earlier Wendy's just been on such an absolute tear averaging over 60 fantasy points for game over his past three he plays the Lakers he just had a big game against them you know 70.6 fantasy points his price is going up and eighty not not 100% healthy right correct well I mean 80 could get a night off will Brian got the night off against him against the Spurs early this week I don't know ads had a questionable take for like six years now you know basically join the Lakers so I don't whether he's healthy or not I don't know but I do  like I like Victor Wendy even though he's going up in price another high price option Triple J triple hard Jared Jackson Jr he is he is also been on a tear another big man just racking up blocks treating Ken and I good and our NFC nfb Casey team back to back games with 40 or more points that's not fantasy points like actual points he had 41 points against Dallas 44 against the Rockets he got a rematch against the Rockets tonight 8900 on FanDuel give me some give me some triple hard J  obviously like that more Desmond Bane is out yeah absolutely you know they funnel offense through and Jackson a little bit more is there anything Ken that you can tell us about this the Celtics Magic game  only that the magic of won the last three games against the Celtics ever since Eddie House called the magic so the about this time last year was the 16th of December last year magic upset Boston tonight I think in Boston and Eddie House post game said Adam the magic are still trash and the magic players actually said they saw that and motivates the for every other Celtic game in there yeah they got a four-game winning streak against the Celtics a Salt Lake played last night looked really good beating the Cavs twice but they you know they struggle with the high scoring forwards of the magic and I'm a little a little curious to see how much Brown and Tatum are going to have in the tank to play defense tonight against Wagner and Pablo so I Wouldn't Mind Investing in some magic forwards tonight if the price is right yeah Boston only 6 point home favorites on the second night of a back-to-back despite not losing a home game all season so that is  interesting Note One game I don't think we've touched on but it's probably a massive over under that's what I'm that's where I'm going yeah 259 right now is the over under between Pacers at Wizards and this is a game or Jordan Poole is a game time call and probably the spread will move in the Wizards favor if he's out I'm not even really kidding he has the worst Advanced stats in the league by a mile and he's got terrible normal stats too it's not only shocked are you are is this a game sharing and where you know you have your specific guys that you're targeting right that you just talked about is this a good game to just fill in you know you got a little extra money remaining all the options kind of see me even but it's like this game might go you know 125 129 I just fill it in a little Bruce Brown a little of the lineup yeah I mean one it's no surprise that the Pacers game's highest over under in the night that's going to be the case every single slate that they're involved in they you know as of Monday night I forget I don't know I don't know what's happened since then but they were they were the highest scoring team in the NBA history on a per game basis through through Monday night's game  and they play no defense as well so you always know they're opposing teams going to score tan this could be the craziest Halliburton game except could be a blowout by the third quarter which case they'd be smart to a bunch of so that's the fear yeah the fear is the blowout potential of course and and with Halliburton like blow up potential with Halliburton is riskier than a guy like Maxi in my opinion because Halliburton on DraftKings he's the second most expensive player on the Slate I mean he costs nine hundred dollars more than Booker 1200 more than Tatum over 24 2500 more 2400 more than Maxi so I mean Helper and it's obviously been great but if I'm spending up I on that I'm just gonna go get him beat or I'm going to get Lucas or be over Midway in the third yes yes McConnell come on out just to help finish the game yeah I I think allocating some of that salary cap to a guy like Wendy on tonight's late makes more sense than it does however but that's not to say there aren't players to Target in that game I mentioned Ben math earlier he's still pretty affordable really up and down risky play because he's coming off the  bench you never know if he's gonna play 35 or 35 or if the shots falling that night you know I had 55 points against Pistons 55 fantasy points against Pistons fall that up with 15 fancy points so there is risk there but he's 6,000 on fan to our on DraftKings in that same range a little bit cheaper on 52 on FanDuel one guy that you mentioned now that if he plays I actually like them in this matchup it's Jordan Poole because I feel like this is one of those games where you have the highest over under the night you know his team could easily score 130 so like Ken's boy kuzmin and Jordan Poole both solid options their guns you know they're gonna be out there fire in for tonight with how about this though if pools out  could be monster minutes for the rookie  we'll all cool a bali whose name I probably just pronounce mispronounced but he's had a nice little run the last five  yeah and he's probably only it might be the only person on this roster we see two or three years now on the Wizards I could see him having a nice night yeah 5600 on FanDuel he's he's had some solid games I agree I think he he's a solid option as well let's let's move on to Ken's old man Ranch since he has a heart out he's beating some old other old men for for brunch or something like  I don't remember exactly what he said but he  starting January 11th online sports betting will be legal
