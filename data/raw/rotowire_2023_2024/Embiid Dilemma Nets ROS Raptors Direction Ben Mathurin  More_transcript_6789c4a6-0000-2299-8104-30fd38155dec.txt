was one of those friends I was speaking you know but now that I've talked to her this morning we figured out or I figured out that we have met before we have talked Hoops but Carla I hear that you know a lot about basketball on your fired up to talk some fancy with these people well I a thank you that's great to speak with you I know at least a little bit about basketball I'm definitely very enthusiastic about it love talking Hoops love watching hoops and much respect for you know you doc a great person to talk with and  absolutely before we before we kick off I do have a question for you

induction ceremony just want to congratulate you again because that's my blowing so cool thrilled for you much deserved you know recognition into the fantasy sports writers association Hall of Fame  and for those of us like us all who do you know who are fans of not just Hoops but but love to talk loved us all coops with you know other fun folks could you tell us for those of us who love the pop how we could watch this ceremony is yeah well it's really not it's really not gonna be a ceremony so much I didn't really know what it was gonna be I think okay what would it be is 15 minutes of Q&A with me and the guys on the Sirius XM fantasy sports channel which I think is 87 I don't have a subscription to that myself I'm hoping they will package up whatever we do and send it to me and I can share it but yeah it's yeah I don't even know the exact time it's happening yet okay it'll be between 1 and 3:00 tomorrow on the fancy Sports  channel on Sirius XM but you know it is a it is quite an honor I am pretty fired up about it and some of my friends around the air like oh I've never heard of the fantasy sports writers Hall of Fame I didn't know there was such a thing but they also know that you know any Hall of Fame you get into is pretty pretty it's not for doing something gross is pretty cool so I'm pretty tired a whole of Fame I mean yeah that's thrilling and I'm pretty fired up about it and and I do remember you by the way I did not forget all about you our friend Bob did not mention to me that we had actually met before so it right right right right and he mentioned that I think I may have I may have done a better job with this whole thing but  anyway thank you for the kind words I'm pretty excited about it oh absolutely absolutely it was with good reason too  I got a good one let's let's dive into what happened well let's dive into some of the stuff that's going on in fantasy Hoops are now like fantasy I got a call last night from a guy I'm on this this app called did it and people can call me and for like  I don't know it's like a dollar a minute or a dollar every two minutes or something they can talk to me on the phone video and show me their team and I can give them advice as to what to do with their team and it's been very slow I have not got I've gotten a lot of messages but then when you tell people they got a call and pay they're like well I'm not doing that I can just hit you on Twitter whatever and I'm okay I answer a lot of stuff on Twitter I write a mail back on whatnot this dude Max calls me last night and he's like I'm in a dynasty League dude and I've got Joel and bead and just I've got this crazy great trade-off on the table where a guy wants to give me all this stuff for Joel OMB but I just don't I don't want to be the come back before the season regular season ends and ruin my  ruin my years so do you have  any thoughts on if or when Joel I'm is gonna play again in the regular season  and it looks like  I mean we're not we're not doctors like we did we nobody knows right I know that he wants to get back a of course  I know that  I mean I know that Nick nurse was it okay let's go with this if you had a fantasy basketball team like do you think do you think Joel embiid is gonna play before the playoffs yes or no  yes but  not enough that it's going to take your season if you let go of them so not enough it's gonna help you not enough but it's gonna help you okay and I'm I'm on the same boat there I think indeed could come back with like a week left in the regular season exactly he met two weeks stops he I don't think it'll be too but it could be but I think you'll be like a week I think he'll play like in three or four games they'll try to get him at least a little ramped up for the for the playoff push but I can't see them bringing him back early enough that if you have him on your fancy team that he's gonna help you win a championship there is a chance of you if your league plays in that like last 10 day window of the regular season maybe he has a big game or two but I just I don't see it I mean the thing I'm I'm doing with him is just keeping him stashed on the injured list and if he plays I'll activate him if he doesn't let him sit there and it just is what it  is so um but I don't think most I think most fantasy owners that have Joe Ellen beat on their team aren't gonna have to make a decision you just leave him on your hour but this kid this kid had this big trade offer and it included like three draft picks and three players and one of them was Jaron Jackson Jr and I was like Jordan need to do that because Joe L&B just hurt every single year  he's not as good as we think he is because he's never  he's never gonna play a full season he did last year for the most part this year this year and every other season he just can't he can't finish and a lot of people in Philadelphia like do we really want to rest all of our  future hopes on Joel embiid who can never stay healthy so  I don't know I think you got to look at you know the same way from a fantasy  perspective as well  I wholeheartedly agree that you know I mean yeah when you're a fancy GM you've got to think like you know regular jeans  and playing ads for the future and I you're absolutely I mean Joel embiid is  you know if he's healthy he's hands down you know my would be my vote for MVP oh he was the MVP till he was you know as per usual absolutely incredible even  I mean even even  more so than last year you know I mean  did you steal Bob's RotoWire hat  I am borrowing it  oh boiling it okay I was just checking if you did you did you borrow his Tumblr as well but thanks for noticing no I did not I'm actually I'm drinking out of my my Miami Heat  bottle this big ass cup but yeah I got the big water bottle okay all right okay so Trey young is the other guy that's messing up all these fantasy managers right now because finger surgery and you were there you and Bob the standards were at the game on was it Sunday yes Sunday and traded did not played the Shantae kind of went off  B tell me about your experience of the game briefly briefly and then when do you think Trey is coming back this one's a little easier because we know he's he's out a month but it's still up in the air right the well the Hawks game was pretty sure I think they look like a real basketball team now which is incredible they play on both ends I love seeing that I am a huge Dante fan all always love to see him play have only caught maybe five four five home games this year oh one of which was the  November game versus the Pacers that you know the records setting scoring game which was yeah which was you know awesome on every level and that we're actually joking about that in the first quarter that  because it you know it started out so slow against the magic and you know Paula Ben Carroll was a plank obviously Trey Wilson play so it's seemed like my you know kind of interesting matchups something that all the arguably you know two teams best players both up started out slow but turn it to what was a I mean a great show and buy the Hawks and a pretty good game overall Jalen Johnson's pretty good didn't he Jalen Johnson is pretty good and you know I had not seen Kobe Bumpkin play  and you know I had not seen him play in person until the other night which I enjoyed seeing he didn't do anything spectacular what or even you know really remarkable but both he got him started and then wow man yeah Jalen Johnson  so great so the crazy thing about Trey young going down is usually when a superstar gets hurt there's a guy that you want to run to the waiver wire and pick up that's gonna fill in for that player and with Trey young they're really isn't that guy maybe it's Bowie by Donna of it I think that's as close as you're going to get because Deonte is just gonna take over a point guard and everybody else kind of slides in but it is a weird it is a weird thing when I want to start gets hurt and there's nobody to pick up but okay so he's supposed to miss a month he's coming back like late March early April do you foresee him making an impact in those last two weeks  I I  don't have tanking um  I may I may be a mistaken but  I think I  I wouldn't get rid of them I think he'll I think I'll put up  I think like all depends on when your league ends because exactly exactly is over on March 31st or April 3rd I think you can probably let trade go if you really goes through the end of the year  the Hawks may not intentionally be ready to tank but are they going to make the playoffs I mean it's pretty close and I don't know thinking can do it without Trey I mean they're currently the number 10 seed you've got Brooklyn and Toronto coming behind them you've got the Bulls a couple games in front of them I I don't think  it's right I think by the time trays out a month the Hawks are going to be like you know what it's it's over this year is a lost cause maybe they you're that you're in good company with that opinion I mean there's there's lots of folks who  believe that's exactly how it'll play out I think it very well played out exactly like that but I'm hoping for a slower trajectory to that point  yes I mean I mean  really though in reality of the Hawks get in the play in tournament  they're going to get bounced in the first or second round and then they're gonna get a crappy draft pick as usual and right I just rather I would just rather they pack it in I mean we we don't have a condo we don't have tray  I I just like watching Jalen play I only went to one Hawks game this year and it was the it was the Luca but bananza oh  one yeah you're one showing that's fantastic that was the right one to go to I think oh man so I'm a lucky guy oh yeah I  I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't be  what oh go ahead sorry oh one thing interesting the brunette Fernando  you know taking a congress right he he did a nice job  yeah I was curious why a cappella only played like 17 minutes in the game  uh I think probably just limiting his minutes because coming back from injury I think I think it was basically just an issue of managing his minutes then that could be it could be Bruno Fernandes season yeah I think yeah I think  I think it could be actually  talking about the handful of games that I have lost their jobs I may actually go we may try to catch the Jazz at Hawks tonight because you know  just see if I can get any cheapest ticket  you know later this afternoon because I'm pretty big game for both teams and you know reality and fantasy um yeah the Jazz are interesting they're  they're right on the fence they're 11 they're three they're three games behind the word it's not looking good for them Dallas is streaking kings are good Lakers are Lakers and Warriors are both better than the Jazz I feel like the Jazz are on the verge of like  maybe starting to take it take their foot off the gas and letting some guys play but they're only three games out of the play I mean getting some guys some nights off like Laurie marketing is usually  shut down by this point of the season I can't figure out what that  can't figure out what that team is doing with Walker Kessler and why  he's not playing big minutes I am excited about keyonte George thrust away though because he's they're gonna play him the rest away so yeah me fun to see him play Live first for sure another it was it was really good to see Joshua Hunter you know back from injury and in good for him and I do actually I hope that he continues that for the rest of the season if you know I mean he'll be playing  yeah but I'm in court that we need to get rid of one of those guys you know like saddiq Bey or DeAndre Hunter needs to go I want to see Jalen Allen all the time  I  all right so Trey coming back I don't really matter I think um I'm trying to have him removed from the Yahoo do not cut list of talk through a couple people I don't know that's been done or not yet but you know in some fancy leads you can't cut right sure but once they get hurt we take him off that list so I'm hopefully we gets taken off that list cuz you know people don't need that roster flexibility at this time of year so let's talk now when it's trying to make this quick because we only got about  we only got about 45 minutes for this whole thing Jaron Jackson Jr  Memphis  Desmond Maine Gone John the team is terrible that game last night was they were they were horrific basically GG Jackson was  when they say he was one of  13 one of 13 shooting that's not good is Jaron Jackson Jr going to keep going out there and busting his butt for this team that is  20 and a half games out of first place  and seems utterly and saying to me for them to  you know keep them out there playing hard in  meaningless games  yes that know what is it is he going to continue playing I mean are they going to shut him down they should shut down they should shut him down are they gonna shut him down however you know  not just yet but I feel like at any at any point  I I'm anticipated it of course you know that's what I'm saying it's a man I'm saying he gonna get shut down for a while and it hasn't happened yet I'm a little surprised it hasn't happened yet um I think it's coming he's coming and we're we're then we're on exactly the same page yeah I I think it's coming don't know when it's already February 27th it's I think it's gonna happen by  March 25th and if I had to pick a date I would go with March March 17th sounds about right March 17th is one of mysterious back injuries going to sideline Jaron Jackson Jr that is my prediction but you know I've been telling people to trade Janet Jackson Jr now for a month and it it hasn't really worked out  if you did it unless you somebody who's really good  right I mean well  obviously Lamar Stevens if you  you know  if you don't have  pick him up if that's an option  you like Lamar Stevens  he's gonna see he's gonna see some more playing time he played well last night let's talk about that he led the Grizzlies with 17 points he hit eight out of nine field goals Lamar Stevens now generally I would not go tell people to pick up Lamar Stevens I would not tell people to go pick up Lamar Stevens but in this he's a baller  but in this in this um  Silly Season that we're getting right around with and the fact that Memphis  is already running with a g-league team yes indeed they are like Lamar Stevens might make  sense I have not looked at his game log I just know  I know we got hot last night and he played well last time but you know GG Jackson gets hot in place well every other game as well but then he he doesn't he's like he does last night where it's one of one of 13 shots or whatever  I don't know I don't I don't know Vince Williams was a great call I think to pick up for them I just don't know  if Lamar Stevens is gonna be the guy let's look at his game log I need to pull that up because  if he's been doing this a lot and I'm in sleeping on him yeah double figures in four of his last five so  rebounds blocks yeah and all in very limited minutes if they shut down Jared Jackson Jr Carly exactly Lamar Stevens will be a pickup  exactly someone to look at you know  it's not a bad call I like right on what else happened with the that game last night we had  the Mars Stevens led the Grizzlies  and everybody else in the Grizzlies was terrible Jaron Jackson Jr hit two at 12 shops  Luke Kennard had 11 points Gigi Jackson it one of 13 Vince and zayer Williams didn't do anything that's blue them out of the gym  interesting note that Dennis Schroder started over Ben Simmons  I think the big story from the Nets game was cam Thomas  was when the sprained right ankle  had to carry off the court  they play three more games this week they play five games next week this is all very bad news for cam Thomas and His managers and as a cam Thomas manager in a 30 Team league it's a specialty  specialty painful oh  Dorian Dorian finney-smith  had 13 points and nine boards last night  and is a guy I think it's special with that five game week coming up much like Lamar Stevens who doesn't have a 5 game week but Dorian Finney Smith is a sleeper sleepy rebounder kind of forward to look up right now absolutely  um  jakka Turtle got hurt last night  yes he did he's the center for the Raptors and  when I mentioned Kelly Olynyk to Bob last week when Bob was on he's like I don't really care about Atlantic I don't eat he doesn't move my needle and  sure enough Olympic did not do anything for the rest of the week which was fine I mean I don't only one was running out to pick a lineup anyway but sure enough he actually did pick him up oh he did so now he's mad at me now he's not mad at you oh yeah I'm sure he is but now that if pearls down and Pearl's Gonna Miss time then Olynyk is going to play exactly that is something we need to keep an eye on we don't know it could just be a day-to-day thing at this point I'm much much more worried about cam Thomas's injury than I am yakim pearls but at least it's a guy to keep an eye on and then  um  props to Scotty Barnes 212 boards 12 assists five blocks stupid and then she I mean yeah get out of here great He did apparently plays well on Mondays you know 18 points with four triples I think he did that last Monday as well before Bob and I were on and both of us were like no we're not falling we're not falling for the gradey dick trap but  then of course Pascal siakam  played in his former team as he we knew he would and then this math and Cat for the Pacers I love man I love the game so much and he's been possibly the most frustrating fantasy player  in the league this year because he he does stuff like he did last night which is 34 points nine boards five assists  two steals a block and five three-pointers but then it'll turn around the next game and have 12 points and three rebounds and one assist and it's just like why can't he do this consistently for for a team to score so many points and I don't really have an answer for it it's just been frustrating say it's it's yeah it's feast  or fatigue that  has a lot of  but he's yeah he's definitely  yeah you can't expect consistency  you have not been able to I thought when I thought when they sent buddy hield to fill you and Buddy hield started going off in Philly that I was gonna be math and season he was going to start right doing this all the time and last night was awesome I just hope it keeps going out part of the reason he did well last night it's probably because Tyrese Albert and took the night off on two 11 shooting with 9.7 assists that was not what I was looking for my FanDuel lineup that cost me money whatever Myles Turner's been playing really well had a really big game on Saturday or Sunday one of those and then he had 1611 with two blocks last night so that was cool  but yeah um  yeah I just don't know why I'm answering can't do that every night I think my husband's gonna be a lot of people are gonna pick him up after last night  and yeah he's going to score 12 points with three rebounds I mean why didn't I do that  um  Zion Williamson is if he for Tuesday do the left foot contusion CJ McCollum is  questionable with ankle injury Jose Alvarado is suspended those are all New Orleans Pelicans so if all of them are out right I guess it's herb Jones and Jordan Hawkins and Larry Nance time yeah exactly  yeah and I actually learning he looked he looked good other night again the Heat and the in the Menace he got then  so you know  learning answers another one of those guys like oh he's an option who you know deserves a look oh Larry Nance is gonna play I'm just so excited about this and then he doesn't really do anything and then you know Zion will be playing a game and then all of a sudden Larry and so I have a good game like just kind of all over the place Jordan Harvey haven't been there to Herb Jones was really good without CJ and Alvarado  on Sunday I think it was something I um so I'm kind of intrigued by herb Jones he's already rostered most mostly mostly yeah mostly  um let's talk about that Nick's Pistons finish did you get see that  whoa yeah I did and I you know what do you think well tell the people what happened  well  it was what their five seconds left  Josh Josh Hart well he's even though did what he dove into austere times like I mean it looked like if I look like a football game  it was a tax try to take out his knees yeah it was a tackle it was a no-call and it was absolutely  horrific it was a horrific mythical like officiating yeah it was really bad missed call and then that ended up getting the ball into Json Hart's hands and he hit a kind of a hanging  layup Fade Away lay up basically to win the game  and  Jason Hart went off last night and 23 points 66  33 pointers of Steel and block and Monty Williams lost it in oh man press conference  he didn't lose it to the level that the Raptors coach lost it when he was talking about Scotty Barnes needing respect what even play the game why play the game that was my favorite coach rant this year but  this was pretty close because he basically just got up there and he was like  it's not fair we've been fighting it all year I'm sick and telling my guys that I've done everything I can do but it's not enough and then the official I have to the game admits that he missed the call which I don't know how he couldn't admit that because yeah  it was just it was just it was just stupid I don't understand  um I understand giving the veterans and the good teams and the  people who have earned it a little leeway when it comes that but I don't yes I don't understand is totally disrespecting these other guys they're out there playing and trying to trying to get a job  though absolutely I when and that the post game I was just like  oh Monty Williams like they yes sir yes sir that was that was wild it was horrible and  so glad he spoke up for his players and yeah I mean obviously the ref said  I was wrong when he just got up and walked away which I thought was pretty cool  and so yeah that's all I have to say because that  the needed to be said  how did the Kings lose it home to a heat Team Missing Jimmy Butler Tyler hero anterior Rosier and Josh Richardson  Point leading that game which they blew and the King all the way  all the way back and looked like the kings were  set to take it and then I talked to me I mean wow what what  here's here's a little secret  that he they really are that deep  they really are that deep thought I mean  it's  obviously bam  another hi guys was the the hero of that game hi guys was Heroes that game and  as  you may or call from my pre-season notes and texts  I  was so excited about the heat dropping about the heat drafting how I was a huge fan of hers at UCLA he's just you know  crazy crazy fundamentals super high motor guy and just you know clearly someone who impacts winning so I've been high on him for years and I'm thrilled that he is you know doing his thing in the NBA like on a trajectory that even I be you know a huge fan of his  could not have projected what a game he had last night and Delon Wright as well you know the new pickup it was fantastic I mean how many  between them what like Delano 13 points five assists a couple Steals on block and then how does hockey is just he's just blown me away all year because he doesn't look like a rookie and you can tell the players and coach  loves Hawkins he's actually a big piece of what they do it's so many clutch shots last night he was 12 or 17 um and then Kevin Love comes off the bench for 15 minutes 19 points with seven boards which that was weird  and Duncan Robinson who was supposed to go off because  Jimmy and Rosier and hero were all out it's one of 11 shots and yet they still win and he has 11 assists so 11 yeah exactly it's a weird a weird night we love it we have absolutely loved it they I mean wow the heat what a strange that the and of course that their season  I mean the  January slump was you know that it coincided with  with an injury of a rookie you know but they did they had I mean that slump did go and slide with  with Jaime's groin injury and  I he's back you know and it looks like they're back what they're on a I guess seven game and they've won five yeah I think I think that was a fourth straight win okay  um but yeah and I think I I wish we could see Jaime Hawkeyes out there without Jimmy Butler and without Terry Rozier all the time because I think and without Tyler here if that was the case I think we would have another  another guy fighting for this Rookie of the Year with with women oh absolutely like I mean  yeah  he has no chance with one being in the Home Run doing what to do and I'm not sure anyone has a chance over when be at this point but let me sort of taking off and last couple weeks  so hopefully they just keep playing him for the Kings last night sabonis had another hoe home triple-double was like 90 or something ridiculous but Murray Murray not Lamar Murray you Lord Keegan Murray look really good and a 14 shots 28.6 triples three steals two blocks I mean that's a line and then deer and fox played pretty well seven turnovers was kind of a killer but Malik monk leaked monk was a little quiet last night for my life yeah surprisingly so  um if you guys are out there  and there are some of you out there I can see you and want to ask a question of me or us feel free to throw it in the comments we'll dive in there get to it let me backtrack here and figure out what I forgot scoot Henderson is driving me nuts right now oh this three games in a row  he's got an abductor he's not gonna play tonight  might play on Friday  I'm just like  do I drop him do I keep him I think I dropped him finally last night and just picked somebody else up because  I don't have time to sit around and wait for marginal players to come back and  finally Grace my team for one or two games a week  so I cut Henderson I feel pretty good about it  he's about that  I love it DOC great call thanks yeah I love it too um  what are your thoughts on Ben Simmons  oh just in general  first word that comes to my mind is just fraught  I'm glad he's not on my roster I  he's  certainly can play basketball well  I don't  he can play basketball well but can you see it we know that is still he can play basketball well but I wouldn't necessarily um  want to rely on him to do that well my take on Benson is he wanted to be the number one draft pick he wasn't a one draft pick any sort of stopped trying at that point I don't know why I don't know how I don't know what is going on even now with his new team and everything I mean the fact that we're starting Dennis Schroder and letting Dennis Schroder go off for 18 points 5 assists and you've got been Simmons out there doing his single triple thing it's just it's weird triple single it's I just I'm not taking the bait now in the Nets do play five games next week which is in Fantasy is a big deal of course yeah  but even then I mean if Ben Simmons plays  in three of those games it'll be a minor miracle mm-hmm all right Matt Carmody says that he does not believe Joel embed is coming back in time to be fantasy relevant I think Carly and I are with you on that mat that is a good call  Christian says should I trade away and Anthony Simons do you think he will get shut down  now that's Dean that's interesting because that he plays for the Blazers and hurt our guy Malcolm Brogdon is out with a timetable to return the only guy they have to play  point guard I guess is what amphi Simon's is doing is Anthony Simons right now and  that makes me a little leery to trade away Anfernee Simons  card you have any thoughts on Anthony Simons  I  I wouldn't trade him away  that's okay I mean that  if you're asking me just straight up yes or no like no I would not saying okay well looking at the Portland depth chart  we've got scoot Henderson out Malcolm Brogden out Anfernee Simons in like he's literally the only guy unless they want to play this cat named the Longbow Banton which I don't think anybody's really counting on that happening well I mean now happened down the stretch because Portland is going to be tanking and silly seasoning it up just as much as anybody because they have what like 15 wins on the season but I think you hang on to Simon's at least until school is back maybe scoot comes back on Friday then I'm okay with it but as now they have nobody else to play except for Simon so I think I think I'm hanging on for to Simon's until I either see scoot or brought them back on the court but  again they made they may just cash it all in and just played five big men in the rest of it because it really doesn't matter  um what else we got anybody else got a question anybody got anything  um  anything else we need to talk about there's a lot of games happening tonight  we have a Full Slate of NBA action coming out of us  on Tuesday night and it's actually one two three four five  11 games so 22 teams  in action you got Luca at Cleveland  you've got the Jazz at Atlanta and maybe you and Bobby will be at that game  six of us at Boston is a big one that is on TNT 730 you've got wimby against Ant-Man and Minnesota that will be fun you've got  the other big one I guess is Houston and Oklahoma City but it ain't that big Oklahoma City's good Houston's Okay Oklahoma City should roll them  Oklahoma City so fun to watch on TV though I love watching this oh man hungry and  Josh Gideon and that whole damn well Williams Oh man Jalen's awesome  look oh yeah love him of course questions are rolling in trying a couple other ones here  Michael Chang the famous tennis player from back in my day  thoughts on Kelly Olynyk after the poodle injury yep we talked about that I think  Helio Linux gonna be a Thing If Turtles games that Atlantic Olympics good he hits threes he rebounds he scores he can block his shot  I don't know these like a run don't walk add to your roster right now but he's at least a guy where portals gonna miss four games you know that Kelly and he's gonna  kind of come through a new something  we have not talked about Jordan Poole today so literally the most disappointing player in the league in my opinion on this season yeah  um Jordan Poole production Off the Bench is it fake will he get shut down that's from when you are ready  I don't even know at this point dude I've sort of written Jordan Poole off  but  I have noticed he's had a 30-point game here he's had a 25-point game there he's like playing better I sits in one of my Dynasty rosters somewhere doing something but man what a horrible year horrible year he's had  I was one of those idiots that thought Jordan Poole had a chance to lead the league in scoring at South  how dumb I am  do you have any thoughts on Jordan Poole  31 218 19  last four games oh good I mean those numbers like great I you try to yeah I mean I would I try to avoid Jordan Poole just as a matter of principle those those numbers sound great I would love you know I would love to have those numbers well he got helped the last game because coolah they've started Kula Bali in front of him cool about we got hurt  so then Jordan Poole played 38 minutes scored 31 points but even before that he's been getting minutes in the 30s I I don't understand why Washington is most she has nine wins this season  these minutes of these guys are Marvin Bagley gets 33 minutes Kyle's gets 39 highest Jones  35 Landry she met 37  Jordan Poole 308 like and they lost by 9 points I don't understand why we are  like why they haven't just shut that whole team down and made it one big silly season and I don't understand why they haven't shut that team down either  nine wins  so yeah when you ready it's it seems fake in it but it  I I don't know I don't know what they're doing and cool about getting hurt really helped Jordan Poole in that last one but  I don't know if I don't know if Washington is going to shut guys down or not I they have to at some point  so yeah I mean this may be the ultimate sell High moment on Jordan Poole that we've seen in the history of Jordan pools career so  that  with that we are at the end of our time I need to go up no we're gonna do one more when you ready one ready he's got a heart and I was like talking about heart and Stone  got dropped on the Waze 14 team  oh when the Carter Jr would you drop window cards Junior to pick up hartstein  when you are ready I think I would do that I would rather have a heart in Stein  Carli your thoughts  I love heart inside  and looking I just think hartenstein with with  with what's going on with New York how many minutes there guys get every night we're not afraid to run a New York Knick into the ground and  break his body because that's what we do that's what Tom tip of the dividend does so I kind of like the hardest time aspect of this no he didn't he didn't go off last night but he  put some you know decent fantasy stats but I do like  the season that heart and Steins had and I think I'd rather him than when car Junior agree solid exciting yeah that solid  okay with that the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast is coming to an end I will be back on
