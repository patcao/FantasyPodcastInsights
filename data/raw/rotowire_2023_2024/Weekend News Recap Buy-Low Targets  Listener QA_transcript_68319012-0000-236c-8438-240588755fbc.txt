welcome to a Monday edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast as our French reloj ask where are these turkeys 12 means 12 Alex so I think we're like 30 seconds later than we said we'd be starting so we were underway we thank everybody who listens to us live you could watch on YouTube you could watch on Twitter obviously you could consume this as a traditional podcast as well wherever you get your podcast we're gonna recap all of our takeaways from a big weekend in the NBA we'll talk about some players to potentially Buy Low on guys might want to sell high on but now we're still early enough in the season where I maybe maybe it's just because I'm a wuss and I don't like to take risks this early on but like I still like waiting things out you know like Pascal I'm not quite panicking on had a couple good games came back down to Earth last time out you know how aggressive do you tend to be early in the season when we're talking eight nine ten games in as far as adjusting your roster goes it depends I mean you know there are a few guys on my teams that I just like dropped or have been trying to drop right away but most of those have been complete Flyers like Colin Sexton and guys like that you know we got some interesting questions on the Friday podcast like Jabari Smith Jr was kind of a point of contention I was like jabari's Drop in a tent is a 10 Team league I was like you shouldn't worry about dropping him I don't think it's gonna come back to bite you Shannon felt the opposite so it's more so guys like that it really just kind of depends on if you think they're production  if it's like a field goal percentage issue a lot at a time or like a minute issue rather than some other thing that's going on yeah the the field goal percentage of something that's that's me early on in a couple of weeks you know someone like lamelo ball it's got off to a really rough start shooting it he's already started to come around you know ironically Damian Lillard is kind of killing me in in our stake League one of our staff leaks so far the assists have been down he's been just terrible for three still hovering around 40% so it hasn't been a complete disaster but yeah I think you're right to point that out that free throw percentage vehicle percentage those two can have the the biggest variants early on but we'll go right to a few questions here we'll try to kind of check in on the chat throughout then you know open it up for more of a full Q&A later but we have a question from Dost Vista Ski I wonder how many games Brogden will miss could it only be one he dropped frogged in for Skylar Mays and he says he hopes he will not regret it what are your thoughts on on that decision we raise you know he has some opportunities at the end of last season in Portland and you know whatever the minutes have been there he's usually been pretty productive but you know there's a  reason not only about scoot Henderson for for why he's playing those minutes yeah I mean I I don't know if you'll regret it because you like Nick mentioned scoot is going to be out for maybe another two weeks and so I won't be surprised if Mae's continues to see 30 minutes a game you know Brogden plays a little shooting guard sharp moves up just because Portland's depth is so there's that this is horrible you know it's a lot of too many tomorrow it's a lot of Jabari Walker um so  and I think the important thing to remember about Brogden  well there's two things here first Brogden it's a hamstring injury and those are notoriously hard to come back from they have a really high re-injury rate we know Brogan's had leg issues in the past in terms of his durability so I won't be surprised if he's out for at least another week even though they're taking it day to day it's somebody mentioned yeah we were talking about Jabari Smith Clarence says he's dropped Jabari everywhere mostly to pick up the Lal Kula Bali from the Washington Wizards I'm with you Alex where I feel I don't think it's like completely out of the question that Jabari Smith could come on later in the season and we saw him play better at the end of last year as well but we got enough of a sample man where even even like his plus games have just not even been great Fantasy games right like yeah he had 21 in 11 against the Kings but you know really not doing anything defensively like the blocks of that because consistent the steals have been even less consistent he's giving you almost nothing as a passer we kind of do that would be the case he was 1.3 assists last season but there's been no jump there whatsoever the field goal percentage is better you shoot a better from three up closer to two main threes for games so that's that's something that you can say is maybe a feather it is Cap but he's also shooting 55% on very limited attempts from the field and I just don't know if that changes with the direction that he's used to going like I don't think this is a team that wants to change anything right now with his hot as they Bend of  late where do you come in on coolie though I had his best game as a pro over the weekend you know super super raw I think Washington kind of knew what it was getting itself into with that pick you look at the first eight games for cool Bali six and a half points 2.9 rebounds 1.5 assists 0.9 blocks but he popped for 2073 at four steals against the Nets on Sunday yeah I mean you know the Wizards are going to continue to be awful um I watched a good majority of that Nets Wizards game and like Jordan Poole was at points he was like look like the worst guy in the court and other people you gotta watch more football dude I yes I do um but they're gonna continue to be bad right so minutes are gonna be there for Kula Bali and look he's not he had the best game of his career the other night against Brooklyn I just  it's a Steals and blocks thing that's why you're picking up cool about Bali because if he can continue to get 25 to 30 minutes a game you could be looking at two combined Steals and blocks you know and then you're looking at something interesting but he's just a really wrong offensive player they have other guys with usage so  to be honest I won't be surprised if you end up dropping cooler Bali like you dropped Jabari Smith Jr but I understand why you might make that change  here's an interesting one now Alex from from bee baller and I feel like we've got more keyonte George questions across all platforms this year then just about anybody else would you drop Kobe white to pick up keyonte George and which of those two as a better outlook for the rest of the season I would keep Kobe white he's having a  he had a slow start to the season but now he's picked things up he's shooting a bit better my you know my only  my only hesitation in terms of picking white over keyonte George is I think George has a higher assists  ceiling and floor he's he's proven to be a more he's controlling the offense a lot more in Utah than Kobe white is in Chicago so if you really need assists  I think you can lean keyonte George but if you're just looking if you're just talking like General value if you're in a points league if you just need like Roto scoring in general I would lean Kobe white because I do worry about cancer George's field goal percentage his lack of defensive stats so far not that Kobe White's you know averaging like two steals game or anything yeah I feel like there's some there's some like Talent Horton Tucker Vibes with keyonte George which could be good or bad you know it's special when the way we talked about Talen Horton Tucker earlier in his career you know like you see the flashes like the good games the good possessions are really good but overall I still don't think it's an overly friendly fantasy profile like if you're if you're chasing a specifically then sure go grab key out to George but you know he's shot five of 20 from the field and one of nine from three over his last two games he's not not a high free throw rate guy for friends athletic and young as he is like the steals haven't really been there he's already he's not gonna block a ton of shots the rebounding is not great so I get the appeal with George I you know there could be a two or three weeks stretch like later in the season where he really comes on but I have not really found myself like rushing to the waiver wire to add him anyway well and he I mean the shooting concerns me partially because you was really inefficient in college if this was like oh he's just kind of shooting poorly to start the year he's getting used to MP  a competition he shot 38% from the field and 34% from three or from three in college and it's weird though because he only averaged three assists and now he's a much better passer in the NBA he's kind of a confounding player yeah but yeah it kind of depends on your format I want to ask you about Spencer Dinwiddie Alex I believe you have him rostered in our in our stake League spend a it's been a roller coaster as it always is with Spencer Dinwiddie like opening night terrible only played for 24 minutes next night he plays 40 minutes gives you 23 and 8 it's been kind of the same story up and down since then we did with you you're always gonna have to live with the the DraStic you know game to game field goal percentage variance like free throw percentage has been all over the place throughout his career hasn't been super traceable is three point shooting tends to come and go year to year really the assists are what you've been able to bank on in the past but he's down to 4.8% game so far what are you doing with you right now  so I do have him in our 16 Team league and I'm holding on to him in a 16 team her just okay he's good enough for that but if you are in a 12 week and maybe even attend Team league I think you're probably fine moving on and streaming the spot because almost any player if you're a special in your 10 Team league almost any player on the wire can give you didn't Wiggy's stats especially if they're on a four game week like if you just stream guys in on four game weeks my main concern within Woody it just he doesn't really seem to fit within their offense that well they before Lonnie Walker got hurt they were leaning on Lonnie Walker a lot Dennis Smith Jr continues to look good they have Ben Simmons they had cam Thomas available like I think did he's kind of falling by the wayside as like a 31 year old who doesn't really like fit their timeline and more of an overarching concern he has almost the lowest usage rate of his entire career right now 19% compared to last year's 27% and that's the usage rate that includes assists from cleaning the glass so I think he's a young lady I think it's fine to drop them yeah I'm with you on that and it's also worked outing that Ben Simmons has missed for the last five games and I think if anything that would open up the assist opportunities the playmaking for Dinwiddie and it's kind of gone in the opposite direction so I don't think Simmons coming back you know whenever that is should be hopefully sometime this week I don't think that is a boost if anything is probably a loss for Dinwiddie yeah I had a good question about you know which players still have a shot to break out this year and it kind of ties in with with one of our overarching themes you know kind of something to buy low players and I want to go back to the well on the Wizards we're still having the same Jordan Poole discussions Alex he ranks outside of the top 125 you're taking a loss so far if you took him at 80P in Roto League he's down to 16.4 points per game he has played 30 plus minutes in three of the last four but we're still talking 31 32 minutes that we haven't seen these like you know big 38 minute Knights for Jordan Poole even in games against Charlotte in Brooklyn that offend relatively competitive you know he hasn't taken more than 14  shots in the last three games he's not really getting to the line at all what do you do with pool  well you got a hole I mean I understand the idea of you don't want to drop it but I wouldn't blame you for trying to trade him partially because it's just I he does not The Hope was that he would come in and take you know 20 shots a game or something like that  and he in the past has I think he ranked like 55th the year that Steph Curry missed and Golden State on you know like 14 shots a game on excellent efficiency now the problem is he I don't think it's efficiency is going to improve a ton you know like last year he shot 43% from the field and 34% from three this year it's only a few percentage points lower on each and the minutes aren't there and there are a lot of times where he's just like he is disrupting their offense more than he's helping it so I will understand if you wanted to move off of him but you're selling so low that I would almost just rather hang on and just be like well maybe he can maybe this you know improves over the next month or so so kind of in the same vein you talk about guys who maybe aren't off to the greatest art but could still break out halibut KERO ranks 86th right now in eighth category per game value it doesn't feel like he's playing poorly by any means you know got off to a bit of a slow start through the first week but last five games he's got 24 and 8 with 6 assists 1.2 steals the three-point shooting I think it's what's bringing him down like you got off to a really bad start there still shooting like 30 33% from three right now that's dragging down to overall field goal percentage but 47% for the year so I think if the three-point shooting like if you think he could become a 35 36% shooter consistently decent volume which that's the other thing I can take that many he's under three steps per game he's at four last year been Carol was somebody that I was looking to look to buy relatively low on and again he's coming off of like four of his best five games of the year so maybe some people don't view it that way but if you're just if you're looking at season long breakings you know he still ranks quite a bit lower than where he was being drafted that's somebody that I really like going forward yeah I mean I'm really impressed with the the passing has looked great so far some of you know I think some of his increased stats lately have been due to Markle folks being out for for plenty of those games but at the same time you know I I think the main concerns with Ben Carroll from a like a category League rankings perspective is that he's not getting you threes his percentage as for the free throw line is is gonna harm you and he's he's not really a guy who gets defensive stats now he's at one point four steals per game he's going he's good enough of an athlete to where I I think that can I think that can stick but he's just  been Cairo is Augustine Never Gonna rank that well in Roto  just because of his free throw percentage threes and defensive issues but I think he is more valuable than that would suggest  a good question on you know our topic of all right if you're if you're done with your Barry Smith or you tried the Jordan Hawkins experiment for the last week we have a question who should I Target to replace those guys back through Spruce bug dead bug danovich or Jalen Suggs um  I think I look I'm out on Spruce being a I don't think streus is like a 12 team fantasy guy  I just I just don't think that's who he is like he has he's had some nice games for sure and I'm not trying to say that like he is not roster but if you take away those like first three games you know of of his season the numbers are a lot more muted I think the assistant really is a very good player but I I'm not convinced that he has to be rostered we kind of know who bogged on bogdanovich is he's like a guy who just consistently ranks like  80 to 100 and 20 in fantasy so I don't really like that just is what it is it's a low ceiling play songs to me is interesting just be because of the Steels upside he is one of the best defenders in the NBA especially when the best backcourt defenders in the NBA I think the steals numbers are pretty real the deflection numbers back that up but the man can I look he got hot from three over the past two games but he is a bad shooter and so you have to be prepared for it like kill your field goal percentage  so some of it depends on what you need I hate to like be wishy-washy but that's that's kind of how I feel about all those guys what I think if you're if you're looking for like somebody that I can keep on my roster for a month plus and you know just kind of write it out then maybe you lean bogged in or you lean strews because you know part of the reason that that sucks has had this uptick lately is markelle fultz has been out Gary Harris has been out we don't know how long those guys are going to be out I know folks is not going to play tomorrow night so it could be another week where you're seeing elevated minutes for Jalen Suggs but I do think at some point you know that comes back around when they get you know two of their top seven rotation guys back so if you're just looking for like the next week or two I like chasing the upside with Subs if you're looking for a longer term solution I would lean Bogdan or Max Drew's we've talked a lot in this pot outs about Scotty Barnes and you know the early season breakout that he's had if you're looking at eight cat per game value he is a first round value so far he's number 12 overall I've been on the side where I kind of want to ride this out and I know he had he had what will go down as his worst game of the year so far in that lost to Boston over the weekend 10-5-4 still at a steal and a block 45 from the field  are you in the camp outs where if you if you've profited from the Scotty Barnes breakout that you're looking to sell for a more proven asset such as Jimmy Butler or Kawhi Leonard or are you holding strong I would hold on this because he his defense of numbers are insane right now and I don't know if they're going to keep up especially the blocks but and his three-point shooting as cool off but that was to be expected but the reality is like Jimmy Butler he started the year kind of hurt  um you know hasn't like quite looked right so far and we know he's an injury risk  so and same with Kawaii right and the James Harden thing is messing up Kauai a bit  Kawaii is coming off not a great game last night against the Grizzlies oddly enough a terrible team so I I would I would hold bars because the other two guys are injury risks and their ceilings technically they're ceilings are higher than Barnes I think but Barnes are just played so well it's like I'm really starting to doubt whether Butler Kawaii their fantasy feelings are that much higher than Barnes yeah  no that's the thing I don't know if I like these two specific options like I'm not opposed to the idea of selling at Peak value on Scotty Barnes but you know Jimmy Butler at this point is career you're gonna wonder about games played I mean if you're playing fantasy basketball you know the deal with Kawaii that's just not really somebody I want on my roster I mean if you I don't know you could I mean you could Target I don't know I'm just looking at other guys in this General range right I mean I don't know throw throw an offer out on you know like Bane or marketing or Anthony Edwards or you know Trey young somebody like that yeah I mean if you go fishing on those offers for players who technically rank lower than Scotty bars but have a better pedigree yeah I think that's fine I just I just I really wouldn't want to be dealing with the Kawaii issues it's like you know it's not like he or the Clippers have looked great even when he's been healthy so far should I start playing business by ambo Alex a question that it feels like we're forced to answer this at some point every year it came a little bit early or that we expected but he always he always has his moments you know stepping and he started now four games four Memphis he's got two double-doubles and he has double digit rebounds in the four four days of double-digit rebounds and two double doubles I completely butchered that Steven Adams out Brandon Clarke is still out but you know big part  of the reason that by elbows had this run is that Xavier Tillman is also missed time he did not play last night against the Clippers Tillman seems like it's going to go game to game so there's no real timeline as far as you know how much more time he's gonna miss you could play tomorrow against the Lakers after that they play Saturday and Sunday in a back-to-back again San Antonio and Boston  I mean for this week like I went out and grabbed by elbow and a couple of weeks I'm gonna try to ride this thing out even once Tillman's back he's probably not startable at that point but I at least want to see how he's used because they they clearly need this a defense I mean that's really right now  yeah I mean the part of the problem with this question or wondering whether or not you should pick up biombo is like every every day that you've waited there you're getting like your return on investment is riskier because Tillman Mike come back and then the minute split might go like you know Tillman starts playing 30 minutes a game again and then beyond those playing 18 minutes and then you have to drop it but we don't know until it's coming back and I was actually be humble  I they don't have a lot of size like they like losing Steven Adams tell him is short like he's short for a center and Alma's not really a center he's kind of like a he really is like a power forward sometimes he plays like a small for he's a Gallinari I don't know I don't know what kind of position that is its own thing but I think Beyond only needs 25 minutes a game which he's getting right now to be fantasy relevant so should you start playing them yeah sure a sticker with our theme of Buy Low targets Alex can I can I issue in McCall Bridges this is his value sunk low enough he ranks 58th right now in eight cat per game  as a Buy Low um sure I think  is 3.2 is going to improve I think that's that's the main thing you're looking at right now with Bridges he's shooting 27% from three he's basically a 36% career three-point shooter so we should probably be averaging like 23 a game rather than 20 but I gotta be honest like Bridges was one of the guys where I wrote in like overrated picks for each round column and I thought Bridges and round two was just not I didn't like it  you know his steals his defensive numbers are don't reflect how good he is as a Defender you know I think if Bridges was really going to function as this like Elite number one option this season he would have done it already  and he's just not showing that from like a usage rate standpoint a Best Buy Low Targets in points leagues specifically I think this applies to pay Cairo like we talked about you know this guy who's much better in points leeks last season you know somebody who you still worry a little bit about the free throw percentage specifically we'll see on the field goal percentage I'm pretty optimistic on that you know if you start shooting the three better and again it's at 407% so it's not really killing him right now does anyone else come to mind for you I know Kate Cunningham like ranks pretty low in Roto it doesn't feel like it's a Buy Low necessarily because he's averaging 23 and 7 and feels like you spend really good so far but you know field goal percentage is hovering around 40% so that's something that's harming him quite a bit in Roto League's and obviously is not a concerned points  yeah I mean  well yeah I love the Bilo on Cape Cunningham and points League because he is shooting you know 4130 but I don't see like I hate I hate to make it so I hate to make it so simple but just go to the field goal attempts page and basketball reference and pick out everyone that shooting like 40% and that's that Sugar can be shooting that badly and you can just start throwing out offers for guys because like that's in place it really like a points and he used to think Julius Randle honestly too like throwing an offer on Julius Randle points League because the field goal percentage isn't killing you and then when you start shooting back are you get the Boost of the points so like it's those types of guys yeah Randall might be the ultimate one right now and I know he's played a little bit better of late but I think a lot of people are still going to be scared off by those first couple of weeks we'll get some more questions in a moment but got a couple of

you're just checking box scores you know Carousel Verde is somebody who I feel like it's burned me so many times and fantasy that I just didn't really didn't really consider him all that much you know specially with the back court in Cleveland but you know this is a team that even after bringing in Max Drews you know Isaac Coral still in the mix we're seeing Levert every single night VA relatively high volume player for this offense he's coming off of 29 and 22 points in back-to-back games over the weekend I was watching that game against okay see last week  16 field goal or futile attempts I should say four keros Levert obviously that's not going to be sustainable but it's been a nice start for him up close to 19 ports for games so far  I think Levert's improved their trusting him a lot more which I think is really important he has improved as a Defender I saw like a nice thread on Twitter of him you know playing great defense the other night I think I think this is fairly real because partially is shooting percentages are not on sustainable and they need a guy like him you know when Garland and or Donovan Mitchell or on the bench to bench to kind of run the offense a bit and they're really not a deep team at all so that works in your favor as well so I think it's I think it's fairly real yeah good question on Gordon Hayward somebody who's played very well for me in the stake league so far but you know we have the alleged impending return of Miles bridges that could complicate things for Gordon Hayward and even if Bridges wasn't coming back it's like you know you know hayward's getting hurt at some point you know we've been through this song and dance like five years in a row now so is now the time to to sell on Gordon Hayward and if so like what you know what range of players are should we be targeting  now is absolutely the time to move on from Corbin Hayward you got nine healthy games off of them that's a win no he writes 60 right now every buggy if you're playing in an informed fantasy league people who understand who that Corgan Hayward is an injury risk I it's gonna I'll be honest it's gonna be really tough for you to get like a projected top 100 player for him just because he has that stink on him and bridges is coming back so you have to kind of take a player back that people are really lukewarm on like if you can get back like valentina's maybe if you can get back I don't know who other good examples are but like what about like herb Jones Deni avdija you know even like I hate it but like Dillon Brooks Devin vassell guys like that I mean Austin Reeves has been off to a slow start maybe you could probably him away yeah I don't know if both managers are saying yes to that but I think you're right that you need to temper your expectations unless you're in a league where people don't know his history and don't know about miles Bridges and just think this can continue so start high don't start too high but you know realistically I think you're looking for somebody who could finish 85 to 120 yeah yeah I think that top 80 is great like I like the cell will be awesome I would do that in a heartbeat  Reeves I think that's a that's a pretty solid suggestion but yeah you do have to worry about bridges and injuries for Hayward how many more games before we confirm say this Killian Hayes breakout is a thing and not just rotation Shenanigans by the Detroit Pistons huh I wish I had a better answer I mean I have no idea how this rotation is going to ultimately shake out but you know Killian Hayes if you just isolate the the last six games 15 points 6 assists field goal percentage has been good the 3-point shot looks like it's largely improved I mean the percentages have been good he's been a sub 30 3% shooter or three-point Shooters whole career so take that you know with some would have a great assault I think you know even if you get like 33% out of him for the year that's fine but you know I the question I guess more than anything is is the Detroit rotation settled you know like does you know Monte Morris Joe Harris Beyond bucket I just those guys being out ultimately impact Killian Hayes if and when they returned  I don't think the Detroit rotation is settled um you know we had  last night against the Bulls  we had Jake and Ivy and Alec Burks come back from injuries Birch Place 21 minutes Ivy plays 11 minutes I think that will increase Sasser goes to 20 and then Killian Hayes is down to 25 so already you're you have to have some concern about is killing Hayes going to go back to playing like 20 to 25 minutes and then of course we have even seen Monte Morris play for this team it's so I don't and I think we have to kind of like Wonder  to me this isn't like Haze has had what he had like five good games you average 16 and 6 for five games on some really hot shooting but for the year he still only ranks 133rd per game so I I have no confidence in this like keep them on your roster it's Monday right see what happens this week but then if he keeps playing 25 minutes you can let him go  yeah the flip side of this is Jane Ivy who played you know 11 minutes after missing four games in a row with an illness played 11 minutes yesterday against Chicago I mean is there is there any Buy Low potential with him or you just staying away at this point I I am so I'm so far away from from Jake and Ivy right now that I I just know to me there's there's no Bilo  how about Daniel Gafford I think he could be considered a Buy Low I don't know a lot of wizards players making their way into this episode as they should but you know the minutes have been all over the place for Gafford yeah they played a relatively competitive game yesterday against Brooklyn he had one foul and he played 16 minutes but prior to that played 30 minutes and gave you 10 points tonight boards and four blocks he already has a five block game this year as well multiple every other game except for yesterday he has two plus blocks this season so I'm I'm still not Gafford but I really I only end up for the blocks I'm not expecting anything else it's a it's like a Buy Low in the sense that I it's hard for me to imagine playing less than 22 minutes a game I just think there's a lot of times where well first of all Washington's getting killed every game so their mechanics are going to be messed up every night and I think West on sale the honestly just  he he puts guys in the game when he thinks they're playing well and if they're not he just pulls them and won't pull them back in and I was some of what Washington is doing they all like to play small now  so they're playing like a video Kula Bali kuzma get Center Gallinari play some Center for that because looked good so  yeah I mean it's  don't expect this to drastically change this season but if you were asking me what I buy low on it yeah cuz it's hard to imagine it being worse  yeah and almost everybody needs blocks right and I don't I think more often than not gaffords gonna play 20 to 25 minutes as opposed to 16 to 20 so you're gonna have to live with the you know some of the zero weeks like he's not somebody that you're necessarily starting comfortably out of three game week on a four-game week I feel a lot better about it so I think if you choose to view him as more of a spot starter then you're going to be you're gonna be happy with the rewards because I think the shop blocking is good enough to to at least maintain his value outbreak and goon Alex what is our take on his rest of season upside certainly top 50s and the top 50 right now it categories you know free throw percentage is likely going to continue to be in issue he's down to 61% on the year he's taking almost four per game that's about the same as last year it was taken more threes he's also missing almost all of them so that's that's hurting his free throw percentage but he's still at 60% from the year so you know that's not really that big of a concern unless for some reason he starts taking like four threes a game you know the shop blocking has been a little bit frustrating the lack of but other than that I mean I've Loved what I've seen you know that the scoring is up the rebounds have basically sustained he's almost doubled his assist production and he still giving you a steel per game  you know I think because of some of those specific category defects like it's going to be tough for him to break like the top 40 or top 30 certainly but I think he said well somewhere between 40 and 50 on the year yeah I think he a top 50 I think everything that he's doing right now is perky sustainable and you can expect the bounce up and probably free throw percentage I know I think I think some people are gonna look at his field goal percentage and say well can he really do shoot 60 on increased volume I think he can because he actually has a real point guard now playing next to him that can feed him shots you know unlike like when shengwen had to be doing a bunch of stuff himself he was getting no passing inside no help from Kevin Porter Jr so to me everything that Shane gun is doing right now is is this who he is  he got a Bonus Pistons question just why is it get out of the dog house at some point and soak up some of the minutes that they'll take away from Duran to keep him healthy or is why he's been destined for a new team soon enough  I would say the latter and that dude team might be like the Fort Wayne Mad Ants I don't really see the upside here even with her and missing time recently it's like why it's been just grabbing a few minutes off the bench you know if he was never the number two overall pick we'd probably not be talking about whatsoever and I think that that luster is completely worn off and boy on ball ganowicz you know should be back at some point this month obviously why it's been more of a true Center but I think about it eats into some minutes at the four maybe that pushes Isaiah Stewart into the mix you know alongside Bagley and during that Center so I don't I don't really concern myself with any any Wiseman chairs right now no wise men like you mentioned I mean it's maybe he'll be on Barcelona with Jabari Parker sooner than later I I think you have to note that like Monty Williams said at the beginning of the year that they would only be playing one backup center behind Jalen Duren that it would be either be Marvin Bagley or James Wiseman and it's yeah not James Wiseman so he's just not gonna play  this is an interesting one I have a lot of Jeremy Grant Alex so I'm curious to get your take is Jeremy Grant by low targets and this this listener says that he was offered Clint capela for Jeremy Grant so he'd be getting the the Jeremy Grant side of this one but let's just put that one straight up like who would you rather have capella Grant  I think I would rather have  capella  I I like what capella brings from like a rebounding and blocks perspective I will say at the same time I do feel like Jeremy Grant is a goodbye low because  he is a better shooter than 42% from the field and you know like his percentages will go up look at the same time he's doing a lot of this without Anthony Simon's without scoot Henderson and everything like that so I I think I prefer the capella side  but because Jeremy Grant he's just only he's just points that's all you're getting from is just points you get some threes he's giving you like almost two and a half threes a game but because he's taking so many threes the field goal percentage hasn't been good you know he takes he takes a ton of free throws almost seven a game and he's at 77% so that's not helping you either I I'm still kind of holding out some hope for Jeremy Grant but like you said I think you got to be realistic about categories and if you need if you need blocks and rebounds then they take capella like I guess it feels like maybe Coppell has been a little disappointing but  he's doing what he did last year right I mean the rebounds numbers are the exact same he's actually blocking more shots you know people percentage is down slightly but free throw percentages up so that cancels out I don't I don't really think he's off to a bad start necessarily I think this is just kind of the player that he is the only concerned would be you know does does a Kong we eventually you know grab a larger share of minutes that Center but at the same time you know Capella's he's only playing like 21 to 26 minutes both nights so I don't see it going much lower  no I think I think if you're a points League I prefer grant let me clarify that if you're in a points League I would rather have Grant but you know in a roto League or a category League I would it's closer to even and I might just prefer capella all right we got one more message from rival fantasy Lebron vs Jordan magic vs bird Barkley versus Michael is synonymous with Legendary player rivalries they make the game more fun and

24 NBA season time to step up to the challenge on Rival fantasy we will see you in the arena uh let's see regular listener of the program free key says you just tuned in what are we doing with tyus Jones so back we go now Alex do the Washington Wizards yet again man I had such high hopes for Ty's Jones I was targeting him all over the place I guess luckily I did not get him in as many spots as I wanted I do have them in our 16 Team league you know he's he's kind of been putting up the same numbers that he was as a backup last year which normally would be would be fine but considering the jump and roll considering what we thought he could be in Washington it's been pretty disappointing and it seems to be seems to be getting worse you know last six games 7.2 points 3.8 assists per game still giving you good like steals permit it numbers but much like a lot of players on the Wizards if it kind of seems like they're at the whims of what was on sale night tonight  and I don't think you're going to lose your league or like regret dropping ties Jones at this rate but because  we were saying to draft ties Jones under the caveat that like he needs 30 to 34 minutes a game to be fair as he relevant it's not seeing 30 minutes a game and he's not a more significant part of the offense than he was in in Memphis and he's just not someone to hold for any for any amount of time really to be honest  someone in my league wants to trade dejounte Murray and Austin Reeves for Jalen Brown  is this a fair deal John Deere ranks quite a bit ahead of Jalen Brown so far this year you know if that matters still small sample size I think I would rather have the Murray Reef side of this I think Murray and brown are pretty comparable in a vacuum and I would like to buy low in Austin Reeves so this is a pretty easy one for me do you agree the to me this is 100% I mean Jalen Brown some nights is gonna be like their fourth option in Boston and did Jonathan Murray is a proven top 30 40 player which is what Jalen Brown now his absolute ceiling has been proved can do and he's he's no longer he no longer has that feeling and then you get Austin Reeves for free in my opinion so yeah with you on that yeah ha John Day take that side of that deal this is a tougher one for me coraz I just got an offer for Jalen Duren to take Jalen Williams what do you think so would you give up Jalen Duren for Jalen Williams of the OKC Thunder I would not I would I would if I have during them I'm hanging on I think they're I think they're ceilings are roughly the same because to me Jalen Williams had a feeling of like fifth round fourth round maybe and Jill enduring right now is proving that he he just is a fourth or fifth round value so I would rather have different like and some of his stats during stats are kind of muted lately because he's been dealing with an injury so his minutes are a bit low as stats are a bit low I would I would stick with Darren  yeah the thing with Duran is he still not blocking a ton of shots you know so it's you're kind of just targeting like mid-level points high-end rebounds one block a game and then the field goal percentage and yeah I don't know if we really trust him yet as a free throw shooter he was 61% last year this is this is pretty tough for me I mean  the thing with Jaylen Williams too is he you know he's not doing a whole lot outside of scoring thus far and you know had 301 last night against Phoenix so you know it was coming in hot right now but he only had one rebound and one assist in that game is giving you like a steal per game the percentages have been Elite though in 52 percent for a guy who basically plays on the wing that's that's a lead it was Elite last year as well and the free throw percentage she was taking take it 4.2 per game and he's at 86% so that would be one where you evaluate your roster you know if you're in a category league and you're struggling and free throw percentage I think jail Williams is somebody that could address that whereas you know Darren's got to continue to hurt it right and you know Williams his usage rate isn't that much higher than it was last year and he you know Chet's taking some usage Giddy and Shay are gonna do their thing so um I'm cool sticking with Duran there  cam reddish or Skylar maze for a 10 team points League I'm going maze I can't do it I can't I have to I have to be honest man camera ish is a automatic do not roster for me I like he's looked good lately but like throughout his entire career I feel like Nick and I've been doing this podcast and there's been like a six game stretch where it's like is this it is Cam reddish finally doing it and all of a sudden he goes back to averaging like three points again so definitely pick up Skyler May special since the assists are are ridiculous are going to be harder to find on the waiver wire than what Russia's doing yeah I think both of these guys you know your if you're looking at it as some of a week to week streaming spots you know if you're in a daily League even better but four games this week for Portland three next week and then they have another three game week after that so it's okay schedule for Skylar Mays but it's really more dependent on Brockton and even more so good Henderson but that's that's a guy I would trust you know if you're just looking for a seven games give me Skylar Bays  let's see  drop Gafford for OG brand Adobe yes I don't know what league this is but do that let's say sir you any 16 league but absent whatever League format you're in absolutely do that  good question from Nicholas Lee he asked I hear people saying to drop Andrew Wiggins I have also heard that is that realistic and if I do drop it who should I pick up for him this is a nine category 14 Team league so in that format I don't I still don't know if I'm like actively trying to drop Andrew Wiggins I mean it's been it's been pretty pretty bad so far you know even the games where he's played relatively well it's been more you know real life success is supposed to Fantasy but you know if you if you play the streaming game right you could definitely do better than what weighs is giving you over the last couple of weeks  yes the fourth the fact that it's a 14 Team league makes it more difficult if you weren't a 10 Team league I would say drop him yesterday but um  it's difficult look I think he has droppable like Nick said because Wiggins even  even in Wiggins best the scenario where he's playing 30 minutes a game like he has with the Warriors He's like like he's ranked like 80th he's like 80 to 100 ish  and he's just not close to being there from a minute's perspective even when he's shooting comes back which it will like he he will not shoot 15% from three and 41% from the field has defense hasn't been there who's usage is about the same as last season I just I think I think you can stream in that spot and you're not going to regret it  yeah I would I mean I would just double check on you know guys like I don't know Nas Reed Dorian Finney Smith Royce O'Neill you know some of the usual streaming characters from the last few years that they could probably give you more than what Wiggins is giving you right now and if you're if you're going to drop him just make sure you get somebody out of four game week because you're in fourteen Team league you're probably not going to be thrilled with your options but if you're getting somebody for four games especially on a week where you know Wiggins has two or three then you're probably gonna end up profiting there  let's see Kool-Aid tripping ask I don't know what to do with Bruce Brown he's not hurting my team but he's not helping much either should I keep him or should I stream the Bruce brown spot  I have Bruce Brown and the industry pick up League and honestly he's mostly valuable to me because he's like multi-position eligible and I'm like all right I can put that man in at forward um but no I don't I don't think you should expect him to play any better than he is right now I have to be honest because  his shooting is all it's all sustainable like he is not underperforming in that aspect  his usage is down 4% compared to last year in 4% is a lot I know something like I say I talked about usage rates all the time I know do it to a lot of people that doesn't like me know anything  but if you can't reach like 20% usage as a guard that's a problem in general and he was at 18 last year and he's at 14 this year so um I think he's he's ranked 128th is the exact same as he finished last year he's I I would consider him a streamer so you can keep in mind your bench and playing on four game weeks and it's gonna be fine but you should not worry about dropping him yeah well here's the thing for one he's rostered in 21% of ESPN legs right now and that you know that covers a wide range of settings and size and whatnot but you know it's not like you're dropping somebody who everybody else is hanging on to the Pacers also don't have a four game week until mid December and they have a two game week this week so yeah I would you know I would look into that part of that is like I think there's like a n Season tournament week coming up where like the schedules not decided but I don't think that'll be a four game week so there's just not really like you know later in December they have a couple back to back four game weeks you know that could be a spot to Target him but yeah if we're talking streaming like you're not putting in your lineup on a two game week this week anyway and if you feel like you need to make up some ground then yeah go grab somebody on a three or preferably a four game week I don't think you'll regret it  should I drop Chris Paul for key update George  no I would say no I want Chris Paul  I also want Chris Paul I understand why you're asking the question I want to be I want to be clear I would rather have Chris Paul but I understand why you're asking yeah  I I just I that's my good for Paul lately but I just I mean it's still wildly more dependable I think we could like we said earlier we could see a keyonte George like breakout week or two later in the year I was just like you got a time that outright and I think in general considering the limited minutes and the fact that he's coming off the bench like it Chris Paul still giving you seven and a half assists you still giving you a steal and a half per game you know the field goal percentage is concerning he's not making any threes and at some point you know that comes back around but I still think you know week to week night tonight Chris Paul is going to give you more of what you want  yeah  thoughts on PJ Washington miles Bridges returns this week will he start or is he cooked fair question you know PJ Washington it feels like every year you know has sometimes it's at the start of the Year sometimes it's in the middle sometimes it's at the end he has these these months and these runs where he looks really good I think he starts initially I'd be pretty surprised if miles Bridges is just like in the lineup right away certainly he could end up grabbing a spot at some point you know Washington does have Center eligibility in some league so that's something that gives him a little bit of a boost he's also probably a little more effective in real life than fantasy like he doesn't he doesn't really block shots for being a big man he's not a great rebounder it's kind of just points and threes so that I think there is a reason for concern here I you know we already laid out our concerns for for Gordon Hayward as well I think both of those guys are kind of equally harmed by Bridges  I think I think the answer to this both of these questions could be yes I think he could I think he could start and could be cooked so with the year that Bridges broke out and was healthy PJ Washington he ranked 1007 per game Roto a cat only had a 15% usage rate he's at 18 right now like yes I think he's going to shoot better from three look I mean Washington's always kind of been a fringe guy in terms of like a streamer um keep them on your bench playing before game weeks kind of a guy but you know if Bridges comes back and Washington starts seeing like 28 minutes a game to me that's like an automatic drop like I'm not gonna really worry about it  all right yeah we mentioned Gordon Hayward earlier and this is actually a good question you know we were we were talking about if you're trying to sell high at Gordon Hayward and Now's the Time to do it who should you target would you take shade and sharp back for him  oh man um so  I might yeah I think I I think I would but I I did caution people in an article I wrote about like players performing extremely well  that I don't think  I think sharp sharp is like a one-dimensional fantasy player like he's a points guy he does not pass very well he's not gonna Steals and blocks guy he's fine from three but like the minutes I mean seriously he's averaging 39.4 minutes per game just play 405 straight yes so and he's averaging 20 a game so when he starts playing he played 28 minutes in the opener  so when Simon's comes back when Brogden comes back when scoot comes back is sharp gonna play 28 minutes of game in average 14 points it's pretty possible and then it's gonna be like one and a half assists yeah um like you want to say yes because you worry about Hayward staying healthy but  honestly I don't know man I I might I might kind of lean hey word on this okay so if you're if you're looking to trade Gordon Hayward you're looking for somebody with a little bit less  confusion I guess as far as the role yes come back yeah I I think that so I'll I think it's the right area of like General fantasy value to Target like I think that's the right guy  to take a swing for and Theory it's just I I have my own sort of personal concerns about shaking sharp that I feel like other people don't necessarily have  okay yeah I think that's fair I think that's fair enough we got a good question on Jared Allen is the top 80 player this season asks Luke I mean Jared Allen has a pretty nice fantasy pedigree right I mean he was a top 60 guy last year top 50 in per game the year before that is final year at Brooklyn where he split it between the Nets and the calves he was closer to the 90th overall player it's been off to a slow start since he came back obviously was injured to begin the year but it's been relatively down now last year he was a almost 33 minute per game guy this year through four appearances he's averaging 25 minutes per game but it's been a tough going up over the last couple of games so I think once he's once he's fully integrated you know maybe he doesn't have a ton of upside Beyond like I would say I would say he could be a top 70 guy Max but you know I think the cabs are adjusting to to playing smaller you know getting more shooting on the court that's something that worries me a little bit without Alan but I still think he's pretty solidly like a top one hundred guy once he's fully up to speed and he's only he's only been back for a week yeah the playing time still been restricted still working his way back from it was a high ankle sprain or a bone Brewers I can't quite remember um but yeah to me he's like kind of ranked to answer your question like yes I think he's kind of like between a 60th ranked and 90th ranked guy you know obviously I think they want to feature oven moldy more um but if if you're sort of asking that wondering like should I trade him for a guy who I think is top 80 I would try to trick him for a guy who I think is top 60 otherwise I I would just hold and see what he does when he's fully healthy  is that calls are Jenny it's an interesting one  that is a that's kind of a tough question I actually have both of them and in the industry pickups so I look at the ism  he's playing pretty well I mean I think you were drafting him hoping he would be a top 100 player and he is you know funny enough he started the season with like his as much  mechanics concerns as everybody else on the roster through his first five games but after his past four games he's seeing 31 minutes a game he's got some of the most consistent moments on the whole team and I think what he's been doing over that stretch has been pretty real in terms of Zach Collins I mean I  you know Collins has been injury risk in the past but I don't think you have to worry about something like they stopped playing him next to when Benn Jama or anything like that there were turning about the same value on the year  I don't think I necessarily prefer one over the other  I would give slight favorite to Collins for what it's worth  yeah slight favor but  I was looking at this one I would not think too hard about this one  okay all right fair enough Jalen Smith somebody who I added in a league over the weekend thoughts on him should I consider looking elsewhere this this question asked her Johnny says he's currently sitting in second place in a 10 team nine cat League 50 and attend Team league then jailed Smith like I  yeah it wasn't like I was you know it wasn't you wasn't my first ad I'm not even gonna use it this week because the Pacers have a two game week and they don't have a four game week like we just said coming up until mid December so take that into consideration hard to say who's available but by my first thought is you could probably do better I'm I'm shy yeah I think you absolutely can do better it's important to note that he is shooting 70% from the field and 65% from three and seeing just 18 minutes a game so when he's shooting comes down the points are coming down and then he's gonna average like eight you know eight points seven rebounds and there's going to be intent team leaders there's gonna be plenty of other options for you  is James hardened washed Rusty or just that bad at sharing as freaky  yeah it's been that's strange obviously the Clippers have not look good since James Harden came back button like Harden's game is just so tailored to Fantasy Basketball is my voice is just completely going out on me here he still ranks at the top 40 in per game value like it feels like it's been a disaster and you know the odd Court doesn't necessarily match up with the fantasy value but you know if you're just asking for like hard specifically I know he was going he was going into 50s in the late drafts that I did yeah a couple nights before the season started so if you feels like this is been like a worst case scenario start you still a top 40 guy I think he just hold that I think it's gonna get better  yeah I mean is he is he or Rusty or bad at sharing I mean I you're talking about a 34 year old with recent leg injury issues that we all know doesn't take care of his body and he's now on a team with you know two other fairly High usage guys and Kawaii and Paul George but as Nick pointed out he's still putting up great fantasy numbers even though it's only been four games I will say they usage rates had only 19%  after being like 30 it's kind of interesting to keep an eye on but I think he can I think he can be both all three of those things and yet still ranked like top 40 in fantasy  yeah I agree with you there I took them in the 50s and one of my late drafts and I'm still happy with it I think it's I think it's gonna be fine I don't you know the Clippers make some sort of sweeping changes if they keep losing I think it's Russell Westbrook who suffers more than Harden good question from Henry thoughts on Triple J super inconsistent blocks are lowered will he get better I sure hope he does because I paid big money for him in an auction League where I need him to perform my closer to a top 20 guys instead of a top 50 I it has been really inconsistent I mean the bad nights he's got he's got a five for 17 he was three for 15 last night against the Clippers the other three-point shooting has been very up and down he's at 32% from the year 83 percent of the line though which is nice because he's taken a lot that's a big jump from last season but yeah really the blocks I think are the issue here everything else is about in line with what you'd expect but three blocks per game last season in 28 minutes this season he's playing closer to 32 minutes per game and he's only at one point eight so yeah it's a little concerning I mean he has not had a multi-block game now and four straight  yeah I mean I  he's a big of a inconsistent offensive player in general but I think he's giving you what you were looking for on that side of the ball  as far as defense goes I think it's important to  know like how you know a block or a steel is something that happens like for a you know a player like Jackson like twice a game you know 100 possessions so like he could he could just as easily next game  next three games get six combined blocks or next to get he could have three blocks next game three blocks the next game and then we're not even having a conversation about his blocks because then they're at 2.4 per game so there's to me it's it's there's no worry there  all right well go rapid fire through a few more of these and we'll be on our way out Jaime Hawkins can he be useful as a streamer with the heat be upping is usage I wouldn't expect a usage hike necessarily but I think you know on draft day like when he ended up there we're like this is this is the perfect heat guy like I think if he was on just about any other team I don't know that you know you trust them to develop him correctly but in a roundabout way I feel like he's benefiting from from Lowry and hero missing time and certainly Caleb Martin as well I mean like a he's technically a forward but he kind of do everything and you know the heat of such little depth at guard especially point guard that you know they kind of have to shift pieces around and you know you wouldn't necessarily think that Lowry hero being out is like a one-to-one core relation for his but I think it's open things up for him I be comfortable streaming him I mean he's really interesting player he's played six or at 70 combine minutes over the last two games gives you a little bit of everything you know the Steel's numbers have been really good don't expect to block shots I don't think that's this is not really who he is he's pretty undersized you know three-point shooting is going to be lower end but you know to answer the overall question is he a streamer yes they have a three-game week this week and then they play Four the week after so maybe that's the time to use them  he's absolutely worth the risk and like Nickelodeon to the risk is just that last game Kyle Lowry didn't play the game before that Jimmy Butler didn't play so we have yet to see the Heats  sort of like full rotation without Tyler hero we kind of got that in the game that hero went down with injury and and Hawk has played 21 minutes but yeah he's worth the risk of you know dropping somebody that's underperforming to stream them his buddy hield a hold in 12 team category leaks should I hold with the possibility that he will start in a new team in a category League yes I still you know I'm a buddy hield Stan I guess Sim I don't know whatever word you want to use he's seventh in total made three so far on the year he's always I mean he's in the top three basically every single year he never misses time even with reduced role like I think by the end of the year he's going to be in the top five nobody has made more threes than him I think other than Curry since he entered the league nobody's played more games that buddy hield since he had the league so you got to live with the ups and downs and I know the like the trade thing is just kind of hanging over them and it's kind of weird situation but I will say that if you drop him into 12 Team league somebody's gonna pick him up  yeah he's worth exactly like you said you can keep them on your roster you can play on the four game weeks hopefully he gets traded and he starts um I will say though if you're getting  if you're in trouble fantasy wise like if you're in a 12 team or and you rank 11th you might have to drop him and make some really aggressive wave of wire moves to start climbing up the standings depending on what's going on with your roster all right let's talk Orlando Magic we got a few questions about folds and Jalen Suggs Johnny asks his Jalen Suggs worth rostering we got another question on Markel fultz what's up with his injuries should I drop or should I wait there's another Suggs question in here somewhere but oh yeah it was Kobe white or Jalen Suggs that one coming from Justin so let's let's start on on songs and we'll start with the basic question is he worth rostering  yes I think his  two steals per game 2.1 steals per game I guess 0.6 blocks are legit I know the blocks are not really increased from what he's talking the past the Steels are but last time I checked which is maybe a bottle a week ago he was like second in the league in deflections so the underlying stats with his steals suggest that he can continue to do this  field goal percentage is not very good okay it won't be but yeah roster for sure okay and that thoughts on faults I mean we we don't have any more injury news than anybody else we we just report an aggregate the news but you know Foltz has already been ruled out for tomorrow's game that will be his fifth absence in the last six I I think they're just going to kind of keep taking this game but it's worth noting that they have a Tuesday Wednesday back to back so you know might be something where they're already playing to bring back Wednesday who knows I don't have a ton of concerns here I mean it's a little concerning that he was scratched when he was supposed to play on Saturday and you know tendonitis is obviously something that could stem from for previous injuries and that folks has had plenty of those but you know in general I guess like even just assuming he's healthy he's not off to a great start it only played in five games but there's it's kind of a convoluted backward in Orlando overall  it is tendonitis is tough because it's a rest injury like the only way for attending August to get back is just to not do anything so he's just gonna have to sit until it hopefully feels better and then you know that's sort of a thing I think he's a whole you know because I I think he's a legitimate when he's healthy and going and he's playing 29 30 minutes he's got top 80 guy but if you're in a shallow League I understand wanting to drop him I would I would just have a little bit more patience okay yeah I'm with you on that should I dropped in witty who we talked about earlier I think we're in dropped territory with Dinwiddie but should I drop him for some of like Jordan Hawkins or Dillon Brooks bologna Bali or Lonnie Walker  you know Hawkins I don't I train Murphy's gonna be back soon you know he was he was at practice today in fact so I think you can make his return to the next week or two I think that really hurts Jordan Hawkins you know Brooks is cooled off a little bit cool Bali it's you know one really nice game I think I think for every game he has like he did yesterday there's gonna be seven or eight that are just Duds so I would not really pick up cool about you you can disagree on that if you want I guess I would probably take Brooks over Dinwiddie none of those options are super appealing I mean I guess Lonnie Walker too  I don't I don't really like any of those options I feel like you're in a fairly sharp League to be honest Nicholas if you're if those are really like your waiver wire options I'm also trying to drop dead in a league and its I'm finding it very difficult just because it's a you know it's a 16 team her and the options are even more than I don't think any of those guys that you mentioned Hawkins Brooks Kula Bali or Lonnie Walker are going to be necessary to roster for most of the season and I don't even think that they're streaming value is is that good that you know I can't blame you for dropping it for any of those guys like we mentioned before I think didn't really use droppable to stream the spot for guys in a Four game week so if any of those guys have a four-game week yes I mean sure it's fine  all right a couple more here looking for steals of the category League Robert Covington or Cam reddish long term  probably  oh man I just I wish I wish coming to was playing more than 15 minutes a game at the same time like do we trust register to play much more than 15 minutes per game when everybody is healthy and not really I think I I think coming to the better player than camera reddish and their minutes when both rosters are healthy are probably the same so I technically I guess Covington it's that's a that's a rough question I gotta be honest well I don't know if you heard Alex Kelly ubreak got hit by a freaking car this weekend so he can help Robert Covington at least over the next few weeks here yeah give me Covington I mean even in 15 minutes a game he's still I mean he had four straight games with multiple steals prior to yesterday against Indy so yeah he's the board Dependable player he's I mean he has multiple Seasons banked throughout his career and in Philly Houston Minnesota Portland you know where he's been like you know 1.3 you know 1.3 blocks 2.1 steals he been like blocking and a half steal and a half when the minutes are there and even with Uber out I don't think I don't think they come into play at 30 minutes but if you could just get into like the low 20s I think he's gonna be a hell of a lot more dependable than cam reddish let's see do you think yakka portal will return to what he was projected as Raptors invested so much in him that comes from a mayor I I hope so I actually I actually didn't get much of any much or any of portal this year so I've not I haven't been tracking this maybe as closely as others but yeah I mean the blocks are down the the rebounds are down slightly the minutes are down about two per game everything other than that I mean it's not like he's having a wildly disappointing season but he did play really well for Toronto after coming over from San Antonio last year I'm just not I'm not really sure I mean there's a new head coach you know kind of new rotations without Fred Van Fleet you know I think they kind of have to shake things up you know precious to chewa and miss some time he was back in Action yesterday against Boston and you know that doesn't bode well for turtle he only played 21 minutes so I think we just kind of have to adjust expectations going forward like still a guy who is roster Bowl to me and you know probably start a bowl for lack of better options most weeks but you know the dream of him being like the top 70 guy might be dead  I agree I mean when he was top 70 that was a lot of like him playing with San Antonio and they would handle the ball and have them do dribble handoffs and he would get the Fate he would get like fake assists and that's just not really happening this year and the minutes are there all right well and on this one I currently have Curry Maxi Paul George and McCall Bridges as by backhoe and Duran Jared Allen Mark Williams was my friend Court okay not bad I'm thinking about trading PG for Trey young what do you think I think I would do that  I think so yeah  yeah I mean well you got what your main concern has to be like hey do you have any forwards left so assuming that you're forward spot does not get completely destroyed by you making this trade I would I would look to acquire Trae young because he's not even shooting he's shooting 36% from the field and he's still ranked 23rd and 8 cat so and Paul George is healing is not that high  yeah I mean Paul George is off to a great start I do think that's gonna come down you know obviously with Hardy being integrated and just you know having like four pretty big miles to feed in that offense and yeah like you eventually he's not even playing that well and you still have a great fantasy year first as slight as Trey young is he also like never misses time and Paul George has missed more time to quite Leonard since he's been with the Clippers so that that would be my bigger concern is yeah maybe maybe we talked about Paul George as to how guys just because of the injury history so yeah good point by you because Claxton Duran Alan Williams like all those guys are centers first so make sure you have the depth stuff figured out but if you're if you're comfortable just making that deal one to one I think we agree we both rather have Trey Yuen all right we're gonna cut it off here is a fun 70 minutes we appreciate everybody jumping in in the chat these streams have been really fun and
