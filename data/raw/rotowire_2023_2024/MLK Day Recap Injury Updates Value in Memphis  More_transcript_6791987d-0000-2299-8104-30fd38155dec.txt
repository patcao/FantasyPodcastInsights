hey everybody I'm Steve Alexander Dr a welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy and FanDuel it's Tuesday January 16th  I'm Steve that's Yuri my good friend her first time on the show and we have a lot of news to cover from a busy MLK Day in the NBA so let's do this  yo welcome to the show one of my favorite things about my RotoWire basketball podcast is when they said you're going to get two shows a week  you're going to do one with Rick Cameron who's my my guy and the other one you can have whoever you want on every week we don't care as long as she talked about basketball so  you and I have a long history of playing fantasy basketball together correct correct yeah I think it has been that long it's been about 15 years and you play in one of we met and played in one of my more famous rock and roll Leagues with Stephen malkmus and you're always very competitive and very good and then you started playing FanDuel with me and my boys and you were winning so much that we kind of kicked you out of our little FanDuel League it was unfortunate that that had to happen but we just couldn't we couldn't take any we couldn't afford it  yeah dude you're the one that invited me to play it in the first place and then you kicked me out yeah my friends like what are you doing dude she's so good at this  so I'm sorry I'm sorry to that when you also sort of retired I feel like I did I stopped because it was too much is getting me too much so I stopped the daily and I've actually I'm only down to one League now because Malcolm's quit his his League he was commissioning and I'm just in your league now  yeah  you know what I'm I'm only in three League's that actually count this year and I used to be in no I mean  no three I used to be in like 12 to 15 every year I've got it down to three it's a miracle I can tell you're more focused you're you're on top of things in our league now  actually like up there in the top whatever have was I keep my team is such a  we go as when he goes  yeah yeah  well you want to dive into this do you yeah let me you know I'm Yuri and it's really great to be here Steve Dre and I wanted to give you big congratulations for winning that were being in the Hall of Fame for fantasy sports writers association I think that's so huge and you're writing is one of the main reasons that I got excited about fantasy because even before I was in the Malcolm sleep I was reading your stuff your blurbs and you're just you write about basketball and really fun and engaging way and and so kudos to you and and  congrats well thank you so much and you know that news broke while Camilla and I were doing this podcast on Tuesday that I had made it into the Hall of Fame but I feel like he should be in there too so I didn't want to like I didn't want to be like Oh I'm in the Hall of Fame on that show with him because I didn't want to I didn't want him to I didn't want him to be get upset or be mad or whatever and he was super cool about afterwards he's like man I'm so glad you made it I was like we gotta get you in there but um  you know it's kind of a funny thing because as people don't really know what the s f s w a is but there's only like 45 writers I think that are in that fantasy sports writers Hall of Fame so it's a really big deal in the industry I'm in I feel  like I'm a Pioneer in in fantasy basketball so I'm very excited about it but it's funny you tell me I tell people yeah I got these four hours Hall of Fame like the hell is that I mean it's a Hall of Fame dude I mean so you need to know okay so all Fame  are you gonna get a little plaque that you can put on your back wall there I hope I get a little plaque um I don't really know how it works and then I guess they do the show on a Series XM they do where I can give a speech acceptance  my induction speech or whatever so that'll be interesting to see how that goes down nice all right  well thanks Yuri that was nice  um  let's talk about what happened yesterday I'm sure these people like come on dude we're here to here about who to pick up and fantasy Hoops Jo ellan bead played at 41 points 10 boards Tyrese Maxie had 27 that rocket team and it seems like there should be so many guys that we should be able to go out there and pick up off waivers  but there's really not because they all spread out minutes so evenly and nobody really shines and nobody really sucks it's just kind of  just one Bland box score after another yeah it is kind of frustrating for a fantasy owner to see like who to pick up cuz everyone's playing really good too like they're well coached and they're firing and all cylinders and not like the Rockets team of last year for sure and years prior it's a I'm still holding Eason on my IR even though who knows but I got a spot there for him I just yeah  broke his back but he's just another one in the mix so  yeah and Atari Easton thing is so frustrating because he played so well he had that little stretch where you just went off and he's been hurt ever since and  you know if you got IR spot that's not full of other injured guys which is tough to do this time of year and you can hold tar he said I still I still say do it but I've kind of I've kind of moved on he's kind of gone the way of austere Thomson to me who actually made some noise yesterday we're gonna talk about that in a second  but you know the Sixers are one of only 16's that played tonight so you know in our league where you and I play against each other I don't have anybody going tonight or I didn't I went out and picked up your guy Kelly oubre right at 5:00 this morning just to have a warm body out there tonight  why do you say my guy  yes we were talking about who to pick up and you're like maybe not picking them up and dropping them  a lot this season that makes them qualifies your guy yeah just the fact that you mentioned his name he is very handsome too I like handsome guys um  yeah you think but tomb is going to play on the back-to-back  he has been playing back to backs  I don't know if them beat is gonna play on the back the back we see anything about that yet today I haven't seen anything yet it's so early like we're doing this at the crack of dawn in basketball terms  yeah I wouldn't be surprised to man and being sit this out honestly  and if that happens and Robert recovering still out then I think Uber could  yeah but too  yeah yeah another team  yeah I don't know I mean he did play back to back I think a week ago or a couple weeks ago  um  but I mean they need them with melting out  I just I feel like with Sixers Maxey and Peter really dominate that team and then there's little flashes of Tobias but the other guys just they're just real role players you know  so  they're also tough team to find streamers for they are it stinks because the Anthony Melton has such a fantasy friendly game but he's been hurt he's stuck behind Maxi and  I think Uber has a fancy friendly game but he splits minutes with platoon and Covington and Covington if he was getting 25 minutes a night he'd be dominating for my 30 Team league but he doesn't he's been heard again so I it's kind of a mess that's another messy waiver wire situation there speaking of interesting way OverWatch situations I don't know how the Celtics  can be as good as they are  and then you pluck Jalen Brown out of that line up  and they don't even they get started to even tell who they plug and play in his place I think it was a Horford  but they don't miss a beat man like that team is really really good I think it all starts with Drew holiday and they're quite being in the back court together and just stop putting up a wall against any guards that that come against that  totally I mean they're 31 and 9 they're they're the best team in the NBA and it seems like when one of their big guys are out it's just they still win and it's the back court I mean Derek white has been crazy good he's got to be in the the all-star  weekend he's got to  and  porzingis I have porzingis and  I love his game but I was at the risk you know rostering him but with the way that they're mixing it up with the back to back without Horford it seems like  fingers crossed zingus will be like around for the whole season so I'll take I'll take him resting on back-to-backs if I can have the whole season and I think that's what we're doing I think that's what subjects are doing they're like hey we're gonna conserve Horford and Brazilians all season long and just have to be right for the playoffs because we don't need them  they literally don't even need for zynga's to go out and dominate this league right now they're so good  it's and you know I I have been saying since before the season they were the best team League  there was a minute there was a little concerned about that but the Milwaukee does not look the same since  adding Lillard losing Drew and then everybody else is kind of Phillies pretty good but  Crowders back today  that should help me on defense a little bit Jae Crowder is coming back  wow that's I I forgot he was in the league on  asleep he plays for the bucks  huh you know welcome back Jake Crowder tonight  Pistons win Pistons win  I still don't understand what this team is doing camel explained it to me I still don't get it Alec Burks scores 34 points Off the Bench Jane Ivy is finally been turned loose with Cade Cunningham injury he had 24 jail in Durand was a monster with 20 and 19  even be still had a big line  and I'll start Thompson  27 minutes 14 points 8 boards three steals is that enough for you to run out and pick him back up or you think it's just a well no I'm okay blip he's he's had these blips before and I mean I'm fighting to make the playoffs I can't afford to have Asar on my team I drafted him and I did enjoy that lovely early season stretch of his where I was just so happy and pumped but this team is is messed up and I mean it's it's obvious now like when Kate Went Down people were like who should I pick up should I pick up ivy  Killian Hayes  Burks but it's obvious it's Ivy now it's time  but does Ivy go back away when he comes back I don't think so but  we'll see I don't think Burke's is going to go away I think they need Burke's  they need that vet out there there's going to be kind of consistent and score  but yeah I've had three blocks  last yesterday that was nice that was nice I met if true was playing tonight I'll be back on my team but they're not I do have  let's say guys name who's the guy that plays for Portland Jabari  Walker Walker gets Barry Walker on my team  why  no okay  he was the only guy who's playing the night and and I needed I'm I  so frustrating speaking of frustrating Yuri Zion Williamson and all that Talent  of course 30 points yesterday  one freaking rebound  i i as he doubled up ever in his life yeah man it must be so frustrating you know Zion because I've never roasted him and  he's yeah  very very weird Fantasy game I don't know how he can have 30 points and one rebound and playing the entire game of basketball but yeah he did it Ingram hit three or fourteen shots for 12 points ruined my both my Underdog and my FanDuel so that was that was pleasant thank you Brandon CJ McCollum and 20 points and they got beat my Dallas who did not have a luka doncic and Dallas has become a underdogs slash FanDuel Feeding Frenzy with Tim Hardaway and Kyrie Irving anytime  yeah right away at night 93 pointers of 41 points Kyrie scored 42  and they keep winning even whether Luke could plays or not it's  it's kind of where the Mavericks are much better than I thought they were going to be this year  I love watching Kyrie and Hardaway it's so much fun Derek Lively like it's it's so fun Kyrie is so good he's such a good basketball player so creative like just an artist out there  Allison of this one while I was driving do you listen to a lot of NBA games  or do you mostly watch him  I used to listen to a lot of NBA games but not not anymore I really don't know what it is maybe it's just cuz I grew up on radio but I just I love listening to NBA and I'm totally in the minority but this was fun to listen to  I like listening to like playoff basketball and like late at night when I'm driving across the country like that's my favorite and I remember like I found a Kings game the Kings Lakers game from like 20 years ago when we were driving through Tennessee one night I was like oh this is awesome and it was a big game and it was the one with all there's a lot of controversy in  back and forth and that was fun I and I used to  I listened a lot of Braves games on the radio mmm basketball I don't listen to on the radio as much but baseball  I love listening baseball on the radio yeah yeah but man uh you know Kyrie is such a polarizing NBA figure  and  a lot of people say man I just love saying any issues with anything Kyrie has done this season  okay we're back I don't have any issues with anything Kyrie Irving has done the season  he was legit her when do I have fell on his legs he missed a bunch of games that he probably couldn't play in and when he's out there he's being a good teammate and he's falling as hard as he can and it is fun to watch me and I I wouldn't be sad if I had carry on my team this year  I wouldn't be satisfied Hardaway on on my team right now I could use this I could use 93  your Underdog fantasy is number one platform for NBA best ball and DFS player Pick'em contest  if you haven't

just struggling  I hit like four out of five  see my problem is your I go for the five I go for the five like parlays I should just do two or three  increases your odds by so much I'm always trying to break the bank I'm always trying to hit it big yeah you know he hit four out of five and then  Jerry Jackson Jr doesn't double double and then you're you you've lost money I've lost a whole dollar so I'm also super cheap I tried a bit why I'm glad when I'm glad to hear you're still playing that the small money that's yeah well since I don't have a real job or income I can't really  afford to do anything else but it is fun I I like to throw in like 10 one dollar five-leg Carly's out there and just hoping one hits it's fun  I like Underdog it's good time  let's try it  I don't get me started um Jimmy Butler played a basketball game yesterday can you believe it 40 minutes  31 points  15 free throws made  I think he'd missed what like 11 was previous 12 games or 12 of his previous 13 or something ridiculous  so when Jimmy plays I mean that has implications across  that team unlike when Jalen Brown sits out it has no no implications  was out he already heard his groin injury  and then our guy Nicolas yovich who's been playing well didn't do anything at all and Duncan Robinson who has been kind of Hit or Miss lately and unfortunately is on my roster  was terribly yesterday didn't even score I don't think all his all his fantasy production came from rebounds and assists  so the  Jimmy Butler being back is gonna be weird for Hawks I don't care I'm still  telling people to hold on to Jaime Hawkins till till the end  well yeah because you just don't know about Jimmy's health  you know he's in and out all season and  it's one of those things where it's like  you it's unpredictable so you might as well and hockey as his proven himself  and here oh obviously in bam and and those guys are all good  yeah I stayed away from Miami this year so  I don't have any Miami guys on my team well and then on the next side it was all Michael Bridges and and my guy came Thomas who is  either scoring a ton of points not doing anything else or he's not scoring any points and not doing anything else he is a he's something else it's so funny there's definitely a type of person that is clinging and holding onto cam Thomas with fervor and almost with pride a little bit  and you're one of them and and my buddy Victor who's in chat he's another one  it's like Cam and when he has a good game it's like shouting from the rooftops yeah cam  well he did that the first week of the season I think he had three games or he just went off and he was on my bench and my 30 Team league  and then I got him in my lineup the next week and that was a disaster and then he was hurt like I have not had a good I've not had an enjoyable cam Thomas  this season but  he's a guy that in a 30 Team league  as a starter in your lineup that you got the 200 pick like he he's invaluable to me in that league so yeah it's  and I think because he's so valuable me my 30 Team league and makes me  show some sort of loyalty to him in my 12-man league  but maybe that's just stupid I don't know I mean he's holdable and and 12 so you're okay you've got a note here about Dennis Smith Jr yeah I mean since he started playing  for them he looks really good you remember was it in Charlotte where he was somebody got injured and he started playing and he was just so solid his defense  um and and he was like a rozabal rest of season player and that's what he's looking like that in Brooklyn  looks way better than didn't witty  well yeah dsj it was in Charlotte it was who was the point guard back then I can't even think oh Walker was Kemba Campbell went down and dsj came in yeah he was hitting threes he was getting steals he was doing everything he looked really good for like three weeks and then he went to Nicks and it was all it was all gone but he was kind of back I haven't really paid attention to the SJ is he sending on Weaver wires and our league he was picked up pretty quickly  all right I wonder what is I want to know what is people are on it and our league man they are they are  they pick them up  mid-game we were talking about Mark Smith yesterday and Mark Smith  didn't want to play in our league he's the he's one we guitarist and explosions in the sky and he he was on tour and we had dinner and I was like dude playing playing My League  and he's like man I I'm gonna be on the road so much I don't know if I can do it I'm like I know you want to he's like all right I'll play so he's in and he picked up GG Jackson yesterday like write off as soon as he scored like eight points right he was on it  he's been on it all season for somebody that's half committed supposedly  or Lando magic they lost three straight I think they came back and won they beat the niche yesterday  I don't understand how Orlando is having such a good season  they have like 17 point guards  they're weird at Center Palos really good friends has been hurt friends Wagner has been hurt  so I understand how they're how they're so good but  they are in their really kind of bland box scores in Orlando like there's nothing really exciting to see their usually when you go and check but  then the next event kind of exciting since they made that trade Jalen Brunson Julius Randle usually go off sort of like Hardaway and and Kyrie except Bronson was out yesterday again for the second game in a row  Julius Randle always scored 15 he was super quiet in this Quentin McBride character has kind of balled out for two games in a row for for Bronson misses more games  I think McBride is a guy you want to have in your lineup  seems like he's the guy what's his name Deuce deuce McBride yep that's a really cool name  I wish that was my name that's a very cool name Orlando I feel like they the same guys have been playing together now consistently for a couple Seasons I think they got really good chemistry I got to say Suggs  Suggs is like  I feel like a little bit like a heart and soul type of player of the team and he goes so hard that I mean I have one more team I just  it's only a matter of time before he injures himself because he goes so hard but I think the guys really rally around his type of play and they all show that kind of  that kind of play on Court and  I think I think they're really they've all they've been fun to watch too and I think the fans love them so I'm not surprised that that they're pretty good  this year  feels like it's been leading up to that a little bit  um yes and if Brunson misses another game I'm picking McBride up I also have breaking Dennis Smith Jr news he's only 11% roster in Yahoo leagues  which means he's probably like 6% roster in ESPN League's  Andy's on our waiver wire in our league is somebody dropped him yeah he's on waivers to late 18th so I mean we can't pick him up  right now but he's lovely I saved up some ads out there good news um  yes anything else with that game I don't the next I mean heart and Stein come on  she's Louise that's another one I snoozed on I think that was one of those cases where he was picked up before  nah he was picked up when the injury happened yeah he's he's amazing he's been so good but I'm worried about anyone like Jalen Brunson that's on a Thibodaux team because it's they get worked and then calf oh that's not good and he won't be allowed to have time to recover yeah um  so yeah um interesting on heart and stain I've been on the heart Steinman way and all  all year man I love hard Stein when he  is good when he was on the Clippers too  yeah um heart Stein is ball on out I  those two 20 rebound games and four blocks he's scoring some points and there's literally no one else there to play center and divided is Just Gonna Roll him out there for 35 minutes a night and it's gonna be super fun so I'm pretty psyched about what he is doing  yeah it's been fun  the Hawks  got 36 and 13 from Trey  they were blowing out these San Antonio Spurs Jalen Johnson didn't didn't more Jalen Johnson stuff 1610 76 that six steals  the chantays quiet again  weird vibe in Atlanta with with the Gente and  Trey and then you've also got this three-headed thing going on at forward with Jalen  DeAndre Hunter who's hurt and see Bay  and then you've got capella holding back Khan woo  I mean there's a lot of things there's a lot of position battles  going on in Atlanta that are all kind of messy  um Josh Lloyd I'm a big Josh Lloyd  Stan and he's been alluding to some kind of drama happening in Atlanta but he won't  divulge it on are do you know anything about this  I do not know I do not know the details of the drama I would assume  if I was gonna guess I'd say there might be a lady a lady involved  it's usually when it's drama on NBA teams that usually involves a woman I'm  my experience  so he's gonna get traded you think  I don't know what's gonna happen I think like then they've got to get rid of DeAndre I think they gotta get rid of DeAndre Hunter at this point and it sounds like  dejounte is creating tremendous interest throughout the league like the Lakers won him who doesn't want the John team Murray on their team right  and and Jalen Johnson you know they were saying on the TNT telecast last night that he looks like the most improved player in the league  this year I'm not gonna argue with that he looks incredible  so the Hawks  I don't think of that far from being really good I like the coach I think  I think they're in a good spot but I think  putting tray into Shante together as kind of fail it's a fail to experiment and if they traded him in it a couple studs  everything is fixable I don't know  yeah I'm sorry I don't know what the exact drama is in Atlanta though I wish I did I want to hear about the drama I can probably find out I could probably get my buddy Bobby a call and find out but yeah just text it to me I don't know what else you can do women yummy yesterday  I looked at his stat line at halftime Yuri I had him going in all my legs I had him in  FanDuel and Underdog and everything else nothing and then the second half he just went nuts he had five blocks 26 points 13 boards two steals almost all of that came in the second half I don't know what he was doing for the first half of that gave me he may have been sitting in the front row eating popcorn with that actress that owns the Hawks but I don't know he just went nuts the second half and then so hand and 23 points 8 boards forces to steals two blocks and two threes  you can't rely on that guy right like  but man if you gonna do that once a week I'll put him back on my team yeah I know I went to look to grab him because I knew he was on waivers  but he had been picked up by Amy I think so  yeah he might he might be  getting more time more minutes  going forward it's really hard to tell with Popovich though like like we don't know what pop is doing this year Jake Jones and 30 on Wednesday or on us Saturday and then he had two points last night I think  I don't know yeah  um  and that's sort of Way San Antonio was gonna be and now they play back-to-back on Friday and Saturday again so which one is when we gonna sit out  at least when we sitting games is the most frustrating thing ever I mean you know rumors that that's gonna start though the Management's gonna stop  you're gonna stop doing that yeah that's what I I thought I read that somewhere that it may it may have come up because I know when when pops said he was gonna do it it was based on you know until his ankle injuries healed so maybe maybe we're there that would be fantastic  yeah I should probably look into that  since this is  a job and all um  oh here we go this is gonna be this is now you're used me a gift one time back in the day  in fact when you're talking I'm going to go get it because it's so cool but  it's a Golden State Warriors gift and that is your team and when the warriors were rolling and Katie and Klay and Steph and gray were all killing it on all cylinders you were you were living your best life  yeah I've been a dose fan since the Run TMC days and  I  it was it's there were so much fun to watch small ball Nellie ball and then  the dark ears ups and downs and then freaking Dynasty happened and  I was looking enough to be a season ticket holder I think when it started was  right after they drafted stuff I think  so as a perk of the season ticket holder and I think oh David Lee to was there I think that was the first year that we had players in the in the all-star  weekend I don't even think they were in the game but anyway daily  and  stuff I think we're going to All Star weekend  and as a perk for season ticket holders we were asked to choose one player who we could have a signed jersey from  and me being this is if you know this is classic me where I just sometimes make the stupidest decisions that I regret for life I chose  we just saw we just drafted him  Anthony Randolph infinite I could have had a I think it was a rookie year Steph signed jersey  but no Anthony Randolph and  then I was like and then I think you really liked Anthony Randolph for some and I was just like I'm gonna give doctor a this jersey so there it is I was always trying to cling on to the Anthony Randolph bandwagon because he had that really incredible  two week run in April of  2008 I think it was somewhere around there where he just went nuts in meaningless games  and I was I was all about Aunt ran because he would get steals he would get blocks  and he's became my guy and you sent me in autograph dancing Randolph Jersey which that story is hilarious because  I mean why would you not send that to me and you had you had you picked the Stuff Curry rookie autographed jersey I'm guessing I would not have gotten that in the mail yes hanging up in your house somewhere or you be wearing it every day of your life yeah and yeah I don't even want to think about it no well I do love it though it's a cool I mean  it's cool Jersey and it's signed by Aunt Rand and I've got it my attic how many people can say they've got a sign of ant Rangers in their seriously right see I did you a solid there it's a conversation piece it really is I'm gonna hang it up it's gonna replace Lucas Luca for a minute  um  speaking of Golden State Memphis beats them yesterday without any of their guys write with a bunch of Julie's what was the red on that game  the yeah yeah  I have no idea but  Jones Jackson Jr had 18 and 5  what for steals a block and three three-pointers like he did his job yeah um  my guy Vince Williams Junior who I'm all fired up of about 24.7 boards for assists  two steals blocking three three pointers and those were the highlights for Memphis I mean they're so banged up right now like we can go through a list of like five or six guys and and decide what we'll do that right right after I think GG Jackson was the highlight of Memphis at least in terms of fantasy people were talking about him like creating them up make game I mean it was nuts yeah I missed I missed yes GG Jackson was the highlight 23.6 boards  two assists two steals five three-pointers yeah I was  I was I Had a Brain fade there for a second so yes GG Jackson Who a lot of people have never even heard of he went South Carolina he's been in the Glee this year he just turned 19 years old  went off yesterday and his interview on TNT afterwards was awesome so cute yeah he's cute that's a good word for it yeah and like I think everybody who saw that is now a GG Jackson fan  now are you running out I I couldn't you know I posted I posted on basketball monster like should I drop niece Smith for Gigi Jackson I don't know anything about him tell me what to do and everyone I got thinking I got people saying yes drop niece Smith for GG Jackson and then  I get home and he's already picked up by Zelda  explosion dude yeah  so we'll see I mean I  I don't know if that defense was real he's obviously like he's a scoring shoots threes  but  maybe his percent his field goal percentage isn't that great I think he was he's perfect from the line yeah yesterday  it was a night 8 point spread by the way thanks Victor  if that was a fluke or not I think you picked this guy up totally Vince Williams up I think you think about picking Santi aldama up I think you think about thinking Jacob Gilyard up I think you think about picking Luke Kennard up because he doesn't mean six weeks John Moran season Steven Adams season who's the other six weeks Mart Marcus Smart six weeks  they're all gone like everything's gone Jerry Jackson Jr it is probably the next guy to get shut down the minute he tweaks a leg or a back or anything um  and I just think we're going to see kids playing for this team the rest of the way so  yeah so we ranked the Memphis pickups  we did  you want to Rattle off your list from top to bottom  my top to bottom is Vince  then Gigi then Santi aldama  then Luke Kennard then Jacob Gilyard  and then David Roddy and it looks like I don't know can I was in there I thought I go Vince  GG Obama Kennard Gillard rowdy  cool  that's a good list I go Tillman and Williams tied for the top I think Xavier Tillman looks solid  yes  and then yes he didn't know but he got some defensive stuff I mean it's you know for me for my team that's all I need then Gigi then Canard aldama and then Gilyard  Williams looks so solid though  yeah I jumped on him early and I'm really glad I did I stand I should have Xavier Tillman somewhere on my list because he was playing well he's another guy just add him to the mix  I wish they were playing tonight we just go pick them all up like everyone I'm be fun  I'm lucky the only are in our league is notoriously like we don't do a lot of Trades but I was lucky that I got a trade pulled off  my JJJ for broken Lopez who just fits my team build better and this was before John went down it was after Marcus went down before I went down and I'm happy that I got that done  so that I don't know JJ he's in my Panic list but  who knows what's gonna happen with him he is kind of a panic at the sky at this point and when you did that trade I'm like I don't really love that JJ Jackson Jr for Brook Lopez sort like the guy that keeps yelling at me on Twitter when I say that I'd rather have chat then Jayson Tatum  Tatum sounds better on paper but yet chats chats hiring right than he is and Brook Lopez man just he won't go away he never goes away he just keeps hanging around and yeah I mean I feel like Triple J is kind of a ticking Time Bomb there so probably a good move by you talk about your dabs Korean 26 kaminga  free coming at 20 and 11  congratulations to Jaron green on his return from a  extended absence with his triple single  yeah seven boards forces  are you worried about  my guy Podge with Draymond back you know I'm not because I think he's  he's such a spark and he's really showing that like he can  do a lot of things when he's in the game that I think courage is going to keep giving him a minute he's going to find minutes for him  and  yeah I mean I wouldn't drop Jim ski I think  Trace is over Trace days are over I think kaminga is back to just the old kaminga where he's just  just points  but  I think Draymond I mean I'm happy the draymond's back because I have Steph Curry on my team and stuff is just way better which I'm on there  and Draymond does these things that are just only dream on can do like that one where he  he kept the ball alive you know at the end of that quarter or something yesterday and I mean he just he's so smart and he's and he sees all these things happening and he frees up stuff and  so I'm glad he's back  just for the sake of stuff but  I don't know I realized I don't think I realized how dependent on Draymond Green stuff Curry's game is  like big time dependent and he can't he can't get his own  stuff with out dream on being in there helping him out it's weird um  Chris Jackson Davis did nothing yesterday that makes me sad  yeah 27 minutes yeah so and I think I'm gonna get that  yeah I think it's gonna get like 25 minutes he's gonna he's gonna find those minutes for him because he's he's a Difference Maker  maybe kind of like a six-man type  I don't know  and Wiggins  I don't know he might still have some minimum I mean it's all dependent on the trade I think the dubs are gonna do some trade deadline and it's weird watching the team  knowing that everyone's on the Block except for stuff it's weird creepy feeling which I'm not used to having but  I think the guys are still going to ball out as much as best as they can every game you know they they fight they fight in every game  so it's also weird seeing Andrew Wiggins be so bad for this long I mean I I really thought he was gonna have a good year and it's just been a disaster all the entire year  it's confounding I think there's just mental stuff going on yeah um Yuri I'm going to read this FanDuel copy what a vandal why don't you read through some of those comments dig through some of those comments I have a few feeling a

bless his heart is in there answering a lot of questions so thanks Victor I think somebody was wondering about  siakam  for Miles Bridges or miles bridges for yeah come nine cat if you find it click on it and it'll post it up on the screen we can talk about it  I think I can do that maybe yeah you might not be able to yeah Don sicario 811 a.m. I'm gonna go with this one first okay  Drake Cooper's worried that someone's gonna pick up Vince Williams  shot drop Kevin her for him or wait until the game starts  that is a great question right there  well one why did they have Kevin hurt her is it just for streaming the beginning of the week is six there's only six games tonight nobody's playing  so you I I would I if I had Kevin heard her I would not want to drop him until the game started tonight  but you're right Kevin her has not if you added him for the game then obviously like I don't I wouldn't waste my ad I would see that ad through but  um  that's tough  I don't know man I mean I think Vince Williams is is more guaranteed than her  like one game of Vince Williams might be worth  all of Kevin harter's games I don't know  I wonder if  he was leaving for watching watching this podcast and they're like oh I know Drake you were gonna go to go then Williams I don't mean it's not his real name I would rather have Vince Williams  by a mile  but I get  that you may need the gameplay from Kevin Harter tonight so so tough call we've got roughly what seven hours to wait that out if your league is Savvy and they make moves oh wouldn't Vince already begun  he should already be gone I've had him for two weeks  so  if you still out there now he may still be out there at  10 days and like a 10 Team league or an 18 League or something maybe  was it miles bridges for caca  yeah I think that's so can anyone  anybody that rosters miles get him and like trade them  because I don't know I feel like I have miles on my team I picked him off off waivers when he was nearing coming back and I just don't think anybody would take him  in our league  I don't know  and he offered him  I haven't  he's been pretty quiet  all right he's been balling he's been playing good he's been playing good but he hasn't been playing better since then some ball came back so I'm gonna wait and see how that shakes out  all right I'm just gonna answer this question if I can trade miles Bridges to get Pascal siakam I'm doing it yeah you do it I agree absolutely and ask him is gonna get traded I don't know where to hopefully Atlanta that would be awesome  he's gonna get traded and then he's gonna keep balling out all year so um  if you can trade bridges for siakam you just do it you don't even  you don't even think about it  I got a question because you brought this up on on your pod a couple weeks ago where I floated you Zach LaVine for Donte divincenzo and who we both still still own how I feel about that now yeah how do you feel about that now not great  is it Levine is look good  he's looking and Dante isn't good he's the green Levine is look good you said he's look good I thought you said Levine is love good look good that's even better um  well he does look good  Dante gives me what my building needs more than Levine though so  I don't know let's let's keep doing on that one um I told my son to check his trade offers and he asked me last night if herb Jones for who was it  Bradley Beal Bradley Beal was a good trade I said  I've heard worse  I think there's like a lot of people that would tell you to run out and make that deal if you're soaring  because  like camel and I when we talk about herb Jones she's just kind of like yeah  her Jones doesn't really move the needle for me and Brad Beal caught fire  and he looked really good for a stretch there and maybe he still does look really good right now I mean  he's in my top player list yeah I think I think that's a trade I would probably make  well it's gone now foreign oh did you pull it already I did okay um let's answer this question and you can wrap up with the notes you did cuz I didn't that other stuff that Panic meter and stuff that's more for like one Ken and I do this and I knew we were going to be out of time by the inside and doing anything but we'll do we'll go over your hot list or your Panic meter in your hot list I have three Grizzlies on my roster Luke Kennard Xavier Tillman GG Jackson  I don't know if that's something okay or not and that's from a dude he's on here every week he's loyal loyal supporter of this podcast how do you feel about having a bunch of dudes on the same team Yuri  it's a risk you know but I think the Grizzlies is one of those teams right now where you can do that you can get away with that  I saw Bob in the sandwich had like three or four Raptors on his team which I thought was really weird and odd from Bob but  yeah I think I think you're all right at DIA in his weird 15 cat leaked  I love cats yes the weird 15 catley all right can we talk about my buddy Frank wants to know your thoughts on Keegan Murray oh absolutely  where is Frank  he's 8:53 just he's at the bottom  like New Orleans  Frank  yeah there's Frank  Frank says anything to say about Keegan Murray you know what I don't have Keegan Murray on any of my rosters me neither I think of him as like a 3-point specialist kind of guy more than  anything any he'll have those occasional games as you know where he just blows up  and looks like he's ready to take over the world like Jalen Johnson and then he just kind of  Fades back away into the background right after that so um  I like him I think he's gonna be I think he's gonna be a really good player I think we might  might be a year or two early on Keegan Murray right now  but I again  I haven't studied him and it's taking me forever to pull up his game log here I feel like the Kings the Kings will reassess during the break and yeah guys like King and Marie might come alive after the break Frank  someday 19 minutes 4 points but he got hurt in that game right I think he heard his hip so that was before that he put together three really good games in a row so I feel like he was coming on sort of like Tori Eason and I totally interrupted you Yuri I'm sorry um he was coming on like Tori Eason and now he's hurt so we don't even know if he's gonna play tonight carry on I'm sorry no it's all right I I was done with my thought all right so let's see we got four minutes so my Panic meter guys the Anthony Melton  I'm really worried about back issues back issues in general and  based on my weird-ass build he's my top ranked player so I'm I'm really worried about losing dancing  I also you know I drafted Ben Simmons Bradley Beal so like the back issues really scaring me  that can on my lip yeah you I mean I think yeah if you does come back I'm I think it's going to be easy to be limited a lot  Ben Simmons heard that name in a minute how's he doing  he's still he's still riding Pine he's still getting paid people are still holding on him hoping that he comes back but geez I I dropped him months ago the Triple J is on your list Jared Jackson year you know I think that yeah we kind of covered that so instead of you know I think lately he's lost a little bit of that Joy I mean I hate to say it but like  Timmy Hardaway Jr is giving me more what I need than Steph is but you know I I love I'm dubs die hard so that's crazy dude that you have more faith and Tim Hardwood Junior right now  that's bad but I think with dream on back I think Steph's going to be back to his old self a little bit more I hope Steph Curry's not watching this he's gonna be very upset he knows like his number one fan is like  kind of kind of bombing all right who you got down in your heartless I just got two guys and they're both sons players so  you know Grayson Allen Tim Ted Cruz's son from another mother her game he's ranked 44th in the last month yeah he's averaging fourteen point nine points three triples three point eight rebounds 2.8 assists 1.1 steals 0.9 blocks 50% fuel goal 93% free throw like and he's not needing much usage to do it he's so consistent and clutch and when they were without bill it's like Grace and Allen I never thought I would love Grayson Allen but I love Grayson Allen he's been so solid  dude I love Grayson Allen this year like I but is he going away because of your other hot player  because abiel yeah he hasn't been I mean I think he's had a couple Duds but I think he's really important to that that team so I think he's gonna plug in where he he can if he's not scoring he'll be doing in defensive side so  I still love him for that and then Bradley Beal my other hot player so I was expecting a zero him riding on my bench so I'm very happy with what he's done since he's been back so  over the nine games per game he's been he's ranked 74th  averaging 20 points 6 points 4.3 rebounds 4.3 assists 1.83 and then I love the defense like one steal and point four blocks  and his percentages have been good too so I'll take it you know I'm still trying to trade them I'm not unhappy with him on my team  well moving while you can now that's that's the best advice I give Bradley Beals names like his leg I don't trust his legs let alone his back but um Grayson Allen he kind of reminds me of Donte divincenzo they started to do the same stuff  there's nothing flashy they're not gonna score a ton of points usually  occasionally they will but I feel like they're  sort of in the same realm but um yeah looking back on that I kind of wish I would have given you Dante didn't even shenzo and taking taking Zack Levine off your hands although  this Levine things not over yet if he doesn't get traded out of Chicago and  I don't know that would be a disaster I think they were unable to move him  well now I know you're interested so  it's good I mean it's not even Shinzo  right I'll give you I'll give you Dante Davidson for grace and Allen let's do that all right we are over the one hour mark which I try not to do  you're just a super fun having you on really fun we do it again sometime hopefully  since wrote a virus so cool about letting me pick my own guess who I have lined up for the next one do I know yet oh it might be Raphael Raphael Johnson who I used to work with at NBC know he's great um and then it looks like Jonas  nice and Kenny crates the K train back in the saddle and then Rick Cameron I will be here this Thursday to break down everything that happens on Wednesday night  during any any last words you need to say goodbye to Victor or any of your people here you've got no thanks everyone for showing up today guys and supporting us and Steve thanks for having me on and good luck in your mat who are you matched up against this week  in our league  so Mark Smith the picking her males me I am against Brian  always a good matchup with Brian Brian Rose worthless yeah I love I love playing him he's falling he's got he's got a good team only better than this was Auto draft Rick and Malcolm us man freaking mouth I got to talk to him at length about that at his Christmas party yeah yeah he's like LeBron he's got Cadiz he's got like all these that Kyrie he's Kawaii he's got all the old dudes that are balling out this year he's got all of that nobody wanted that now decided that they're never gonna miss another basketball game yeah I mean genius strategy just if you know you're picking first just go Auto draft because you'll get value and that's what he got so ridiculous well good luck against Brian and we'll see you next time all right bye
