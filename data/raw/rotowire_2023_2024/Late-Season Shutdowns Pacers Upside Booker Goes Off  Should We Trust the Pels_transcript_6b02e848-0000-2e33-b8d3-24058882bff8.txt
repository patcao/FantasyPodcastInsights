hey everybody Dre here with the K Train The Legend Ken Crites this is the Tuesday April 2nd RotoWire basketball podcast  can I cut off your your whistle please blow the whistle  you're a kind soul for letting you know so it drives whaling crazy if there's one thing I should have learned this year doing this with you eight times or however many did it I don't mess with the catering and his whistle like  nobody nobody a fan sent me this whistle I had a small whistle at like a local Carpenter was like that's not a whistle I'm sending you a whistle and he sent me this massive anyway oh thank you thank you I love that was so we're not driving right in San Antonio  Devin vassell done for the years Jeremy so in done for the year are you wearing about Wendy like why are they going to keep playing Wendy right well those usually hurt right  I understand and you're always on the wemby watch because you've got a championship Squad  if we are in we are in week two of our matchup in a three week  go down in my 30 Team league I've got  wimpy out there I couldn't rely on Rashawn Holmes after what he did to me last week so I've got cheddy Osman out there  yeah his minutes should climb I've got Zach Collins out there  they're all playing tonight supposedly I just pray that when he is playing um  can I rely on Teddy Osmond he's awesome and gonna help me win a 30 Team league well I'm just a 30 Team league how many who's available right but  the minute should be there where the man she mentioned with real injuries is so haunted and vessel  gosh somebody's got a play and  you know he's not part of their future if he rolls his ankle or whatever I don't think they really care uh which I guess is a good thing I guess Branham  might be the biggest but yeah their playing champagne yeah he might he might Silly Season baby  I don't know I know I survived last week with a 5-4 win with only like three minutes out of Rashawn Holmes so in sheddy played good in his last game he got to start he's shoes he's not shy right like he gets the ball shoot it yeah I just threw out there um so anyway if if you're in a deeply and you're looking for a warm body this week  cheddy might be a guy to throw in in their tonight and see what happens all wins the you know going doll with guys who just have minutes who you dislike  but get minutes that's the way to win these silly season matchups you know I went for it with Tyrese Maxey on Sunday and camel is League  and I wasn't able to be there right at the confirmation lineup so I said I'm going maxi  he doesn't play I lose by two assists I get two assists I'm in the finals again with Kamala no I should have gone boring and put like Doreen Smith in there some god-awful oh  that's terrible yeah if I went through all this work this year and I don't win 30 deep I've got I've got the best lineup I'm gonna be  I'm gonna be devastated man I'm gonna be I hear you I mean seven leagues  one is stakely we got to get you in the Roto wire stake League  I'm in the money for that I made playoffs for so I'm playoffs for five of seven finals for three of seven  once the fsga where they give you the the championship ring at the fsga conference and you're on stage and everyone you beets in the audience want to get against Dan Titus Yahoo for that out looks bad but  now I'm just rambling I'm sorry I cut off your actual news headline which is Devin vessel Jeremy Sohan shut down for the season you actually reminded me of speaking of getting up in front of people and accepting Awards with my whole Hall of Fame thing I was talking to Andy Behrens I'm like so are you flying me to Vegas and I you know awarded on the stage and everything like no are you in the radio show are they going to have you on serious we did that we did that okay so we did we did that little thing which was very fast and then I said well I need to know what my hall of fame thing is going to be am I getting a jacket and we getting a plaque and I getting a bronze statue like big bust yeah bust and he's like yeah it's gonna be like a combination of all three of those and we'll send it to you ASAP I'm probably never going to get anything but I can at least  I always get in my head fsga in the fs W Awards they are confusing I know shanky has plaques for both so I think you're getting at least a plaque okay  all right so Brandon Ingram of the Pelicans  sound like he was shutting it down for the regular season but now he's talking about coming back then finished the season despite his knee injury um so make sure he's not sitting out there he could go off next week I think Ingram is an excellent example though the sexy versus boring meaning yeah if engrams in  hege upside right but why I had assumed they'd have him on a restriction this week right and then give him a tune-up next week before the actual playoffs the Pelicans aren't really playing for anything I should get my stand they are sort of playing for something where are they just got passed by the Mavericks  oh yes but it made me more worrisome though for them they're only one game ahead of the sons for the plan so you're right actually and that's a bad example Ingram is somebody they'll probably max out if they can  you're right doc well and also this year is weird Ken because Jared Jackson Jr still at their balling out Desmond's Bane  like there's tons of guys Brandon Clark came back like people were playing who I mean we never thought would be playing right Jackson supposed to be a 50 game guy a year right outside he's like the old he's the Cal Ripken of the Memphis Grizzlies here LeBron James is out there at 39 years old and he hasn't missed minigames it's not right why Leonard it's just a weird and there's a lot of a lot of guys are not shutting it down  this year like they have in the past I think this commissioner moved to  incentivize guys to keep playing as working going off on the coaches it's wearing off on the players and it's working and then of course you got a guy like Damian Lillard oh yeah right the new headline move to your new headline there yeah personal reasons on Saturday and now a groin injury will keep him out on Tuesday  I mean if you're in if in a finals of a fantasy league and you've got Dame Lillard right now like he could not have done this at a worst time ever know he couldn't I hope and there's land the groin aren't related and there's no one  there's no one in Milwaukee you can really replace him with unless  Malik Beasley or Hammerman Philadelphia you know we've got some live questions stocks we go to the questions  yeah why not Christian Rogers regular the show he wants to know about the Myles Turner you know he messed up his finger I think only played 14 minutes last night  let me pull this up on RotoWire I don't think it's a right finger injury  and we just don't know anything more you know he left the game didn't didn't play through it not come back yeah Jalen Smith had a double-double shooting hand two side imagine they're going to be nervous about it  Jalen Smith is the pickup there if Turner misses time which  this type of year the Pacers are kind of locked into where they are I would I want Turner healthy for the playoffs well I'll say this though he only one game back of the Pacers that you know if I'm Indiana I sure heck want to avoid that plans so  that on the plane plane yeah they're only one game ahead of the heat for six to avoid the plan oh but I'm sorry Christian we don't have any new news yet I'm sure wrote a wire will have it today but as of 11 a.m. eastern nothing new on Turner it is a shooting hand so it's a concern and they do have jail in Smith a good backup  so I think every reason to be nervous there  I I would be surprised at Miles Turner plays in his next game okay you heard it from the doctor there all right next question from Matt who would you drop in a points League G Williams or meet you out in Charlotte throw that up on the screen G oh Grant Williams Grant Williams yeah sorry both Charlotte guys yeah yeah who would I pick up  or who would I dropping a point Sleek I think I draw I drop meets it just because you Grant Williams is starting and he's scoring right now I think Grant Williams is good to go the rest of the way I I'm actually got him written down as a guy that should be picked up I also think meet you is right there with him as far as a guy who's available in a ton of leaks who should be picked up but just in a in a points League I think I trust William's a little bit more than I do meet  yeah yeah I mean a road only gets obvious she just go with whatever category you need to question there but those two are both going to get a ton of minutes and the seasonal was debating last night's calibrating the Celtics like what's me just rolled next year for Charlotte  I wonder if they're gonna he could be their starting shooting guard or Rose ear gone  well see 31 though next season so I don't know he's had a heck of a year man  he's a great guy to take a flyer on a keeper leaks for next year you know he  go ahead he hit a wall last week and had like two bad games in a row and everybody panicked and he's been right back right back to his old tricks today so this week all right I got a really hard question I'm going to put on the screen because too many names  but loyal family Luke wants to know  which two to stream for days for Saturday boy  GG Jackson getting on I mean it's not shooting as much  Paul Reed brought out in Denver Cameron Payne we just talked about totally depends on Max's Health Fernando getting some minutes for your Hawks  surprisingly I don't know why he did have a nice Revenge game against the Celtics those two wins you got any problems on these six times I'm going with trending Watford and Gigi Jackson Paul Reed should be done with him be probably back by then  Brown campaign Bruno I don't really trust any of them I know I know Gigi's gonna get 30 and I know trending watt for had  bloody have last night he had like he had a great game I've got he did trying to guess who's gonna be awesome for Portland is  dangerous  no don't know Benton  Delano's the man he did not ban another 35 minutes off the bench he's the silly season MVP band he is 265 and 5 last night with five stocks maybe the Celtics didn't make a smart move let him go oh he's never gonna get 35 minutes a run for Boston but that's  the silly season MVP slash hero like it really is you really is and I picked him up I had him in on team I've got him on team that kind of win a championship in and he is he's been awesome that was star my camel like all right one more question here would you drop booch the Bulls for Fernando Lara I say no I know he said some low scoring games but  he's got to be talking yeah who's yeah I mean just I mean look at 14 rebsamen  is going to play every minute the Bulls desperate  I wouldn't drop food at all  I not for Kyle Lowry or Bruno Fernando especially yeah so yeah let's just hang on to the Future and let's let's hear news out there that I don't know about that's  kind of weird as crazy oh I'll check for news once you get give us the next headline on the notes sir  um  she goes Alexander if he for tonight with a quad injuries so keep an eye on the road to wire news feed their um your guy Tyrese Maxey might not be ready for Tuesday  Lowry was solid Joel embiid we thought was coming back on Tuesday he's not he's not in weird sham woes racing in about just turning this week complain tonight Tuesday like immediately said he's not playing Tuesday  so I have actually a Thursday pickup in the fsga championship oh boy it's a daily moves leak butt is down to game count  so I'm debating dropping  I gotta drop someone from bead but then if he doesn't play Thursday his next game what is his next game  I mean I don't know why you'd write he's got two B ready talk about teams that don't have much to play for  Phillies got five they're up four and a half games on the Bulls for the 8th spot  they're kind of stuck in the plane  I don't know there's really not much need to rush him back so I assume if they're going to play embiid it's you know he's healthy right because there's not much to play for but we'll find out what it means one of those things where I don't feel bad for telling people to drop him even if he comes back because I don't need to come back and play like crazy minutes um and we've only got like six games seven games left or whatever so um but it will be disturbing that if you drop them in your opponent picked him up and he does come back and goes off that's gonna be that's still all right things are bad in Washington right doc yeah tell me how to  tell me about it how to get tonight second straight absence do a heel issue ties Jones is out for Washington what's the latest Holmes hasn't returned yet either  Denny could just go off he might be the only walking wizard it might be five on one tonight Corey kispert everything he should be gunning special if you need threes both of them Denny and core gifts for both can be out there gunning gunning give us the good news in Memphis stock  um Brandon Clarke playing for the Grizzlies eating up some of Gigi's minutes and and some of his stuff  and 15 and 7 last night with three three combined steals blocks still brand bench  23 minutes yeah he's really producing Off the Bench I think they want to boost his confidence gone over a year  I tell you what I don't know who's pulling the strings in Memphis but whoever is  is like hey if you can play You're Gonna Play get out there and play I don't care who you are Jared Jackson Jr had what like 40 last night with yeah yeah all this stuff and I'm playing good yeah you know who should be lighting it up for them as now he's missed his 11th game Vince Williams he was awesome  and then what is a plantar fasciitis I think I don't know but  I had Williamson like every League I didn't I was rolling him so hard for so long and he got he kind of got a Clips by Delon I think I think Benton has been more of a fantasy hero than Vince's oh yeah and now that it's all said and done given the silly is there a silly season trophy for MVP I don't it's in the mail it's in the mail it's with your Hall of Fame boss with my hall of fame package my hall of fame starter kit  so yeah I'll let you all know what that looks like when that when that shows up in Alabama and Silly Season award arrives at my home  but tell us tell us about it Utah your former Hawk John Collins he's it looks like he's out again right back issues I guess so um okay Ken is you noted in these notes that I'm totally stealing from they need a bottom 10 finish to save their first round pick or goes to okay see  the Jazz lost time straight cama cama called this uh Utah Jazz shut down and tank at the start of the Season Laurie Markin and gone John Collins probably gone Walker Kessler they decided to start benching him on day one and never stopped like what a misusage of Walker Kessler this year I mean they gave funk you away for free to Detroit it's almost like we're a little worried Simone might my play well so we gotta get him out of here this is like a shop  like they chopped funk you up into a bunch of Chick-fil-A bites of chicken and just stood at the mall and gave it away  right there in the food court you know yeah we haven't seen Jordan Clarkson and I don't know how long so yeah it's rough and so who does that leave that that leaves that one dude that I picked up for a minute who's that no name Taylor  well tell her Hendricks is the rookie that they what is he like 18 years old or 12 I think that's the guy they want to be giving him a gazillion minutes  he's only appeared in 33 games this year I think he might got it yeah he's been over 20 yeah he's been starting since late February he's been over 20  over 25 24 minutes  since starting  big double double guy not getting you know  I was not going to hit me three well he had forth oh my goodness  he's actually jacking up threes as of late so he could be a nice blocks  rebounds three combo and yeah they're good for  we've got keonte George Bryce sends the ball and Taylor Hendricks like those are the guys that  you're still making me right now those are the moves  yeah Hendrix might be available in some League's but  they're all I mean he's not going to be available anywhere but they're letting Sexton gun  and realizing  feral Hendrix is Taylor Hendricks is only Ross in 17% of Yahoo leaks so yeah he's always scored in double digits one time in his last six games so it's not like he's out there just blowing it up but he is hitting three-pointers he's getting some rebounds and he is he is getting some blocks and some steals like he's worth a look and if Collins is out tonight exactly Collins gone no marketing he's gonna get paints his the pain is his and I don't understand whether purposely tanking Walker Kessler's career I know they're upset with Kessler's inability to switch and I'm like that's an old school Center why you've got him on Perimeter guys as Beyond me but maybe that's the new MBA I don't know maybe Kessler's should have been born 20 years ago  you have a crane he  you have a cranky old get off my lawn man segment I do thank you why not call you can't  oh I didn't hear that I put it on the internet like him this lady here's what I'm angry about doc this whole silly sees him people not playing it's disgusting Gary Trent he's played in 66 games for the Raptors this season 28 minutes a game he's young he's sitting tonight for rest purposes what did you know John Stockton had 16 seasons one six 16 Seasons where he played the max 82 games plus playoffs that includes his last four seasons when he was aged 37 to 40 in fact when Stockton was 40 years old he played in 82 games and averaged 28 minutes per game at age 40 Michael Jordan with the Wizards played 82 games and over 30 minutes of contest but 25 year old Gary Trenton needs a rest damn you silly season absurd  I love the fact he just called him Gary Trenton  after I just called you Kent  I am famous on the Friday pod for mispronouncing names I know it's Trent I don't know why I said you know just the anger the anger pushed me to miss pronounce well when you're when you're on your out in your yard with a garden  hose trying to spray kids riding by on their bikes and yelling at them it's easy to mispronounce words I was gonna put that up there because oh sorry sorry I'm good this up there because when Michael Chang asked that question about vooch  um it was based on schedule so boots may only play one game and those are guys played two during that run which would have been helpful to know in the question but not not that we care well he's gonna play that one game what I would hate is you do something do what I did this Sunday pick up a Gary Trent thinking oh look at that nice High game count just so they rest the 25 year old  you try to get cute and you get burned like that's what I mean like I've been ranting and raving about how incredible Rashawn Holmes was those two weeks leading up to last week and I'm like he's saving my season he's gonna win me 30 d i  mean he played like eight minutes and on Monday got hurt and we never saw him again  yeah which is been a problem for like two months so I'm not I'm not mad at him for getting hurt I think he is hurt but the timing of it was was pretty bad and now I'm relying on Zack Collins and cheddy Osman and Yamaha to save my saved 30 team leaked I mean you're gonna have to pick up your CD Osmonds you know there's no  Taylor Hendricks ain't so I didn't pick him up did I he's been on my roster all year he's a hot commodity in 30  all right we're glad he's there are we gonna have last night's games I guess that was my cranky old man I'm just mad at I'm just mad at Sean Holmes  so talk about your Celtics for a second yeah they beat the Hornets they basically are playing  the rest of the season out with one hand tied behind their back right and maybe also in a sack of potatoes a potato sack as they just on and toy with these teams or blow 30 point lead against the Hawks or what exactly they had a couple of bad ones but yeah they don't care the Celtics as far as fantasy goes is now all about being in a daily if you're in a daily move League or not where you can take him in and out of your lineup and you're available at five you know roughly five to six thirty PM Eastern Time to make last second adjustments because Brown's going to get some rest Tatum is going to get some rest Persian Big Al are going to get some rest you don't know when that's going to happen frankly Luke Cornett if you've got benched room to stash cornet when he starts he has five starts this year he gets a double double with two and a half blocks but it's only when he starts and he's gonna start one game between now and the end but when that game occurs who knows Howser any night can just easily drain five threes with his eyes closed he's probably the lead guy to get unless you need dimes then Pritchards Gonna Get You More assists  but there's going to be some daily transaction All Stars  where these guys have one Delano Bentonite but then the next night give you like five and four and you're like what am I doing so weekly League's the Celtics are awfully awfully risky but if you're in a daily League hate Payton Pritchard Sam Houser even more Cornett a great stashes because they will blow up when they start  and the real question is why would anyone be in a weekly lineup league in 2024  I mean they're old well you know the belief is it's less work but then you're so angry when it's Thursday and you know half your lineups out you can't do anything about it I know all seven of my 30 Team guys go on Sunday so that is going to be really frightening but let's talk about Sam Houser for Santa are you aware  are you aware of who his high school teammate was  oh it would be up in Wisconsin because I know he grew up in Wisconsin but it would also be someone more Virginia would be a tyranny caliber what's the time it would be someone under the RotoWire umbrella it would be a co-worker of ours get out  get out I have no I hear you record really  I don't play high school ball played high school ball with Sam Houser  that's fantastic you know that I mean Wisconsin is the thing yeah a lot of people forget Hauser played Marquette before he transferred to Virginia before he became a sniper developing sniper for the Celtics but sprecker  I did not know he played high school ball okay and he was talking to me about Sam Houser like two months ago yeah I went to high school with him and he's a good player and I was like I'm not really falling for this 25 points 739 of 13 last night like in Mark Brown and or Jayson Tatum sit out I think you know how you're in your lineup and let him rip absolutely and I don't think Tatum and and brown will play a game together again until maybe the very end or in the playoffs right Brown sat last night absolutely they want to spread the burden out let those guys rest  you know the best thing that happened is Sam Houser was Max Drew's hurting his knee when he screws believe way back away stress was a two-way guy for the Celtics  blew his knee out South said bye he picked him up and the rest is history for Max Drew's but then the Celtics were like what we need our Max Drew's  three-point specialist development guy comes cheap and so Howser moved right into that spot  K training why does Drew holiday hate fantasy basketball and managers  he yeah because man he makes the extra pass which they love them on the team for but boy he does not go for the goddess stats you sure would like uh yeah D white really nobody thought D white would have the better fantasy season than Duality this year though I was all over Drew I was on every sleeper list I had I got my neighbor roster I could but you know it's really white who's the point guard on offense and they send holiday to the corner so many plays or they LED brown or Tatum dribble the ball top of the key but holiday is not really a point guard anymore you could almost say he's like a 3D Wing who's just a little short  well and we all would have been a lot better off had he just not played  on Monday he got your Monday off to one of 11 shooting stars he had two points and two assists he missed all of his three-pointers  and white open he missed some white open once to well you know his shoulder injury and you can see he's wearing that weird sleeve on one arm and a shoulder thing on the other is dead shoulder  is a legit injury and I think that they're worried about getting him back in a Groove before the playoffs some of these other ones like brown sitting last night I think that's just rest but of all the weird sittings playing for Celtics holidays I think the most legit injury well I I just feel bad for people people who had them in their lineup I've gotten very used to Payton Pritchard being out there and playing 30 minutes for me and my 300 Drew's back so he's kind of messing that up he's just he's just messing everything up and you know what he's gonna keep messing it up because defense is so good they leave him out there right he's their best offender so even last night when he's shooting that terrible one of 11 he was still playing great D helping get turnovers and stuff and they'll put them on power forwards and he's kind of like Kyle Lowry on their block he is a fairly immovable for a guard  so yeah I would keep avoiding holiday I don't think his numbers are going to shine it'll be more Awkward than not rest of the season  what do you make of  Jalen Duren getting a tooth knocked out last night  leaving the game for good they lose the Memphis at home how sad is that that like at home you can't even beat Memphis they got Cunningham in the lineup they got ivy in the lineup five minutes in  well and I can see whether like if you're in any pain this season's over who cares but there was like a home's move there during  man he's a rebound machine when he's in there he's a rare future piece for that team well if Jared Jackson took one of my teeth out the impact of that hitting my face that elbow or whatever it was I'd probably be dead right now so yeah  at the very least you'd be crying like little babies is okay as far as we know but to me she means he me too at 7 points and eight boards James Wiseman had 10 and 10 we don't really know what they're in is going to do if he misses another game or misses time I I see you roll James Wiseman oh really I'm actually tempted more for me too frankly I think well that too yeah  there's a joke in there somewhere yeah yeah me too  tell us about your your pace is it because you know you grew up in Indiana your Pacers Nets game last year that that's what a terrible season and there's old trending a lot for it I yeah I was like what team who she played for is what I have the United I always remember last for us yes Portland last year I screwed it up I did not realize he'd gone over to Brooklyn this is when we all start to sound like Charles Barkley in the Silly Season when guys are hasn't played All Seasons suddenly they're getting massive minutes the Nets are so boring and so forgettable that you don't even know who's on their team  and it makes sense but the Pacers got 27 and 13 at Halliburton Jalen Smith had a double-double because Myles Turner got hurt TJ McConnell had 10 points and eight assists in 18 minutes backing up Halliburton he's he actually might be better a better play right now than Payton Pritchard just because he's more effective in shorter stints if you holidays going to keep playing I'm on my channel I'm sorry I say yeah TJ McConnell might be better yeah a better backup to play point guard to play right now then Payton Richard  maybe I mean yeah you're right he certainly does play better in short stints the Pacers are not going to rest Halliburton until they're assured or whether they know they can get past the heat to stay out of the plan yeah I'm not saying they're gonna rest how I feel like McConnell gets run the Cockroach gets run and he gets steals too  we've been calling him the Cockroach for years on Friday you cannot kill McConnell's career he will not go away but for pickups though in Daily leagues if this Myles Turner injury or finger injuries real and you don't think he's gonna play Jalen Smith could be a delicious pickup for a one game run him and Isaiah Jackson both and it's a coin flip you know you don't know which one's gonna  be better than the other but one of them is probably going to go off  yeah I think Smith's a little more of a shooter I would lean to Smith if you're debating but you're right it could be I'm with you on that I like I like Smith better as well and then from the Nets came Johnson was out with the toe injury  the Nets didn't even put up a fight with the Trey young list Hawks to try to get in the play in and he's let the Hawks have it a friend and walk forward yeah is that a gift you really want that was like there they was playing golf and here they are playing golf and we had the golf cart right up kind of close to the close to the green when we probably should have been and the old man I'm playing with is like  hey Steve I'm gonna let you I'm gonna let you get the car I'm gonna let you ride I'm like okay so he walks like five feet to his ball and now I gotta drive like a mile bass word all the way up a mountain all the way back around the green and then I've got 20 yards thanks buddy  but yeah the play it is that a gift she really want you know it's not really I mean coach Quinn is he there next year I mean how many coaches can they go through before they realized that maybe trailer wrong is your stars the problem you know really thought I really thought coach Quinn was gonna be good for the Hawks but  it's just hasn't been in that good all right so what do they do this offseason Atlanta you know you're living in Georgia there they're not gonna keep just trying to make Gene Murray and young work Murray goes I sure sure went off on myself to Young's not around sure like Murray's defense a lot better than Young  why do you keep these two when do you admit that the given up Don's for young was  well you're never going to admit that  when are you going to admit that trying to run Don sherr trying to run the jaunty and Trey up there together  is a failed experiment it's time when are you gonna admit that that Jalen Johnson needs all the forward minutes and we don't really need  old man bogey by Donna we don't need City Bay we don't need the Andre Hunter we don't need kompella we just run it out there there there's a lot of things the Hawks have a lot of pieces they can move and they having a lot of small forwards is not a terrible thing how hard is that Hunter contract to move I think it next year's the last year right or is there more I'm not sure yeah I'm a famous guy I'm not a real contract somebody who knows something about math  yeah they I think I think Hunters probably gone I think capella was probably John and then  something's got to give with Trey and Deontay and I don't know  I don't know if they're gonna trade trade or I don't know if they're going to trade dejounte  I feel like the marketing department would want to try trade deshante but the coaching Department should trade Trae young in his terrible defense  it's gonna be interesting it's gonna be an interesting summer in Atlanta one way or the other and what other week what are we got a review here magic Blazers how does the magical only win that game by one I don't understand that how do they how are they as good as they are they're you know box scores you looked at the lineups look at Wendell Carter still starting at Center they try to get rid of him a petite so that didn't work the yeah actually good line for Carter last night but  it's such an uninspiring lineup Greg Harris getting started again my goodness  what is they need to Blazers like what is what is DeAndre ayton still doing out there in 20 points at 12 boards  oh you know he's long-term contract I think they want to force a work ethic on the guy I'm not sure that a level work but you know they got him for a few more years so ah I think they want to try to make a leader out of them which might be asking too much  um we kind of talked about the Hawks enough that crunchy he had  fixed triples in 18 points I mean if you want to roll the dice on that guy here he is a real good luck he'll come back tomorrow with 0 points and two Jalen Johnson was highly disappointing in his return from his ankle injury or 12 shooting 11 points that was not much  and my man Toby white 8 of 21 shooting thanks buddy and then Andre Drummond 13.18 boards Off the Bench I don't know how he keeps doing that I don't know what you how you know when that's coming when you don't well how about all right what about the Pelicans just rolling over to the Suns last night in New Orleans that was to me every time people on talk about what a talented line at the Pelicans have I'm like show me a meaningful crunch time  Victory this team's had you know they're only what are their their only one game up on the Suns to avoid the play in well that was just such a deflating loss last night they had everybody playing  it's Trey Murphy's been hot actually Murphy had a good game  there they've they've they've given up on giving Valentine's meaningful shots he keeps coming out earlier and earlier for  Larry Nance  I but where are the Pelicans going they gonna the sun's gonna catch them  well I was worried about the Mavericks catching them the Mavericks have been behind them all year and now the Mavericks have passed him and our winning their division and our up to number five seed in the west only two games down the Clippers which helps Luke could you just MVP chance of right so you've got some cash on right yeah I need the MVP he can't do it the six or seven seed but can he do it as a 5th maybe and now the now the suns are coming after the Pelicans and speaking of the sons dude Devin Booker is scored 50 points against the sons in three straight games  against the Pelicans and pelicans have my defensive hero herb Jones why isn't Jones Garden him on every play I don't know but Devin don't care yeah honey badger he don't you know what  a game  Devin Booker has 640 point games this season he has 850 point games on this career in three of them have come against the Pelicans all back to back to back um so why wasn't Devin Booker in my FanDuel lineup last night like note to self when he goes home in New Orleans you put him in your lineup no matter what it costs and you want to hear another discussing stat for the Pelicans choking last night and this is this isn't just an outlier from last night this is a career long problem how many rebounds do you think Zion had any 37 minutes of run 37 minutes  power forward how many rebounds did he have left well I know he had five assists and I earmarked that because I knew he had less fewer rebounds than that so I'm going to go with two yeah two minutes you and I could get two rebounds I'm 37 minutes around that is just unexcusable so people love to talk about the Highlight Reel if you don't rebound who cares you know like and his size rebound I don't want to hear about the athleticism first of all I play like get your game count up but second rebound I love in auction League's Zion is one of my early names to go to because the reality is so far below the hype for Zion  his that's all my first go to in auction leaks to get it out there have other people spend money and that way is that the way you work in an auction generally speaking like drug guys you don't want early absolutely I am middle early in middle I throw out the biggest name I can find the guy for the guy I'm least lack least like me to actually draft right now sadly I would that was wimpy too for me which hmm that didn't work out so  I doubted his Gamecock I also doubted talk about guys who were not supposed to play a lot the did Kevin Durant  man how he's only missed like four or five games it's amazing at his age was he 37 I think I really thought this was the year Durant's game Count was a mess yeah I've and he's been in 68 games guys who drafted well guys and girls people who drafted old fantasy players this year did pretty well dominated LeBron 80 KD yeah the team I'm playing against in this F it's it's an fgsa thing I think I think I paid money to play in it whatever  it uh the dude I'm playing against has got LeBron James and Luka doncic and he's just rolling the league he finished first for the regular season I finished third but I need I need my guys to play I just I just lost them Massillon in that one too that that hurt but that I'm trying to win I'm still gonna try to win not giving up well I think we're at the magical 45 minute limit here have any give us one or one name for pickups I think mine's going to be jail in Smith  but if Turner's out but who's your one is it Hauser or who's your guy  um if  Jalen Brown is out or if the other guy Jayson Tatum is out it's it's damn Houser if Jalen during misses game I'm going James wise and you're going to Missy I mean to I'm gonna be um if Grant Williams is sitting out there I think that's the I want to pick up yeah there you go there you go  started Center last night  yeah the Richards is injured now too so Mark Williams boy what happened to his career we'll see what happens with him healthwise next year all right sir well the time to wrap it up with what our standard at
