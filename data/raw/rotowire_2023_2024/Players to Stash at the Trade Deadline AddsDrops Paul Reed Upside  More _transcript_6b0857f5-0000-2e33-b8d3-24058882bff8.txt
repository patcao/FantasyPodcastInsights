watching or listening to this pod you should probably be aware that things are not looking great for Joelle and bead you know we had the meniscus issue they were being a little cagey about it you know I think he had the MRI what back back on like last Tuesday or Wednesday and you know really wasn't until the end of the weekend that we got a firm update that came yesterday he's going to undergo a procedure to repair a left meniscus injury that was for Adrian motion roeske ESPN no time table but what was told us that he will miss and extended period of time do you have any guess what that means to you um no real I mean I think a month plus probably be tough to come back sooner than a month from meniscus surgery on the Friday podcast I was just not even acting like I do it was just saying it's a meniscus tear because it's clearly was but they keep saying like oh it needs a procedure to fix a flap and then all the all the all the legitimate Twitter doctors were like no I it's a torn meniscus he needs surgery it's that simple I don't know why they're be doing a PR campaign over over what this injury is but no I won't be surprised if he's out  if he's out basically through the rest of the regular season it's it's possible that you know he misses because I think some of the wording that was used and I can't remember it right now I think the board like repair he's already had a a menace activity I think it's pronounced where they shaved off part of his meniscus already this is yours ago um so that I don't think they can do that anymore or he's gonna run into like a Dwyane Wade situation where is just don't exist anymore huh yeah it's a brutal break for indeed you know we've been updating the MVP odds you know each week and I think he fell all the way down to around 50 to one right after the meniscus injury he's now off the board completely so you know obviously he's not going to meet the 65 game threshold so we can cross that one off you know having an MVP caliber season no question about that I will say you know we kind of have to read between the lines on these updates because for whatever reason the Sixers do seem to be very secretive about this but you know whoosh did have a note at Cameron was one of his tweets or one of his stories about this that quote the door is not closed on embed returning for the regular season  that's not super encouraging you know to me I wouldn't be surprised if he plays before the end of the regular season but I think his his fantasy season to me is probably over  yeah I mean most likely it is I mean I I think it's safe as if you have the IR spot just to keep them on your IR but yeah I wish I wish you know the team was more transparent about this I guess I'll just see how  what the surgeon thinks all that stuff about you know the timetable but  yeah I mean we can't be surprised to be for the year so he may end up pretty droppable if you have a I guess I would say a more Progressive League that ends before April maybe middle of March late March its most of like what are those liberal Progressive League's you'll probably have to drop it I think yeah I'm trying to I'm looking up as roster right now on Yahoo to see if that you know if there's a big purging over the weekend he's at 99% so you know most people probably just throw them in the IR spot for now I don't I'm not against doing that especially with the All-Star break coming up you know we'll get some more information in the next two to three weeks but yeah I mean he's so good that it's like even if you get a week like if he comes back for like the final week of your fantasy playoffs and you could you could make it that far it's gonna be you know we're not you I think even if he's under like a minutes limit or he's Rusty like he's still gonna put up crazy numbers so I'm not against it if you you know if you have the you know the IR spot or you're in with multiple IR spots like yeah I mean it's Joel and beat so I understand not wanting to drop him but yeah it's it's brutal man I mean he's gonna miss the most important part of the fantasy season Zack Levine as well the other big long-term injury news over the weekend Levine his season officially done he's gonna undergo surgery on his right foot there's saying that's gonna be a four to six months recovery time table so it to me no no necessarily like major change in expectations for the Bulls I still think they're one of those teams that is just going to push for the play in they've basically been the same team with or without Levine it's not like this is catastrophic for the the win and loss record necessarily but obviously somebody who we thought would perhaps be you know on the bidding block at the trade deadline this coming Thursday and now that's out of the question I guess the team could trade for him and view it as a future piece but once again we're kind of feels like we're going down the same path for the Bulls where it's like yeah I kind of like some of these players Colby White's playing well they're still stuck in the middle  there are absolutely Stuck in the Middle 23 and 27 right now I don't Levine Dickinson seem to really be impacting winning for them and from a fantasy perspective yeah I mean this is a lot more of what we've already seen like it's gonna be more I'll just soon move it's gonna be more Kobe white and maybe Pat Williams get some more touches Caruso so he can never stay healthy either but I think  like you were looting too we've already seen a lot of what this what this looks like when Lavigne is out because he's missed so much of the season anyway yeah I think you know biggest boost long term is Kobe white long term meaning rest of season he'd been able to pretty much maintained what he was doing not quite to that same level with Levine back but you know now that's you know Levine coming back is completely out of the question so I think you kind of view him as as that number two maybe even code number one was some of the numbers he's been putting up alongside to Martin Rosen I think the Rosen is somebody who could be moved at the deadlines especially now with Levine off the table you know it's like the team start to to think a little bit more seriously about tomorrow to Rosen you know who's Savage I just I don't really know what the interest level will be we've talked about him quite a bit on this pod but you know Chicago there right where they should be knife place in the Eastern Conference I would say that  if Chicago does choose to go in this direction which is you know pushing for a plane spot and just trying to get a couple of games worth the playoff Revenue I don't know that they could really fall Beyond 10 you know it's like at Atlanta has closed that Gap over the last couple of weeks they've started to play a little bit better but after that you got Brooklyn At You Know eight games under 500 Toronto is you know sinking ship their 15 games under and then you're down to you know the real Drake's of the NBA Charlotte Washington Detroit so I do think you know if you're Chicago if you're a bulls fan you're probably sick of just you know being in the the lower middle portion of the standings every year but if they do choose to push for that plan spot I think they should be able to get it  I think it'll be close I mean I think some of it does depend on what Atlanta and Brooklyn do at the deadline because Atlanta get out they again we've all heard the trade rumors about the Shantae Murray and if you trade him the team's already not good without him so you might have to just you move off a cappella and you just kind of hit the restart button potentially and then that's just been kind of Battle season won't be surprised basically I will be surprised if they trained I think anybody on that roster like I it seems like they'd probably prefer to keep Bridges but I think they would they would move him I think they would entertain offers for him so I guess yeah technically the Bulls could make the plan  that Carmody says if the Bulls trade voucher way Drummond would be worth adding  absolutely I mean I'm holding him in a couple of deep leaks right now those are you know 16 teams so it's a little bit different he's 27% roster right now in Yahoo leagues you know those tend to be 10 12 teams for the most part yeah if we're talking you know guys to stash ahead of the deadline no problem picking up Andre Drummond I mean it's a three-game week for Chicago we'll talk about the schedule a little bit but this is not a not an overly fantasy friendly week here with the All-Star break approaching so like a three game week this week is actually pretty solid yeah and a couple weeks where I'm dealing with some some tough starts to shins that will talk about but you know only about a third of the NBA has four games this week and Denver Minnesota Portland Utah all have two so yeah I wouldn't really be scared Away by a three game week this week specifically but yeah Drummond is absolutely on that list and you know even if they don't trade Foods I mean it drama could just get to like 15 minutes a night you know he's gonna give you eight points a steal a block you know somewhere  between seven and 12 rebounds if not more and you know there's always the possibility of things really go south for Chicago do they shut down booch you know he's already been injured earlier this season so this year to me Alex it is a little bit difficult to come up with like a long list of all these guys that I want to stash but Drummond is absolutely on it Miley concern would be is it easier for the Bulls to trade drum in the vujevich  like much yeah much on his guaranteed 60 million for this year next year in the year after Germans on a 3.3 million dollar player option so my word would be that they actually trade Drummond into basically an equal situation you know everybody not everybody but people have mentioned like I think like okay see might need a backup big I don't know like I don't think people are thinking of Andre Drummond but he basically be free he would basically be free what's up what's the downside of getting him on your team so part of me would worry that Drummond himself gets traded  but I think he would actually play more or around the same if you got traded somewhere so I don't think he's a bad pickup regardless I think there are a ton of teams in the Western Conference who would like to have Andre Drummond on their roster one you'd be an upgrade over a lot of the the backup centers who are floating around you think about a team like Phoenix who maybe just want some use of nurkic insurance but I think you also have to consider some of these teams that if you're if you consider yourself a contender in the west you know let's say you're a top 16 right now like think of the teams that you're going through right it's like you need somebody just a body I'm not saying that you know Andre Drummond is a yogic stopper but you need a body like that you need somebody to go burn some fouls burn some possession you know to guard you if you're playing Minnesota you got two big men and that's starting lineup you know the Clippers have zubac and tights you know the the Kings obviously have some bonus if you if you match up with the Lakers you know that's one of the bigger teams in the NBA you need somebody to throw it Anthony Davis and again I do not want this to be like clipped and go on Twitter and me saying like Andre Drummond get him he's gonna shut down those guys but he's huge he's a massive person and they're really aren't that many of those guys with the experience that drum and has floating around  good point here by Dylan L he says I would assume is actually the clear winner right now in Chicago with Levine going down for the season and could easily be an end of the bench League winner for a lot of rosters provides great stocks as well yeah I've been a notable to soon moose skeptic throughout most of my throughout the past couple years I think just because there have been a lot of times where it's like I think it's we all wanted to happen more than he's actually shown it can happen but this recent stretch by him has been very good he started the past four games even if you extend it to his past 10 16 points 3 rebounds three assists and basically two stocks the 58% from the field and 46% from three that's going to come down a little bit but then you're probably still talking about someone who's averaging like 133 and 3 with good stocks which stocks have been again something a part of his game that has mattered it's really only upside from here on out so definitely definitely an ad in 12 Team league  yeah no question I mean I think this is the best 10 game stretch that he's had really since he burst onto the scene as a rookie his roster rate shot up over the weekend up to 41% over on Yahoo and yeah you're totally right I mean I think it it pushes Kobe white ceiling higher the rest of the year but if you're talking about somebody who goes from not really roster Bowl in 12 or 14 Team league to somebody that you kind of have to have and maybe you're not starting from every single week but you're putting them out there on a four-game week absolutely and you know really the the defensive stats which Dylan points out I think are what your what you're really after here I mean the three point shooting the shooting in general is going to Wax and Wane means that like almost 60% from the field during the last 10 games like that's obviously not going to be sustainable but you know two combined steals a blocks per game you know he's got you know a couple multi Steel Games a couple multi-block games very good shot blocker for his position so yeah very good call there yeah I wanted to talk about Ono Alex as a deadline stash and I know in most deeply he's already rostered but we may have missed our window we should have done this pod yesterday because now we know click capella is going to miss seven to 10 days heading into the All-Star break and yeah if you're in a competitive league and the echo combo was not roster that probably  changed when ravers ran last night yeah I think so  Capella's injury not to mention the impending trade deadline I think made it the perfect time to pick up a Kong Woo which is something you know basically we've been saying for almost since a cone we've gotten to the MBA but you just you just have to do it you're like we're basically trapped we've been entrapped by yaka in potential to roster and in these types of situations yeah what makes it difficult is Cabela had been playing really well you know like I've been keeping for a Kong woo to take over that job for like three years now but Capella's putting up numbers man I mean if we're just talking strictly fantasy like before this injury you know he's basically averaging like 13 and 12 with a block per game you know not reaching the same Heights that he was at his absolute Peak but he'd stayed relatively healthy I think he only missed two games prior to this injury but he has somebody with a track record I mean he tends to miss 15 to 20 games per year so this should be surprising and you know good timing I suppose with the All-Star break should be back after that but at the very least you know you're getting a nice two weeks here out of a and yeah I think looking beyond the trade deadline you know for one capella could be moved we just talked about all these teams you know that need Big Ben I don't think it's out of the question that a Kung Fu could be traded on Thursday but at Atlanta you know their team that played a little bit better lately they could very easily you know fall out of this play and mix especially you know depending on what they do at the deadline and I think we're finally reaching the point where maybe we could see a you know a couple late season come on you know in the final month or so obviously the permit numbers have always been great you know they signed him to an extension last year for a reason so even if capella remains on this roster after the deadline I still don't really have a problem holding a Kung woo in anything but shallower leaks know because yeah if they continue to be bad then he is probably not going to play as many nuggets they'll just focus on Kong moose minutes and Capella's had some lower body stuff in the past anyway so you know he could he could get hurt for sure  all right I want to talk to Bucks real quickly because this is near and dear to our heart before we get into listener questions what the hell happened man what happened last night I watched that full game bucks a Roland you know even that Utah got off to a hot start you're kind of thinking here we go again but bucks put up a great second quarter they're up double digits in the third 40 to 13 they're outscored in the fourth quarter we got another just disastrous gave me a Lillard game It Feels Like These are happening more frequently I ran the numbers last night on basketball reference just kind of taking out taking a look at some different permutations you know it's like number of games where he shot under 30% from the field he already has more this season than he's had in any of the previous six seasons you have to go all the way back to like 2017 where he said I think he's at 8:00 or 9 games now after last night where he shot under 30% from the field you get similar results if you look at you know number of games with fewer than three made three pointers number of games where he shooting under 25% from three so to me the numbers back up the eye test right and then people will say well you know a couple nights ago he's five for five great game against Dallas like yeah he's still mixing in very good  games but the consistency has just not been there and if you take all the way back to January 1st which is 17 games Lillard is shooting 29.4% from three so this is more than just a short term stop I mean we're talking over a month he ranks 197 out of 222 players who've taken at least 33 in that span again since January 1st he's 40th out of 42 players you've taken at least a hundred in that span yeah Lillard  I think right now I mean last night he was dealing with an ankle injury before the game I think that may have been some of it Utah's also good at home but that's not really what we're talking about you know Middleton wasn't available last night  that meant Jae Crowder  uh Jae Crowder has been a whatever the plus minus the opposite of a plus minus God is just God he's a minus 20 per 100 for the Bucs this year I just he has been completely useless he's slow he's big he's slow he's old he's just can't do much anymore and it's the thing it's the Bucks starters that got killed like everybody in the Box starring lineup was basically -20 except yonis you know like we great packaging was a plus 11 but it's like that's that continues to be the box issue is like when  you know when when basically the bucks for best players are not on the court was mentioned Lopez also wasn't a available neither was Middleton  right yeah Lopez Middleton Road but that but that but this is all so the box issue is that  when when those four guys youngest Lillard Middleton and Lopez are not on the court it almost all four together they get destroyed they just they're horrible so for the bucks I think yeah they need to they need to figure out a function when like  only two of those guys are on the court at the same time  yeah the point of attack defense I think is is what really stands out when you watch these games and I don't think it's a lack of effort you know maybe sometimes on games part but they the communication to be did improve right away like watching the first couple doc games they look more locked in defense they look let's confuse there's there's a lot fewer possessions where Brooke Lopez is taking the ball out of bounds it's slamming it down because somebody missed a defensive assignment but they're just that they're letting guys get by them they're giving up so many easy looks they gave up a bunch of offensive boards last night you got 12 offensive rebounds for the game there was a report earlier today I think Mark Steyn had it that you know the Bucks and the maps have discussed a framework of a Bobby Portis Grant Williams trade  I don't love that you know I think it is in some ways tough to quantify exactly how much Port is means to the Bucks and I know you could argue that Grant Williams you know for certain matchups makes more sense I'm defense I don't know that that's the team needs I don't know if getting rid of Bobby Portis it might not be the greatest offender but he's at least get to bring it every single night the fact that she would be batted around worries me yeah I mean it worries me too it's actually since the Box don't really even have a backup center they use Bobby Porter says backup center if you were to trade him then what Robin Lopez I you know when we talked did say last night I should have played Robin Lopez more also concerning  yeah um he probably forgot Lopez Robin Lopez was actually on the team but I I think yeah but you sent me that that Porter's report I mean my first thought was you know I was thinking back to when he called out the team and Adrian Griffin around the playing tournament and I just wonder if Port is just kind of had it not just with like Adrian Griffin who was gone but just with the roster as a whole um which obviously concerning because I do think well he brings for for Milwaukee in terms of energy is fantastic  yeah and again tough to quantify you know there's some numbers that would probably indicate that you know moving on from Fortis would improve the Bucks defensively but I think he'd be losing more in terms of what he means to that team then that people would realize what other observation last night and you know props to my friend Preston Schmidt it was a you know a long time bucks fan well both before I even was locked in the Bucks text me last night about how many assistants they have on this bench I don't know if you notice that after he pointed it out I couldn't stop looking at it they go like 12 deep with assistant coaches deepest roster of assisted coach that I've ever seen uh yeah I've actually looking right now on the like the highlights from the game on ESPN and I do see the two rows of coaches  that is absurd I actually can't remember the last time I seen something like that yeah well I think doc brought in a couple of his own like they brought in Dave Yeager you know they had brought in that like some sort of like defensive guy from from Europe a few weeks before they fired Griffin and I think doc retain basically everybody and then brought in a few more I'm gonna have to get a full update on how many exactly there were but there were they were going three rows deep of guys with matching cups last night all right let's hit some listener questions here we'll continue to talk about players that were stashing around the deadline and so rumors that have popped up Matt says what's up everyone what's up Matt  how long before every team has these led courts  good question that was kind of going around Twitter earlier today I think it was out at the was it like the new Clippers Arena they were they were demoing something like that  I you know  I'm open to it I don't I don't think we're super far away from something like this you know I think anybody who's been to an NBA game and like the last five years is probably seen how they do this like in pregame right well they'll have these like crazy Graphics where the court looks like it's falling in on itself and then you can project whatever you want and it's it's pretty impressive I assume the technology is only gotten better and if you look at the teaser video that the MBA put out I mean it looks cool  I don't think we're that far away from it right I think the question is would it be something that's viewable in the arena or would this be tied into you know kind of like the metaverse viewing that the MBA is very much in on you know with the the Apple Vision Pro and all stuff like that I think it'd be very distracting if you're playing on the court but I certainly wouldn't rule it out for a like TV VR viewer experience  yeah I think they'll they'll take you to try it out obviously the mba's way more into experimenting with like quartz and stuff than they used to be  yeah I won't be surprised if it turns into a thing as a long as the players think it feels fine or they don't think it's too distracting or anything assuming it is something you see actually in the arena because I remember you know I think about like when they changed the ball in like 2013 or they tried to with all the players like revolted oh yeah I remember that I think that was like right around the Olympics for some reason I might even earlier like I remember Jason Kidd specifically it was like I'm not playing with this ball but they will be demoing this you know in practice overall start weekend they're gonna use it you know for like the celebrity game for all the stuff on Saturday night three point Dunk Contest skills so what we'll get a look at it and I mean my understanding is that it will be viewable in the arena in addition to to television and yeah I think this will be better for the TV product more than anything which is you know probably a slightly bigger concern for the NBA but I'm very open to it I'm very very open to it again as long as it's not distracting one to the players and two you know you don't have so much stuff going on where you're like all right I don't even feel like I'm watching an MBA game like I don't I don't know that I'd want to be watching game 7 of the NBA Finals with an LED cord  no I just yeah I don't want it to be distracting for anybody for me as if you were for the players for anybody and there's art because there's already enough distraction going on in the end I get distracted if a Court's colors are too if the Court's colors are weird like normal painted on so yeah that's that's kind of my thoughts we've come a long way we've come a long way in the last 10 years I don't think the MBA would have been nearly as open to this I remember the Bucks had like a black type of court that they wanted to do back in like 2015 that the NBA was like no it's just not gonna work it's not gonna work it's too distracting and now here we are with like bright purple and lime green chords all over the MBA all right good stash question here from Paul he says who would you rather stash scoot Kennard can you update George shaedon Sharpe at the Anthony Melton Jacob Gilyard either of the Thompsons and how would you rank them in order of value so we got a handful players to try to rank here out  it might be easier to rank these in terms of like generally how I feel about it's going to be hard for me to rank this money players in order but here's what I would say like  I think Melton is probably the safest because we already know he has a safe role that he plays really well in the problem is he's been hurt for a while so that's a concern but hopefully he's better after the All-Star break  Scoot and shake and sharp yeah I'm pretty in on those guys a stashes because I again the portal and Portland so bad they all have a history of of tanking late in the season and and pulling their veterans and frogs and probably be gone and stuff like that it will still be tough for them because Simon's is still gonna be there but we'll see what they do with Jeremy Grant I'm worried about canard's health but I think he is a good player to roster Chianti's interesting for sure especially if the Jazz get rid of some veterans again Gilyard Kennard any of these Grizzlies guys I have such a little confidence that they can stay healthy or that the Grizzlies provide like accurate injury reports yeah and I don't mind amount of us are stashes but a lot of those guys I mentioned besides like shag and sharp scoot  and melted are in like one massive tear together I guess I would put those three I mentioned at the top and then everybody else and they're kind of their own tier  okay I don't need to go through and like re-litigate any of that because I was only accurate so I will default to your rankings on that we don't need to spend another five minutes on it but good question and thank you for sending that Paul Mr Ray any relationship to Dre we have no idea but Mr Ray says who to drop to pick up Paul Reed if you wants to grab Paul Reed should he drop Josh Hart or Malcolm Brockton  man um  that's a tough question because of the situation you know that in face is probably being a headline of potential trade  even if he stays in Portland he could get shot down he's never gonna be healthy player anyway at the same time hearts hearts value is completely capped to whenever Julius Randle comes back right so we know and I think and Adobe just some degree right like you look at the last week and you're like oh man he's playing 41 minutes per game like yeah that feeling lower is a bit went in and nobody's in there yeah I yeah Julius Randle we know the long-term extent of his injury and an Obi were a little bit less clear yeah um  both guys would get picked up if you drop them tell you that right now  um I guess I guess maybe the bigger question is do you have to drop heart or Brockton for Paul Reed  yes well so the Brogden thing like you said there's been a lot of dicks Whispers I think that would make a lot of sense for a number of reasons like at the ends up there  you know what is the ultimate role at that point you know is he coming off the bench do they try to slide him into the starting lineup is you know there's probably a little bit lower upside than we're seeing in Portland but you know even if you take like 80 85% of what he's giving you this year it's still pretty productive player I was waiting for you to bring up the do we actually need to add Paul Reed I you know I bid on him and a bunch of League's this weekend I was careful not to go overboard because you know he started for the last five games he's played serious minutes really and only like one and a half of those you know there's that game like everybody was out in Denver and he played 42 minutes but 24 minutes against Portland play 28 minutes against Utah was not foul trouble and either of those games and then started to played 15 minutes against Brooklyn on Saturday so you know I don't I he's like the clear all right he's gonna see more minutes he'll be in the starting lineup whatever without a bead but it's not necessarily A all right now you're feeling every single minute that Joel embiid played situation and the Sixers have had so many other guys in and out that it's been tough to gauge what that rotation will like like they basically have like at least two or three rotation players out including Melton you know Maxie to buy his Harris those guys have time lately so it has been really difficult to assess I still think like I want Paul Reed but if I have to drop part or Brogden yeah I don't know that becomes a tougher decision like I I assume you're in a relatively shallow League like those are two worst players you're doing okay  says he responded with a follow-up Mr a says my centers our heart and shine and Evan Mobley he needs a third Center  okay so yeah if you need read I I'm just gonna I'm just gonna pull the Band-Aid off and say he dropped Brogden because I'm worried about him getting traded or getting hurt or getting shut down like there are three factors kind of revolving around him where there's really only one sort of negative factor around heart and  yeah  okay Ricardo says speaking of Reed he said I dropped Reed and Josh Hart to activate Kyrie and D Anthony Melton yeah gotta activate Kyrie I don't think there's this any question there you know Melton yeah I don't know exactly what you're saying here but he's not playing tonight we don't we have really no idea when he's going to be back you know pretty low on games before we get to the all-star break they play Wednesday they play Friday they play Saturday so they are one of just a handful of teams that has four games this week and then most teams only play you know two games next week so that's kind of negligible but you know you don't you don't have to activate Melton right now right I guess unless you're really confident that he's coming back later this week and you already know he's not playing one game so you know if you already made this move  we'll see hopefully Milton plays later in the week but you know I would say you for now you could probably hold on to one of of reader heart right  yeah yeah melted yeah you're gonna want melted over over I think read or heart I think it's just safer you know Matt points out the chat that read Paul Reed was sick last game or a played 15 minutes put up two points for rebounds nothing else that is true but his biggest has a starter have been really up and down in general yeah 25 minutes per game in 12 starts some of those are 17 some of those are 40 so it is hard to say but definitely worth mentioning he was sick last game which is why I played a specialty bad all right Matt says he's in a high-scoring Yahoo points league with points for all counting stats should he drop Harrison Barnes Jalen Suggs or Grayson Allen  uh my gut reaction is to tell you to drop Harrison Barnes  but he look he's still he's still on his streak of a double-digit shot attempts you know he after his bad 9 point performance he went for 22 and I went for 11 I just think ultimately saw um Barnes has a very little history of like  especially lately being consistently good player for Fantasy songs all so pretty up and down but I don't trust folks to stay healthy and Grayson Allen is almost too good to drop I get that like  he's not  Elegance a better points or she's me a better category League player the points League  but  they the sons have been pretty their comfortable playing in 30 minutes every single game regardless of who's available like if the whole team is healthy Grayson Allen still getting 30 minutes so that that's very helpful yeah I know Grayson Allen is not played super well lately it's got a battle through that ankle injury you know yeah it had one game where he was forced out missed the next game and maybe he's been hopped a little bit I would still drop Harrison Barnes here especially if you're if you're if you're saying you get like you know legitimate points for for every category even when Harrison Barnes had that you know improbable three or four game run it was basically just scoring you know you'll mix in four or five rebounds but he doesn't he doesn't really give you assist he doesn't really do anything on defense so if I'm choose between those three I would drop Barnes  all right Scarlett says sitting at rank one right now in a nightcat league 16 Timur nice work what do you do if your players are all a must roster thinking streaming is important come playoffs you're not wrong about that you know he kind of depends who were talking about at the end of the roster but it's a pretty good problem to have right I mean if you're sitting first in your league there's a reason for that you you know it's not necessarily streaming but I think you just play the matchups you play the number of games down the stretch and you kind of stream within your own roster I wouldn't I wouldn't go out of your way to drop someone now because you're you're worried about what happened a month from now like it's statistically speaking chances are you know one of these guys might get hurt and make that decision for you  yeah exactly like Nick said what do you do I think you you start gloating and the league chat maybe just be like who's or what you guys gonna do something about me winning dominating this league all the time but no you know you don't want to drop anybody early you could always make a consolidation trade if you really feel like streaming is that important like trade to your guys for for one better guy if you really feel like you want to or feel like you have to stream to win but other than that I think you just kind of wait to see what the trade deadline brings and potential injuries  all right talked about to Sumo good note there from Dillon all right  great little John says he's got a crazy trade question  Paul George miles Bridges and a bead for Anthony Edwards I think that's J dub Jay Jay Williams and Jordan Poole in a point Sleek so George Bridges and bead for Edwards William's and pool I wearing that this was you know just proposed so the bead part of this to me is kind of a wash so it's basically Paul George and Miles bridges for Edwards Williams and pool as we've been saying at the beginning of the year at this point in being in pool is a wash  pool probably doesn't pool doesn't have to be rostered like there's no reason to feel like you have to roster pool so I don't even really view them as a part of this trade I mean he's he's fine he had a stretch where he played well but like he's okay he's really only like a fringe points leak player  and then be done for the year fantasy season  you might be done for the fancy season so really yeah this is Paul George and Miles bridges for Anthony Edwards and Jay dubb  which is fair ish unless you think Miles Bridges is gonna get traded to like a potential Contender and he's gonna play 24 minutes a game and started like 34 minutes again  so I think I would rather be on the Edwards JW side of this trade  I think so too I think so too and look at me if you're getting pulled the throwing whatever so at the end of your bench if there's if he gets hot you can throw them out there you could drop them you can stream that spot but yeah I guess  you know part of this we kind of have to discuss the MP part is like you know would there be any part of you where you're like man what if he does come back sooner and I really regret you know not having him for the final two weeks of the fantasy season or is that is that just something you can't really consider I don't I don't think you have to  okay so like yes maybe he does come back for the end of the regular season but what are the odds he's playing  25 even 25 minutes a game for the family for the part of the fantasy playoffs that matter like you might be playing like 18 19 minutes a game  leading up to the actual MBA playoffs so that would even if you get them back say I'll back to backs maintenance like it's just it's really unclear  Jerome says do you think Josh giddey gets traded this week  Stephanie possible what would you say percentage chances that Josh Getty is on another team come Thursday night  um  I don't know I mean I think I think they would  for just completely on court reasons I think trading giddy makes sense I don't think they need him and SGA and Jalen Williams you know so  but I don't know what team wants him necessarily I might put it at just because I have no idea I'm gonna put it like 20% because I don't feel like I've  I've heard anything that makes a ton of sense but okay see you know it in terms of like management they're pretty tight lip like rumors don't really come out okay see like they do other teams yeah I mean is it a third year so you got you know kind of at least one more year on the rookie deal so I think there is some appeal there although if you're trading Forum you're probably looking at it as you know you hope it works out and you sign him to an extension I do think it makes some sense right I mean Oklahoma City definitely does not need to make a move they're sitting on top at the top of the western conference right now so I don't know that there's a ton of pressure to do that and you know it I think it would be more likely maybe that you're attaching pigs and you try to get a bigger fish in there but as we mentioned there's just you know not that many names that make a ton of sense that I think okay see it's also trying to be really careful about not messing up what they have right it's like going out getting you know something like top 25 players like does that does that throw off you know the the development of guys like Jalen Williams who was you know kind of like a borderline All-Star start to the season obviously sga's been fantastic I think we're it makes sense is you're either adding shooting because that's that's not what Josh Getty does or you're adding a big man right I don't think you're swapping him out for another guard or swapping him out for another Wing like  they need spot of shooting and I think more than anything they need interior defense they need another option Beyond General Hardware so putting on the table I think it's appealing I think he has a lot of value I think it's value certainly lower now that was coming into the year but again yeah who's the player out there you know it's like you flip them for like a PJ Washington that I don't know yeah because you're only really talking about teams that are already bad or who would be wanting to pull the plug you know you'd be like you'd be looking basically like everybody in the East that's I guess technically Atlanta and Below but more like Brooklyn and below I think of the west it's more like Utah and Below probably not including Houston or really Golden State but yeah it's like I got a do you do you send them to Brooklyn and to try to get McKell Bridges or something along with a bunch of other pics you know that kind of a thing but it's hard for me to say like do I expect them to get traded I don't  do that I actually love that idea that you know more salary we'd have to go and whatnot but I bridges in OKC like that that is the type of star player I would add you know I don't I don't know that this is a team that needs like I don't like Donovan Mitchell or a player like that you're like all right you're the number one guy now or your number one it's like somebody who's a star but it's also kind of a role player at the same time I mean there's a reason that whiskey every team but like to have McCall Bridges so you're you're saying like if you're a contending team you're not really that interested in giddy  no no he's too he's too young and he has no history like he has no real I don't think he has a bunch of a history of honestly making OKC better or in any way like he's intriguing because he's a great passer but at the same time I think he has a lot of holes in his game that it's just these guys were great they have great size and they can pass there's so many more of these guys  in terms of like an influx into the MBA because taller players are more skilled now but he can't defend and he can't shoot threes  so  it's just it the spot for him  it's like what's the who wants a guy like that if you're if you're good if you if you have a floor space in five I guess  but  I don't know I just  I don't I don't know if exact impactful but like we it's a different issue but it's you talk about Ben Simmons in that way and you talk about like the Thompson Twins who I love much better prospects than getting their bugger Defenders then giddy but they can't shoot the horses and Getty and he's like if you can't do what if you can't shoot or you can't play defense it really I think limits your value to a contender  I don't know what contending team you know doesn't want to add bad shooting and bad defense too that exactly um you know the two teams I would point to and I wouldn't consider either of them a contender but they're they're at least above the Atlanta Mendoza Line would be like Indian Orlando you know it's like you can see Orlando taking a shot on a guy like that you know they kind of already have a kind of a playmaking wing and Carol obviously and then you know Franz Wagner I think they feel pretty good about the roster but that's type of player you know Young on a rookie deal that you can see or Lando bringing in its like you know is there is there something to be around you know Wendell Carter trade I think that would make a ton of sense for Oklahoma City you know that's something I could see coming together and then Indiana it's like could you do like a buddy hield Josh giddey swap um you know again I have to you know dig a Little Deeper on that to see how that would add up contract wise but yeah I think those are teams that are hoping to win a playoff series probably not hoping to win the NBA title where you could kind of justify the you know get the talent in the door and we'll try to develop it over the next couple of years strategy  I think it makes more sense for Indy because they have Myles Turner at the five and yeah I think it I think that's more of a move I think getting healed back would be nice you know for for okay see my concern with Orlando is they already can't shoot but to save their lives so and I don't know how much you want to take the ball out of the hands of like uh Wagner and and and Ben Carroll but that's but then I don't want to make the argument that like they shouldn't have a point guard  because I I think it's helpful so I yeah both intriguing at least yeah Utah's another team that that intrigues me kind of in that middle Zone as well out in the west all right good question here for Mr a  two similar players assume this is kind of a who would you rather roster going forward just to move or J Navy  I saw that question I looked up early kind of in anticipation because that is a very good question I think I would rather take ivy  it depends if you if you're like desperate if you're in a category league and you're desperate for blocks and steals I'm okay with adding the sooner over Ivy but at this point it seems like IVs got in the trust of money Willie Williams and his meds have been pretty steady and like the high 20s low 30s with Cade Cunningham back at East producing well I think I think I've used the safer bet long term yeah again similar players they rank in the same Zone over the last month I think you said it right like there's a lot more defensive potential with the Sumo like if you look at some of like the eighth cat nine cat rank so probably rank a little bit higher because of the scarcity of those stats so again yeah if you need blocks and seals if that's where you're worried about I would I would say definitely just move because I've even really doesn't give you a whole lot of that he'll have a flash games every now and then it feels like he either gives you like two steals or two blocks or absolutely nothing so you're gonna get a lot more consistent defensive production out of assumed but I think you're right if you're just kind of looking for  traditional points rebounds assists you know you know kind of higher Ministry and I can tonight it's probably Ivy but again with LaVine out of the lineup here as long as Chicago doesn't do something drastic and you know bring in  a young you know guard or two I do think the super could actually end up playing more minutes or at least comparable minutes the rest of the way  I do  I just I I think the sun moves history of real like meaningfully in a big way scaling up his usage isn't that great and he's doing it recently to an extent like he's a CIS Productions battery is taking a 10 shots a game basically but yeah I would I think I would just rather have IV in general  all right Dylan says is it officially time for everyone to give Aaron Nesmith some more love he's quietly putting up top 70 numbers since the Bruce Brown trade he's been a top 40 player over the last two weeks almost two stocks two plus made threes 15 points six rebounds in that span  I think I think so I'm on board with with giving Aaron Neeson respect let's say you do you respect him I am putting respect on his name I'm giving him his flowers no need if you listen to the Friday podcast it's it's a very Pro niece Smith podcast I think we've mentioned him as a waiver wire pickup probably like four times this year at various points throughout the year and I think we actually recommended back to back shows this Friday and last Friday so yeah I mean he's he's playing really well he's figured his shot out which is been huge for him get that one Bad season and Boston that I think made everybody in Boston turn on him and since then he has been very good but he yeah these these this past two weeks or so he's at 46% for three for the year 46 percent and that is that is the year and East but that was promised right I mean when he was when he was at Vanderbilt I mean that was the selling point it's like this guy you know he's not just like a you know 38 39% shooter it's like he could be the best spot of shooter in the NBA like that's that's the cell here on the Smith and he was fine as a rookie he was fine you know even at times last year in Indy but we're now seeing you know the full line you know kind of Duncan Robinson type of maturation I guess for your knee Smith and we'll see if that you know able to go year to year right not often that you see somebody have this crazy of the Season you know where you shoot 45 plus percent from three and then he could do it again the next year by guess is he probably regrets is a little bit but if you're regressing from 46% to 42 or 43% you know that's that's still Ultra Elite and you know what they think is I'd like to see a little more volume you know like if you're shooting 46% you got to be doing everything you can to be taking eight or nine a game and set of like four or five a game but yeah in general  all in on respecting are nice Smith and here's a good one for from Drew as a follow-up niece Smith or December and in ESPN League  um I think niece Smith is probably the better a category League player  uh Desu mu might be the better points it's it's closed honestly do you have a strong preference on either of these guys  right now would be Nesmith you know he not only is he giving you a ton of Threes but you know he's especially lately last couple weeks you know he's been close to two blocks of steals per game so I don't think there's like a drop off there necessarily compared to just Sumo there's a more reliable rebounder he's actually been a pretty decent passer the thing I worry about with Indy more so than Chicago is just kind of the whims of this rotation you know like there's it's really tough when you go through and try to project minutes you know night tonight for that team because they they have guys who have kind of mixed in here and there and you know early in the year was coming off the bench there was some nice where he was playing like 18 minutes of game his minutes have been pretty steady so I'm not super worried about it but there is a big difference between you know playing 34 minutes a night which is what he's doing over the last two weeks and you know playing 26 minutes a night which is what he was doing over the previous month so you know if you think he's playing 32 plus minutes tonight I would lean Smith but yeah it's a good question I assume it will probably be better if like if the Rosen got traded or the Bulls shot guys down like the Sumo is just going to be better but yeah we have no idea so I think I think I think the Sumo is the floor is the sorry is the ceiling play like if you are I don't know sixth or fifth in your league and you just need like it's all upside place I think I would actually rather have to assume but if it's just all things equal probably need Smith  yeah I got a good way to phrase it all right Dylan says Nyan Cat League  let's talk Wizards all right the viewership is about to Skyrocket feels like they're trading kuzma tius for and a lot right that would be quite the change I think at least a couple of those guys probably get dealt who are we liking best for Silly Season Pittsburgh cooler Bali or even this over you or Omar rui Omari I think it's almost really I I pride myself Alex on knowing at least like a little bit about every player in the league  there's been a couple times in the last few weeks where you know I've had to be like all right let's go on here Washington's been one of those teams and more recently the Memphis Grizzlies when I saw Trey Jameson and the starting lineup that was one right to go over to basketball reference hand up here and for Memphis is it is it toss on a woman that was that was a tough one yeah yeah but Omar rui look I think you're right to bring up the Wizards 100% because they are they're horrible and they have veterans on the team that could get moved  Kula Bali  I think you know he had a pretty good outing the other day I think it was when pool got scared of Kawhi Leonard and seriously had an illness but then he followed that I'll put like five points and then 0 points  so I still think of all those guys  Kula Bali probably has the highest upside because he is a good Defender  and I think they would like to let just see what they have in him like Kenny handle the ball at all can he do more he just hasn't proven it really I'm a personally like I'm a big Corey Pittsburgh guy which I know sounds probably weird and kind of obscure I think he can if they start giving him 35 minutes I think he can play awesome to be honest with you but  I think there's a decent chance that they trade him because you would be perfect for like a contender so that's that's tough to say but I think it's fine to stash below I think it's fine oh yeah I mean  if we're talking about the Wizards trading you know three starters and you know one of their better more reliable veteran bench players in Delon Wright it's like anything's on the table at that point I mean you'd be looking at like two or three guys who are probably worth picking up because they just be pretty low on players but you also have to keep in mind if you think they're trading that many players you know it's not going to be all picks you're getting some guys back and a few of those guys will probably be young and we'll be in the starting lineup so I wouldn't get too excited about it I mean cool about me I'm intrigued by what he could be long term  you know he's made a handful of starts this year some of them have been good some have been horrendous you know even when he said you know a bunch of games where he's played 30 plus minutes again very very up and down but I'm intrigued and I'm with you I think his Birds the safest highest floor option like if he suddenly starts playing 38 minutes of game for a terrible wizard team I mean he could hit he could give you like four four and a half made threes a game like he's gonna shoot her but if you would in a way become like their number one option which is a scary thought but it is possible with the way the Wizards are going he's a guy I would want you know and a category League especially getting that that high volume three point production all right good question about the Knicks here for Pedro he said he wanted to add Paul Reed so we had to choose between dropping Josh Hart adopted even chenzo he said he chose Josh Hart I think that means he actually dropped even shenzo so he chose to keep Josh Hart thinking that his court times seemed safer when OG comes back in our opinion did he make the right call  yeah I think so because heart is more of like a foreword to replace Randall's minutes when OG comes back Stephen shenzo is more like a guard even though they're basically the same size the heart will rebound and stuff like that I think he made the right choice long I want to make this longer I think he made the right choice  yeah I mean I actually think there's no right or wrong choice here I think those guys are both really comparable they even have his Knights where you wish you would have kept him but I think on balance and for talking the next you know 35 games you'll probably get a little bit more you know consistency in floor which Josh Hart  that says do you prefer to hold your ads until after the deadline or do you treat it as a normal week very good question  yeah I don't play in a lot of like daily moves capped League's but I would I would hold my ads I think because I think I talked about this a lot like the there the the most impactful I would say probably three waiver periods are of the entire year are the one before the first game starts the one the week after the first the after the first week of the season and then the week of the trade deadline so I would I would say all of your ammo and just wait until the trade deadline hits and then just you got just go crazy with your moves then I would just hold them  Alec asks is Bruce Brown a trade deadline hold because considering dropping him and folds when my injury injury players get back I said he's also holding Malik monk Azar Thompson and Dennis Smith Jr I mean I've heard a lot of Rumblings that Bruce Brown could be on the moving again I you know obviously would depend where he would land I think you know plenty of contending or pseudo contending teams would be interested you know as an exactly take it off and Toronto you know started a handful of games She's Come Off the Bench for about half I had a nice run you know he's putting up a bunch of blocks and steals but you know really inconsistent so you know it  I mean I guess I would hold him and just hope that he lands in a better situation I guess I just I never been that enamored with Bruce Brown I think he was in a perfect role in Denver and I think we're kind of chasing you know finding that that perfect fit again and you know there's just not to me there's not that much upside you know it's like what is a best case scenario Bruce Brown he's hovering around like the 90th best fantasy player yeah I mean exactly I just he's 27 he's not like a young guy so if he gets traded I assume it's too like a contender and then he's basically a sixth man and probably not worth rostering I think him and fultz are droppable I don't have any faith in full staying healthy I would I think it's good to hold monk I obviously very strong willpower by you to not drop monk during this recent stretch and he had to you know about Bounce Back Games its last two  and a star and dsj I roster dsj I wanted to happen we'll see what the I would hold him just because I don't know what the Nets are gonna do  and I'm sorry is  forever intriguing but it's just not just not happening  I don't know all right Zaza out says who are you all taking in a points League PJ Washington or Paul Reed another good question a lot of tough one says bringing it yeah this is a really tough point of the year and  I think I would take Reed but it's probably closer than I think most people would just be like just give Paul Reed but I think it is pretty close because even we talked about this early reads but it's a starter not that consistent he's technically a better fantasy points per minute guy 1.1 to PJ Washington zero point nine  okay if the minutes are going to be you know this this different that it's it's almost a wash I think I would just rather have read but it's closed yeah um  you know Mark Williams is we think coming back at some point that affects things I do that I watched it I think Washington could be moved and I don't think it would necessarily be a better situation right I mean he's been even though he hasn't been starting the majority of these games he's been playing on a bad team that still you know puts up a reasonable amount of points you know is involved in all these like weird shootout games where they end up losing by 20 and he's playing like almost 30 minutes a game over the last month I just if he's traded I don't see him being in that ideal the situation and the other thing is this is a points league in a big part of the reason that PJ Washington is valuable is these big man who shoots three and it's not as rare as it was a few years ago but he's hit in two threes a game and you're not quite as concerned about that and the points league so yeah I am very skeptical and you can tell me like anything happens with Paul Reed and the next two weeks either you know you could tell me averages 18.8 minutes per game despite starting or he ever just 30 minutes per game and is you know the season savior but I think that's where I would lean in a points League specific  all right Dremel 28 says which players are a mustache so far he just got into the chat yeah we will do a recap I guess if we've mentioned a combo if you still out there he is still available in like 30% at Yahoo leaks so double check we talked about Drummond we talked about scoot I guess I just assumed we could could be considered a stash you know might be yeah picked up in a bunch of leaks already you know Corey kispert you know a number of the Warriors or The Warriors the Wizards Kula Bali I think those are the main ones right I mean we if we really want to go deep I know somebody we've talked about is like Nick Smith in Charlotte  not somebody I would go right now you know that's a wait and see you know if they purged that roster maybe but yeah anybody else come to mind would you consider I don't understand yeah I was I was just about to say a star people people bring up a star in Amanda together actually don't know if a man's a big stash because I don't I think he said just really wants to win and they're going to continue playing a playing their normal rotation I don't really think they're gonna make any big moves he's a stash in the sense that if you really think he's contributing to winning he's gonna start seeing 25 minutes of game  he's been you know the past 12 games 19 minutes 256 fantasy points which is great I mean if you really want a roster as well team points league go ahead but I want to expect them to start talking seeing 30 minutes a game like a sar might if the Pistons really pulled a plug yeah he showed man I mean I don't know what we're doing I think you know to me that would be a bogdanovich trade right and then then it's like all right the minutes have to go to him they actually have to you there's no justification to keep you know Roland Kevin Knox out there the way they have say I would I would put them on my list you know somebody else I'll throw out there and  this is deeply ex only you know somebody who actually helped carry me to a title in a League last year when I was you know playing the matchups playing the schedule game had some injuries  Isaiah Joe Isaiah Joe oh it's a big game store the end of last year and this this ties into what we talked about with Josh giddey earlier if you're trading gitty which again I don't know if they will you said what 20% chance I think that it's probably closer to 20% that it is 50% for me but if they drink giddy yeah you're looking to get a veteran back and maybe it's a wash but if the goal is or get more shooting out there and if you can get Isaiah Joe to  24 25 minutes a night even though you're looking at like three main threes a game he's at 9 games this year where he's played at least 25 minutes and he's averaging three made threes on 48% so somebody who's been hurt lately minutes have been down prior to that again we're talking deeply is only but if you're if you're like hard up for for 3-pointers that's somebody I would consider deep category leaks  yeah I would say no point six yes category only  all right clawed Santos says you think Melo is coming back  I don't see Carmelo making a return to the NBA no lamelo  huh this this is absolutely killed my nfb Casey team dude I mean I really loved my team I love I still love my roster and I've got 22 games out of the guy who I took with like the 14th overall pick in that League  I don't know if he's coming back man I would say it's more likely than not that he does and he's missed what five games in a row I think tonight will be six  there's been no indication that this is like week to week although it's seems to be turning into that I don't really think Charlotte needs him to be out to be terrible I mean they are 10 and 30 what's going to be interesting though is you know like the battle for those those final four spots with the same Lottery odds  I I don't really see Charlotte falling out of that they have about a five game cushion on Portland right now so that would be kind of the only other team to monitor but again  it's not like they're ripping off win the battles in the in the lineup so I think he comes back at some point I would be surprised if we've seen them like fully the last of it but he might come back and then get her to get it's true yeah I would say I would believe he's coming back but would not be shocked if it was until after the All-Star break  oh that's well said yeah that's a good way to put it all right well and on this one from Nomad he says a sar or a man rest of season who do you want  I would say a song I trust that situation a little bit more but there may not be a correct answer here  yeah I would say a sar because they're the they're not the same player I think a man probably has higher upside  just like pure fantasy points per game point per minute whatever however you want to phrase it but I think that there is a better chance that a Tsar  sees 30 minutes a game for the last month and a half then I'm at yes that's exactly my line of thinking yeah I think over the last month I commenced probably been the better option but it's you know it's not like he's like a world on fire right I mean both of them are putting up great defensive numbers they both rebound extremely well for their size of position you know men's little bit better of a passer the shooting has been about what you'd expect you know the three point shooting is disastrous that I think is neither of them are taking that many so it's not killing them field goal percentage wise but I want to see what it men's role looks like I mean tar he could be back this week I think it's expected that he's back this week he's missed a month plus  that's yet another Wing that you're throwing into the mix here I worry about what that means for his minutes I think there's a better chance that you know I'm not really high on this Houston team but they're in the plans own and they are you know they've won way too many games where they could try to get down to the bottom four so I think they kind of have to go for it it's not like they have all these obvious sell-off players so I think it's more likely that over the meaningful you know final month of like the fantasy season or the fantasy playoffs that a man is playing like 14 minutes a game and Stars playing 28 so I'm with you on that  yeah I think yeah the point about Tara Easton's great because I heard a big name or anything people might roll their eyes with because they might be like well why would it's just to why won't you give me all I'm in Thomson medical retirees Eason tari Easton still leads the rockets and plus minus so he's gonna be out there if he's healthy all right man we'll wrap it up
