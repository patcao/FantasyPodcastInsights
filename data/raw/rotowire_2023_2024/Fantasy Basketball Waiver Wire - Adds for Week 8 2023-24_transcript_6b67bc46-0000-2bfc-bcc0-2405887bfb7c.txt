welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy it's Friday December 8th 2023 Alex barutha here with Shannon McEwan and Ken k train Crites all aboard  I will apologize to everybody in advance and recovering from being sick I'll try not to coffin everybody's ears who is listening to this podcast but that's why I sound like I have tissue paper stuck up my nose  last night the Lakers beat the Pelicans 133 to 89 in Las Vegas during the late in season Tournament game  Lakers took off in the second quarter they never looked back I mean he was basically a home game for the Lakers we can we can kind of talk about some of the Dynamics of this when we talk about the next game which I'm not looking forward to but New Orleans struggled 36% from the field  Trey Murphy who came off the bench was the team's highest score with 14 points LeBron went for 30 um very free charges Darius yeah efficient 30 took three charges Lakers shoot 55% it was it was just a route like they they just dominated I mean Ken did you have any takeaways from this game other than just like maybe he's a bad game for the Pelicans he goes Zion a reporter s Zion well he was gonna do with the 500,000 dollars if he wanted he just laughed so maybe they party to Target a little early in Las Vegas or the yeah  I love it Austin said after the game he he mentioned those three charges that LeBron said look when you're best players all in taking charges one of those charges was from the rotund Williamson  he's like we were so excited I mean you know and James is giving up his body at age 30  and it he hit like three threes in a row in that second quarter they were deep they were like logo three you know like oh my goodness nine of 12 from the field he hit all four of his threes you know what's great for the Lakers do is they basically got to take the second half off for the most Parts 80 and LeBron should have plenty in the tank for Saturday's game yeah Shannon we saw like I mentioned Trey Murphy was a team's highest score for the Pelicans he still coming off the bench though  any concerns about that or do you think like either still a good chance he ends up playing 30 minutes a game off the bench maybe the Pokemon starting lineup at some point you know her Jones is still in there right now  yeah I mean that that 43 to 17 third quarter by the Lakers basically makes last night's game you know absolutely and there's no reason to really there's no big takeaways from last night's game is Susan turned into a blowout you know nothing really matters what happened with the Pelicans from there so the 22 minutes that Murphy saw last night I'm not worried about like you said you still the leading scorer for 14 points in those 22 minutes and anytime you was on the floor he was very aggressive on the offensive end you know he's played 2230 and 22 minutes in the three games he's returned from injury having some rest kind of being East back into the rotation champ be a big surprise but the fact that he already hit 30 minutes basically alleviates any concerns I would have will he be in the starting lineup I think that's a bigger question mark I don't Herbert Herbert Jones been playing so well for the Pelicans that I think they're gonna stick with them for at least a little while I mean they're 12 and 11 they had some assess the in-season tournament but if maybe if the overall team play falls off they'll insert Murphy and they're starting lineup but right now I fully expect Murphy at least in the short term to continue to be deployed kind of as the scoring threat Off the Bench I have no concerns about him from a fantasy perspective I was very high on him before he suffered his injury during the during training camp and I expect him to be a monster especially for rotisserie leagues top 100 player great percentages three-pointers some defensive stats I love trade Murphy for Fantasy this year maybe he's getting 30 minutes of game you almost prefer he comes off the bench because if he's gonna be mixed in with backups he's going to be a higher priority higher usage rate when he's on the floor then trying to get the ball from McCullum or Zion or Ingram  absolutely you want to talk about the early game Ken yes I'm sorry Alex but the Indiana Pacers beat Alex's Milwaukee Bucks won Twenty Eight one 19 in Vegas  37.4 quarter really wanted for the Pacers Halliburton was fantastic again 27 points on 11 of 19 shooting 15 dimes seven rebounds interesting the Indiana bench outscored Milwaukee's bench 43 to 13 Halliburton hit a  a late fourth quarter three-pointer dagger really to win it for the Pacers and he flashed the game time watch pose that was delicious I enjoyed that  um  Alex though you added a note about Buck bucks veteran challenges coaches and teammates what was this all about  yeah Bobby Portis in the locker room this is I think from Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report Bobby Porter was in the locker room challenging Adrian Griffin challenging his teammates I think about effort Etc I see a long time coming to be honest I look this game first of all I just want to say Tyreese Halliburton is insane  he's so good I mean we all we all know this we play fans for a long time but my God I mean he goes for 26 and 13 a triple double against Boston the best defensive back court the league with zero turnovers then goes for another 0x with 27 and 15 and he has four games this year of 0 turnovers all of them at least 13 assists it's unreal but yeah he's ridiculous and yeah um  yeah the  the Box they went to a Zone um and it was horrible I mean I really don't know what they were doing out there it's like a Zone in the third quarter they're giving up wide open you know free-throw line jumpers to Bruce Brown in the middle of the lane there's dunker spot guys are hitting threes  it was just you know the Bucks like a decent quarter but a decent couple like the middle of the game for the Bucs was okay like second in the third quarter was fine but they got crushed in the fourth it was horrible  the Pacers make Boston and Milwaukee they look they look old they just keep up with that four quarter running gun pace  yeah I was it was awful let's see I don't know if there were any you know  all right looks like it now I don't  oh I'm  you froze for a second there  we go oh I think you're back I think I'm back sorry guys um I was saying former former Celtic Aaron Nesmith looked amazing I don't think he's that good for Fantasy but as a real life player he is a great hustle guy he has learned from the experience in Boston that when his shots on and he's got a hustle on defense and he just keeps hustling and hustling hustling and they loved him for it they keep throwing a minute power forward even though he's six six maybe you know  they do love the hustle minutes from niece Smith but you're right fantasy wise it doesn't help us as much but so much energy yeah with niece Smith I mean he had a spot start it wasn't even a spot start he took over the sparta starting power forward gig from top and for one game but then he but then he Smith got injured and missed the next game and top and had a nice little run and basically reclaim that starting role Nesmith is still been the guy closing games he's been in the closing lineup for the Pacers most nights yeah just great hustle great effort I do think in deeper League's he is a fantasy option topping has been hot from the field is rebounding is terrible for guys six nine but he has been hot shooting six of eight and was against six of eight in the Bucs win he's on a bit of a tear we'll see if he keeps that going but so Alex tell us about Saturday well Saturday the in season tournament Championship final title game I don't know what you call it Pacers vs Lakers that's tomorrow the game does not count for Fantasy or regular season totals when it gets 500,000 dollars for each player and maybe each coach can't quite remember  so we have to ask Shannon who do you have for this game  tough I I'm gonna take the Pacers whoa I believe in Haliburton I mean LeBron add the Lakers are playing really well and it certainly looks like you know LeBron his stated that he wants this you know on he wants to have the interest in season tournament be the first one of you know the first champion in season tournament champions so LeBron's definitely motivated and he's playing Super well but I I Believe In The Halliburton magic and I think this is just part of his full Breakout  you know I I'm with Shannon I'm taking the Pacers too I just don't think those Laker guards can keep up  the pace with the Pacers and Halliburton I see buddy hield getting some open threes I just don't see D'Angelo Russell or Reeves  I think they ought to give a lot of minutes to cameras she's the only one I think that might be able to keep this pace going but I just think they're gonna run LeBron and AD off the floor  I'm gonna take the Lakers kind of regularly because I do love with the Pacers are doing but it's a home game for them I mean like it's it is yeah I mean I well I so as as a quick aside I think having the Lakers  in the finals  you know Nick free Del tweeted that it would be such a big the that the league needs the Lakers or the Knicks or these big markets in the finals I think specifically having the Lakers in the finals for this game is massive for the optics for the NBA because if you were paying attention on Twitter and even watching that box Pacers game last night the crowd was like  non-existent like it was horrible I mean it was people were taking pictures who were in the crowd it was like 50% full you know they dimmed the lights around you can't tell nobody's there they're blaring music so the atmosphere seems better I mean it's a terrible atmosphere for the first game seriously but the Lakers game short drive from La it makes sense right I mean all the fans are there we knew would be kind of home game I remember in the betting picks article yesterday I pointed out I had the Lakers have like they give up like eight fewer points on defense per game when they play at home versus the road and yeah as you said that sounded like and look like a home Laker crowd which is geography wise makes a lot of sense well I don't I don't think the NBA is going to go with a Thursday 2 p.m. Pacific tip off for the for the in season semis next year that's certainly didn't help and and it made me realize too I know I have to look up the data on this but I have some experience with those those unexpected or the you know Day games in the NBA are pretty rare you have you might have some on Saturdays and Sundays but but players gonna be accustomed to that but having them during the week is super rare right you have like MLK day and that's about it maybe some other holidays where they would do it but it doesn't happen very often and I know I've been in Vegas for multiple MLK days actually one of my favorite days of the year because you have NBA from like 9 a.m. all the all the way through the end of the night and those early games they often fall that they hit the under on a very regular basis and the  Pacers Bucks game is a prime example I mean that game had a ridiculous the line was ridiculous I think 50 something to 25757 years yeah there you go and as soon as it started you know it started off pretty slow in the first quarter I was like dang I should have I should have actually thought about that early tip off time and just how players aren't accustomed to doing that and it probably you know they probably will take a little while to get into their groove well there was some news outside of the in season tournament that broke yesterday not great for Shannon's Pistons  Jalen Duren is now out two weeks with more ankle issues you know because the Pistons need more bad news now during Miss seven games in November due to similar ankle issues Shannon is the opportunity for beef stew Bagley or Wiseman  well  one thing I'm certainly not going to do is try to pretend like I can predict what Monty Williams would do with his starting rotation his rotation as a whole you know during his Miss games in the past we had we had we had Bagley get those starts I think that's the most likely scenario is vaguely gets plugged in his starting lineup a beef stew yeah I know a lot of Pistons fans are calling for beef Stewie get moved up to the five reinsert a sour Thompson into the starting lineup alongside by zdanowicz Kade and then Haze or ivy um  beef stew just doesn't have the size to be to be a center I think the rebounding is going to suffer significantly he's 6 8 he has no vertical Marvin bagley's a mess on defense but he has he has more size and he can actually jump off the floor so Marvin Bagley or Wiseman I would say are more likely to get spot starts in place of Jalen Duren but hopefully you know my kids surprise and go beast to it does definitely prolong beef stews viability as a fantasy option I think we will eventually get to a point maybe it's not until January where you know it's gonna definitely not going to be until after during returns but beef stew will become obsolete at some point this season this just gives them an extra few weeks where he will be able to contribute if you're in 12 team or deeper leaks  you know I was I was surprised when I went to you know we put together our waiver wire picks and I want to see beef stews roster percentage that's a 56 I was like that is shocking I was gonna I was gonna make him one of my pickups I was like can't do it too many people have them already talk about that situation more power forward but now it's now bogdanovich's back so that he's on as Shannon says he's kind of on the clock here we'll see how much she's got left  all right gentlemen oh I also want to happy birthday shout out today to Boston Celtic and wisconsinite slam Houser happy birthday slam

guys let's go to our live fan feedback have some excellent questions in the feed I'm going to start with this one John Collins for Cameron Johnson trade any thoughts on that fellas  um because that's like an interesting like deeper League like bench guy for bench guy trade look Collins has been pretty good lately you know with like marketing out Kessler's coming off the bench stuff like that he's still like not he's still barely inside the top 100 I believe it's not really blossomed with marketing and out like you'd kind of hope  yeah he's he's a little more involved but he still like outside the top 100  I would rather have Cam Johnson to kind of put a poll on he's just proven to have higher upside at this point and Johnson or Collins I should say Colin says is having his opportunity and he's not taking advantage of it so I think it's I think it's just over right like it the the hope of John Collins being like a top 50 player again just gone gone all right let's and this one let's start with this one oh I'm gonna go with Cam Johnson cam Johnson as well as special if you need or three pointers you know he's the obvious choice there I was not been healthy this season yet I don't think we've seen the best of Cam Johnson this year yeah and he is you know he's starting for the Nets even after cam Thomas returned from Injury camp Johnson stayed in the starting lineup so it is Cam Johnson you know their Jack Collins is at risk of once Kessler gets healthy one so when it gets healthy and marking and that he could lose minutes if not a starting Spot somewhere down the line because he's the one different he's the thing that's different from the team last year they had early Seasons success last year  they have John Collins like in the starting lineup this season and they're not nearly as effective so I could see him getting moved out of the rotation at some point as well the starting rotation all right Shannon you still you take this one Zach traded CJ McCollum for Drew holiday would like to get your thoughts I like it I think it's solid it's pretty pretty even trade you know essentially if you have bigger needs in one area you want more steals you go with holiday holiday typically will have better percentages as well CJ might offer more upside on the three pointers but things like assist are typically pretty pretty even I think holiday might be might be a little bit higher on assist this year than he usually is though but it's a fairly even trade and I don't think there's like one huge winner one way or the other  think I would side with CJ and but but again I'm not gonna I'm not gonna Hammer either side as a true winner  I might lean the other way one by us to Celtics but all so a little word about CJ's lung issue in whether that's cleared up or not and  so I could you know you're not going to deal him if he's uh out another week or two because of that all right one last one this one back to you Alex another holiday but not nearly as high ranked nickeil Alexander Walker or Aaron holiday you are you a 20 Team league sir um these are our people Alex please know I know look I know um holiday yeah holiday hit the popped off or like 22 points the other day kind of randomly  I you know I Won't Say I'm like worried in a massive way about his minutes with a man Thompson coming back but I would say that gives me some concern of course on the other hand with Alexander Walker you have Jacob McDaniels who's going to come back I mean honestly I wish I could tell you neither like is this a trade is this like a waiver wire situation  I might  I mean I think Aaron holiday just how about just the next week or two  she can do have a strong opinion on this I'll pivot to you because yeah yes the answer is no you know Nakia Alexander Walker is the answer that's who I prefer neither one of them has great upside as been established by their play this season and past years but Alexander Walker you know if for some reason we get an absence from an extended absence from Edwards Alexander Walker will be asked to take on a heavier load that's why he had that one big 53-point Fantasy game I think it might have been the game that that  the ant was injured in so I'm going with Alexander Walker I I agreement when when a man Thompson returns and we're gonna talk a little bit more about amen Thompson later when he returned holiday is out of the rotation he is like five minutes for game Max there he he's just not that guy even in spot starts he is well below a Fantasy Point per minute in spots for his career you know you're basically you're looking at one big performance he's had two 30-point fantasy Port performance is this year and the most recent one came on December 6th so that's why he's being brought up but I would not overreact to that performance I expect him to be out of the lineup very out of the rotation very soon because tops and probably returning within the next few days all right excellent advice gentleman Alex take us now to the waiver wire  it's waiver wire time ladies and gentlemen um if you are new to the segment this is how we do it we each have three suggestions two of those are quote unquote regular picks rostered in 50% of fewer of typically Yahoo leagues one long shot pick typically roster in 25% or fewer Yahoo leagues this week upcoming week I should say this upcoming week all but 16 play four times those six teams have three games so after a short week this week with the season tournament the NBA's making it up next week by destroying everybody's knees ankles hips etc for the ratings Alex yeah we'll see about that um your number one pick here  my number one pick is Shannon's Kelly and Hayes 28% roster Detroit Pistons like I we you know Nick and I did our Monday podcast and we got so many questions about the Pistons they are the number one team garnering the most questions from fans at this point do I drop us our Thompson do I drop beef stew what's going on with Duran what's going on with j and Ivy look nobody knows nobody knows what's going on he doesn't know Monty doesn't know what's going on he's spins a wheel every morning to determine his starting lineup but Kelly and Hayes started the past three games he started much of the Season before that he's averaging 164 and 4 during this stretch  he's 28% roster so he's available in most League's I think he's just worth picking up just to see if it continues like he is worth having on a 12 team roster if he's played 30 minutes a game for his assist and steals upside I'm not gonna tell you that he won't start coming off the bench again because it's won't continue to go back and forth but it's at least worth acknowledging that he is starting now shooting he's shooting has gone from horrendous to just poor that's great for Killian yeah yeah I mean he was you know high 30s now he's almost 43% field goal percentage which is a huge upgrade  Ken who is your first suggestion well first let me say fans if you like our videos please hit like And subscribe below  I have two names that we mentioned last week and I'm going to repeat it my first two picks this week the first one is Center Derek Lively of the Dallas Mavericks he's rostered in 55 percent of teams on Yahoo some cheating a little but only 16% on ESPN he is being get with it the rookie is the starting center for Dallas I can't stress that enough he is their starting center the Mavericks like most teams have four games next week and Lively's four games since returning from a minor back issue he is averaging ten and a half points seven and a half rebounds and here's the huge one three point three blocks a game while shooting 803% from the field dunks from Luca tend to juice your field goal percentage  look there's an old team that needs some young legs and Lively has that plus finally finally given the Mavs some Rim protection  he's a he's gonna be annoying if you if you're in a daily lineup League or you're playing DFS because it's performance is up and down but over over the long term over a period of a whole week two weeks a month whatever it all evens out he's gotten better pretty much every single game it seems like he's he's improving  Shannon was your first suggestion all right I'm gonna go with a guy that has been around for a while Derek Jones you know he's he's bouncing around between Phoenix Miami Portland Chicago he's in Dallas this year  oddly he's only 26 I swear he was older than that but he's putting together a career year he's basically been locked into the Mavericks starting lineup starting all but one game this season and he's picked up his production of late over the past three games or four games three of which were starts is averaging 16.8 points 4.5 rebounds one steal and 3.33 pointers he shooting 50% from the floor and 80% from the line over that four game stretch the Mavericks  are going to have to find players that work well alongside Luca and Kyrie Josh greens out right now Grant Williams out so Derek Jones is benefit benefiting some from that but he gives them a defensive presence on the wing he can hit three-pointers you know I I don't think the values going to be sustained for a long stretch but for as long as he's playing this way and playing 30 minutes or more per game I think he's worth a look in definitely 14 teams and possibly 12 teams if it's a deep deep enough roster always good to blocks for a wing and Josh Green's out probably two weeks at least so there's a big opportunity yeah only 13% roster down Yahoo  there we go Alex who's your second pick  Alex Caruso of the Chicago Bulls who is 39% rostered Zach lavine's out three to four weeks which means two things one Caruso is going to play more to the Bulls are gonna continue winning games Levine has missed the past three games crucial got hurt in the second game but in the first and third game Saw 29 minutes and 30 minutes which is obviously very good in just 24 minutes per game this season it was ranked 91st so if he seen closer to 30 minutes per game for a month uh you gotta added basically he's a he's mostly a steel specialist he'll get you some blocks from the guard position and some assists as well but he's a really good spot with with Levine out for potentially up to a month and maybe having played his last game in a Bulls jersey yeah that's true he's a top of a lot of trade rumors I guess they like that people like that contract  I think the Bulls dislike it and are hoping someone else will find it tolerable  you talk about Levine or Caruso oh Levine oh I was talking about Caruso sorry oh no yeah Caruso's awesome they got showcase him right uh Ken who is your second suggestion also a repeat from last week my apologies but saddiq Bey starting forward for your Atlanta Hawks he's 52% rostered on Yahoo 20% on ESPN he started the last five games for the Hawks and over those starts he's averaged 14 and a half points six and a half boards 2.6 triples and 1.2 steals while shooting a red hot 58% from the field and 90% from the charity stripe hey Jalen Johnson is out till after Christmas they had a big 21.7 rebound game on Wednesday before the end season stuff and the Hawks have four games next week hey bay is a streaky outside shooter a plan while he's hot  Ikea captain Lee say the Pistons would have twice as many wins if he was still there  yeah what did they get in that betrayed I forget what what  Shannon yeah who's your second suggestion here before you go on Pistons rant I'm gonna take I'm gonna take my recommendations to South Beach and highlight Caleb Martin you know the playoff breakout star for the Heat last year 28 year old forward Caleb Martin started his first game for the heat on December 6th against Toronto had a monster game 24 points 12 rebounds three assists 9 for 16 from the floor four for seven from downtown  46 fantasy points his role has steadily grown since returning to action he was out the first part of the season with an injury but he's now played ten straight games  I believe we will see Caleb Martin play about 28 30 minutes for game for the heat he is definitely a hold in 14 lempiras  I like cable Martin I like what he can do for for Fantasy rosters and I'm not a believer in Highsmith so Haywood Highsmith has been the starting power forward I I wouldn't be surprised if the heat just go with a smaller lineup moving forward and I do think there's a chance Caleb Martin could stick in that and that starting spot for an extended stretch here and short term they really need Martin scoring in that starting lineup while bams out we'll see what's bolster does what bam comes back but yeah they can't afford a Heisman when they all have what is it Orlando Robinson Center which yeah Orlando Robinson I think it's we should highlight him he's not one of our our top waiver wire picks but he has been  pretty damn good in spot starts for bam over the past two games 31 minutes 15 points and a half rebounds 1.5 steals if you need a big man you know if we daily weeks or Lando Robinson is worth a look to be determined how long Bam's going to be out but it's last week I mentioned Thomas frying it is not Thomas frying it is Orlando Robinson so that's the guy if you're looking for a big man to pick up  Alex who's your long shot for this week  Marvin Bagley you 9% rostered I feel like I should like have a like a down Jaylen durrance out two weeks as a starter bagley's averaging 13 and 6 you know like I we have to see what the Pistons do tonight I think that's important Friday night how they approach during being out as we alluded to earlier in the show Bagley has been starting averages 13 and 6 with almost to assist like a block like that's fine to start special before game we can to 12 Team league but with Marty Williams you just never know maybe they start Wiseman maybe they shift Isaiah Stewart up to the five bringing a new starting five so just see what the Pistons do tonight but tentatively speaking Marvin Bagley is an ad and badly have an opportunity I don't trust money to stick with any five during these two weeks I think he'll be constantly  tinkering as they lose more and more  we'll see we'll see I hope you're right about Marvin  who's your Longshot Ken  today I shifted from my usual long shot to my a more natural boring pick of the week which we used to also do in Prior Seasons I'm going to DFS Dorian Finney Smith is Rossford in 25% of legs Finney Smith now qualifies as a forward Center on Yahoo I don't know why okay but he does Brooklyn has four games next week in dfs's last five games 12 points six boards 2.2 stocks which is always been good at and 2.63 over almost 33 minutes a game he's shooting 50% from the field frankly the Nets needs Finney Smith's defense in there I think is gonna keep getting monster minutes just a nice streaming option when the Knicks how the Nets have four games as they do this upcoming week but it is boring he lacks upside but a nice safe streaming option for you and with DFS is well you know he did move to reserve role when cam Thomas returned but  he still played 30 minutes off the bench yeah I mean the most recent game on December 6th so I like it I like it can't my long shot of the week  going with I'm going with amen tops and yeah I've been really thinking about it praying and that's the answer he he's been out right he's been out since early November with an ankle injury but he is now healthy and he is on assignment with the Rio Grande Valley vipers in the G League  and he made his g-league debut earlier this week and had an absolutely Monster game 29.16 rebounds 11 assists three steals two blocks in 40 minutes  this guy is Bonkers he's the better of the you know coming at least going into the draft he was considered the better of the tops in twins and everyone saw how solid assar was the first couple weeks of the Season before Monty started tinkering with things in Detroit Amy Thompson is is more of a stash though 10 team 12 team leads it's not even worth it you're benches aren't deep enough but if you're in a 14 16 Team league deeper format where he is available and you have room on your bench to stash someone he's more of a second half of the Season guy as far as upside goes I do think he's going to knock a guy like Aaron holiday on the rotation for the Rockets and long term he could even take minutes from guys like Dillon Brooks Dillon Brooks had a great start to the season and he's coming off a good game against Oklahoma City but he has a lot of stinkers in between and I won't be surprised if this team depending on where they are in the standings want to start giving minutes to Tops and he has the size even though he was drafted as a point guard played primarily as a point guard last year you know he has size where they could plug them in at the tour of three and he played alongside jail and green and Fred Vance Lee  depth of the Rockets is just annoying it like why is 37 year old Jeff Green on this roster Terry Easton deserves more minutes Jason Tate  she play or not I don't know what makeup your freaking mind like Aaron you know just what are you doing with Kim Whitmore you're not going to develop what more at all with all these old guys I just just know what Reggie Bullock is on this team what the hell's going on in Houston  I don't know but they're nine to nine we hey welcome to the middle congratulations yeah okay let's uh it's probably time to go to wave or uh yes Alex take us to the Friday DFS picks advice from you and Shannon every team in the league plays today except the Pacers and the Lakers so get ready for a huge day of DFS I just over under is a modest 241 and a half from the Hawks at the 76ers look we got a bunch injuries today to prominent players to reims out try Young's game time decision we got Jalen Duren we talked about her singing this is probably gonna come back and you'll gaffer's questionable Everly's questionable bands out Levine's out marketing and still out so just check it you know check the lineups check the world of wire injury page all that lineup optimizer  check the optimizer  absolutely when you but Shannon when you look at today's slate  is there one specific place your eyes go first well we talked about him a little bit earlier but Orlando Robinson is is our highest value of the night he is 5500 on FanDuel as mentioned bam edit bios out already for Friday night's game and Orlando Robinson's going to get the spot start he's coming off a very solid outing in which he had  46 fantasy points in 33 minutes 15 points 12 rebounds three three steals one block 5500 he's going up in price of salaries definitely higher than it was a week ago but he's still a very solid value at that place so that's I mean immediately whether it's on FanDuel or DraftKings that's the guy who I played in my lineup first  yeah I think it's a good option not an easy matchup necessarily going up against Cleveland but I think they'll need him out there I was a little worried when they were going he were going up against a Raptors that they would maybe try some small ball get the you know but I don't think they'll do that here and they've proven like Orlando Robinson you know some other interesting matchups I think here you have Detroit versus Orlando um you know we talked about Jalen Duren being out we'll see what they do there I think there's some Betsy or movagar opportunities I'm curious about Cole Anthony going up against the back quarter the Detroit Pistons without Jalen Suggs available I think that could be a big opportunity for him to have a big game after we saw well what was it that's been banned for was it 499 it's it's not just Desmond Bane either it's awesome I I've been telling everyone you know go go the over for whatever lead guard is facing the Pistons go the over you had D'Angelo Russell go for like 60 fancy points last week against the Pistons then he had Bronson drop over 60 points and then Bane head over 70 fantasy points gets pissed and whoever The Weeknd is and tonight with the magic it's definitely cool Anthony call Anthony probably won't  even start they'll probably start yeah 25 plus minutes yep he will they'll probably start Aunt black and and Gary man I wanted to call him Gary sucks but that's not right Gary Harris because Jalen Suggs and and fultz are both out or Suggs is game time decision questionable right now I would be surprised if he played based on the exit that he took in the previous game was that all right yep just got ruled out this morning actually so he is out now so that I mean that leaves the opportunity it's gonna be Gary Harris and black Cole Anthony are going to be the guards Cole Anthony's the guy he's already put together monsters fancy performance fantasy performances this year he's not cheap he's 7100 on FanDuel but I would not be surprised to see him have a monster game against Pistons  Alex you know the big that big over under of 241 for the Hawks in Sixers who do you like in that game  yeah I mean I think this is a good opportunity well look I mean Trey Young's questionable so keep an eye on that um but you know I if young is out it's in theory you want to go to Shante Murray but he'll probably put it probably have the Anthony Melton treatment which will make it a big of a struggle for him that's that's kind of interesting to me look I don't think capella or a Kong who could really deal with him be either I kind of lean towards him bead there Hunter and bear like decent cash options or we just need to line up filler you know because they're starting to buy Harris and two on the wing either those guys are good Defenders so that's an option there I will say well guy I like have a slate outside of this game Anthony Edwards are going up against the Memphis Grizzlies they don't have any buggy to guard him it's I mean that could end up being like we could see like a 49 point game I'll get Edwards so I like him as like a pay up option  you know this is a we have Boston versus New York can we've seen these teams play what twice already at least Nick's always bring it against Boston I don't know what it is  I think the Knicks view this is a rivalry I'm not sure the Celtics do  you know presenting is clearly not gonna be 100% coming back from his calf injury so I could see another big game from Randall Quinn Grimes griping about his role by the way recently I don't know what that's all about it like Quinn be happy that you're starting in the NBA but um  I'm I'm I am worried about the Seas tonight  they've had lots of time to prep for this but I Nick's always bring it against Boston and I can't explain why yeah it must be tough worrying about a 15 and 5 Team all right so it's a burden you know what one other team I want to highlight for DFS purposes Portland we've got Jeremy Grant's already been ruled out eight and was listed as doubtful last I checked yeah it looks like he's unlikely to play which opens up some things in the front court for Portland you have Kamara received a spot start in the most recent game over for at power forward in place of Grant and then you know it's always fun when there's just a totally unexpected name I have a fully admit I've never heard this guy's name spoke in allowed but do up Reef yes is again to be the starting center again for Portland assuming 8 and doesn't indeed sit out he started the most recent game for Portland  and put up yeah decent game 22 minutes 10.6 rebounds one steel one block yeah he'll get another start tonight most likely tomorrow will Jabari Walker was heavily owned in the December 6th slate with Grant out but he ended up coming off the bench and play as many minutes as most folks expected if for some reason Walkers announces the starter I like him for tonight's late over Kamara I don't know if that'll happen in which case I'm probably avoiding the power forward spot but do operationally on DraftKings I think is a solid value and that's a that's a roster where you can start to centers and can even go Orlando Robinson and do up  you know I love about do up 27 year old two-way contract I didn't even know it was legal to give a two-way contract to someone that old  but good for him good for him I hope he has a baller game tonight only only player ever to play in the NBA out of Lee College before he went to LSU Nas redes alma mater um you know you love some nasri yes I do anything else on this late Shannon before we before we wrap things up it covers it let's go get those bags  okay well it's time Ken for your old man rant  ah hey New Orleans Pelicans how about trying the pills were terrible last night they almost single-handedly ruined the whole in season tournament New Orleans shot 36% from the field Brandon Ingram wasn't this a Revenge game for you overhyped Zion shot one for six from the free throw line both of these fours were a minus 30 in point differential which is basically over three quarters because it was such a blow up they got yanked did these two guys play poker all night Wednesday what the heck  spelled 17 points in the third quarter veteran CJ McCollum shot four of 14 and was a minus 38 Point differential minus 30 the Lakers out rebounded in New Orleans 59 to 42 Pals you'll always be a small Market afterthought with crap efforts like this bank and picking out a small Market I wouldn't expect anything else from a Celtics fan  you're welcome yeah um I think we avoided any mispronounced names today we got the doop wreath mention which is awesome but that that will wrap it up for us thank you everybody for joining us on the roadwire fantasy basketball podcast because presented by Underdog fantasy Ken take us out of here let's go back to Las Vegas we're on TNT Charles Barkley roasted Zion Williamson after the pals got blown out by those Lakers Charles said quote the thing that disturbs me is he's not a young kid
