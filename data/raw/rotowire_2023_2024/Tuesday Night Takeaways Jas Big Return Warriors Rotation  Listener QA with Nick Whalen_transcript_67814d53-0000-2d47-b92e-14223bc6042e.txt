welcome into the RotoWire NBA podcast it is Wednesday December 20th I am Nick Whalen no Brady Kravitz today he's sick he's got sick kids at his house it's a holiday week so he's got the day off we're gonna go solo do probably a shorter version of the Pod today we'll open it up a little bit earlier to some Q&A try to hit as many of those as we can so as always if you're listening if you're watching live on YouTube or on Twitter feel free to talk you know some questions some comments in the Stream and we will hit those as we go along so again this will probably be a bit of a shorter episode we'll talk about you know some of the Fallout some of the fantasy takeaways from Tuesday night but we're back to a more traditional MBA schedule so we only had two get our four games excuse me on the Slate last night obviously the big news to return of John Moran and could really could not have gone much better for Josh 34 points 8 assists six rebounds two Steals and a block you didn't turn it over five times when he was a plus 12 full workload 35 minutes you know we saw Taylor Jenkins earlier yesterday say yeah you know we're gonna be maybe a little careful with this minutes and then before tip-off it was probably playing the low 30s I mean they needed every minute of John Morant last night of course it's the game winner as well so kind of a storybook return as far as that goes for jaw 10 of 12  at the free throw line you took 24 Shots and we wondered what do you be rusty at all the answer is a pretty emphatic no I mean Chopper rant looked like Java rant last night and this is going to be a huge huge boost for Memphis the question is can the Grizzlies get back into the playoff race in the Western Conference and I would like to say yes but I mean they dug themselves a whole six in 19 in the first 25 games without John Moran and you know even after winning last night you know Phoenix lost golden state did win that was not good for Memphis but you know they are still six and a half back of the Phoenix Suns who are currently intense and of course that is a final you know play in spot so I you know they're gonna have to go they're basically enough to win what 60% of their games at least the rest of the way to to have a chance to speak in there and to me it's tough to say all right if they're 13th right now do they eventually pass the Utah Jazz probably you know with a healthy jaw and a healthy Arcus smart if they have just relatively decent injury luck the rest of the way I think they do they do pass up you know I think I could you could see them passing up Golden State we'll see you know if the Warriors could get it together or if they make any roster changes beyond that though it's like you know what's the other team that falls out like I have a hard time saying yes this is going to pass the Phoenix Suns you know barring an injury to Durant or Booker I don't think that's happening you know Houston is maybe that team that could fall back there at 13 and 11 right now you know the defense has been fantastic but they're they're deep they're talented I don't think they're that's fairly due for a big slide and then above that you got the Lakers the pals the Clippers they've won eight in a row Dallas Sacramento Denver okay see Minnesota you know most of those teams you feel pretty good about you know hanging around where they are right now current seating  wise so I think they're going to need they're gonna need some help they're gonna need some injury looks so bad injury look for other teams the crawl back into the playoff race but frankly if you're Memphis when you don't want to throw away a season you know we're only 26 games in but if they you know failed to gain ground you know there's still six seven games out of even a play-in spot at the halfway point or after the All-Star break maybe it would be the worst thing you know for the Grizzlies to have a lottery Pick and add another piece to this core because Jazz still young Jackson still young you're kind of resetting now around that core and you probably need to find a long-term answer was Steven Adams missing so much time at Center these last couple of Seasons but regardless you know huge huge return for John Moran really could not have gone better you know if you threw out there in a weekly fantasy lineup he kind of didn't really know what to expect and didn't know if he'd be in a minute how Rusty he would be you know really could not have gone better so great to have John ramp back Memphis is back in Action tomorrow they are home for the Indiana Pacers I mean that is that's gonna be a hell of an environment John's first home game back coming off of the game winner and really an ideal fantasy  matchup as well against an Indiana team that is just ending up points to anybody so if you got job around in your lineup good stuff there  elsewhere last night you know I actually want to stick with Memphis first so they win that game 115 113 Jared Jackson 24 points took only 10 shots but got to the line 15 times I mean that is a huge huge you know kind of change of pace for Jared Jackson who would probably a little bit underqualified to to carry a team offensively you know it was him and Desmond Bane through the first 25 games of the season and to varying success right I mean we saw Jared Jackson have some pretty high volume nights the efficiency has not really been there the field goal percentage is way down I think a lot of that a lot of that was predictable you know when you watched Aaron Jackson he's not he's not a great ball handler he could be a little out of control at times he's never shot a great percentage as far as big man go but you know I hope as someone who has Jared Jackson in a bunch of important League's is that you know the return of a rant kind of standardizes who he's supposed to be he goes back to the role that he played last season which is still a very good offensive player someone you can give you close to 20 a night he's never gonna be a great rebounder that's just not really who he is he's got that Brooke Lopez stat profile in some ways but I think you know taking some of the offensive pressure off of him allowing him to focus more defensively three blocks last night for Jaron Jackson that was fantastic so my hope is that continues and again a really good matchup for Memphis on Friday against the Indiana Pacers on the New Orleans side of things big game for Brandon Ingram 11 of 18 from the field 11 of 12 at the line 34 points 6 assists four boards two steals balance units and we talked about him on the road a wire MBA Show on Sirius XM last night Alex and I both loved him to have a big game he goes for 22 and 14 we cashed our you want us to over point five steals prop as well that was great took pretty deep into the game yeah I was talking with Alex last night you know Memphis turns it over a decent amount there near the top of the league in turnovers they're near the top of the league in a potent steals per game they're actually number one in that metric they turned it over 17 times last night and somehow that only resulted in four total steals for the Pelicans and at one point Memphis had a 12 turnovers early and only one of those resulted in his steal  so that's a bit of a fluky stat if you're looking at at the betting side of things but big night for Valentine's and then CJ McCollum 18 points all of which came on three six of nine from Beyond The Arc he only took two two points miss both of those added in six assists a steal and a block you know the train Murphy thing is something we've been monitoring quite a bit on this part I have a huge fan of Trey Murphy he played 21 minutes off the bench last night just seven points two of six shooting only took one three-pointer you know we've gotten a lot of questions on these streams about Murphy and you know can he returned to the player that he was last season  you know on a per minute basis my answer is always yes I think he's really really good I think he's going to be you know one of the knockdown shooters in the NBA for a long time but you gotta remember I mean he started 65 games last year he's now played in Eight games this year he's coming off the bench he's averaging six fewer minutes per game  no one was basically without Zion for all of last season right and I think that played to train Murphy's benefit in a way that it is not so far this year so Zion were to go down then yeah I think Trey Murphy becomes like a 30 333 minute per game player but as long as I was in the lineup I think you're going to get  about the same you know kind of permit numbers for Trey Murphy but maybe a little bit lower ceiling now last night was easily is worst game of the year so you know even with that factory in any still averaging more points more rebounds more than he did last season so you still a fine fantasy asset but you know as long as  as long as I am healthy I think there is a little bit of a lower ceiling for Trey Murphy Bucs took care of the Spurs 132 1/19 really this game nice job by the Spurs to come back and cover it in the fourth quarter they outscored Milwaukee 3425 in the final period Alex and I you know we talked about that game on the radio and basically like look we're not taking Milwaukee minus 16 and a half this is just screaming backdoor cover that's exactly what happened but the books the books completely dominated this game you know 44 points in the first quarter not a huge scoring night at all three honest four of 12 from the field in what should have been a perfect matchup I mean no weapon Yama for the Spurs but just kind of an off night for him offensively but 16 assists 14 boards two Steals and a block so kind of a unique triple double for Giannis 116 and 14 it was a little night arguably his best offensive game for Milwaukee you know so basically a three quarters of garbage time but we will take it 7-3 for Lillard you know feels like every game he starts like old four from three that was not the case last night he was hot from start to finish 40 points four assists three boards and three steals for Damian Lillard Kelvin  Johnson went 28 and 12:22 and two blocks for Zach Collins we did have a Shane Sharpe injury that's something to monitor I'm a very big shade and sharp guy you know the volume has been down a little bit the numbers have been down since Anthony Simons came back but he left early last night against the subject he played only eight or nine minutes dealing with a groin injury so that will be that will be something to monitor you know if you're in Daily leaks obviously not as big of a deal hopefully he plays they play tomorrow at home against Washington that should be a very very good matchup but concerning loss last night for the Phoenix Suns you know it's also reporters for the sons on Twitter we're like this is this might be a players only meeting type of loss you know Phoenix now 14 and 13 on the year Durant went for 40 Booker gave you 26 and 7 really nobody else did anything for the Phoenix Suns you know they go five of 23 from Beyond The Arc as a team you know it's one of those games for Portland where they went 14 of 28 and you know if you're out scoring a team that badly from three you're gonna win a lot of games in the NBA but it's not important played all that well and they only shot under 45% as a team it was really the threes that that ended up pulling this game out for them Malcolm coming off the bench 32 minutes he had four three is 14 points four assists decent day for Anthony Simon see a 23 and 7 but again only nine of 23 from the field 8 and 16 and  15 and Jeremy Grant got to do it with Jeremy Grant does he's putting up those Carmelo Anthony stat lines 22 points one rebound four assists did have two blocks as well all right we got some questions in the chat again if you're just tuning in know Kravitz today you deal with an illness he is listed as a game time decision going forward should be back on the stream next week so we're going solo here keep the questions coming I think that will that will prevent me from just you know rambling on and on about last night's games I've got a question from a dither hopefully I'm pronouncing that correctly he says appreciate your work and your advice thank you appreciate that help me please is that hold pajewski or drop to pick up trayce Jackson Davis he is in a Yahoo head-to-head 12 Team 15 category League well 15 categories that I would like to know what those extra categories are you know we've gotten a lot of questions  about branded pajam ski of late and rightfully so I you know he went for I think it was 29 dollars in Fab in a 100 dollar budget League that I'm in 16 teams over the weekend so you know somebody that I think has has staying power but played only 16 minutes last night you know he's been starting for them they move Andrew Wiggins to the bench Wiggins had  yet another disaster game last night you know he had played well in their last game but man two of 11 from the field in 22 minutes 6 points seven rebounds I mean this is just been a brutal brutal  start to the year for Andrew Wiggins and you know I think trayce Jackson Davis that's kind of the storyline for the Warriors who were able to Rally back just by Steph Curry pick it up five or his fifth foul I think in the third quarter you know LED them to an overtime win and just yet another game where you kind of get concerned about the late game offense for the Boston Celtics but but Jim ski you know left that game with a lower back injury that was according to Kendra Andrews ESPN so wasn't it wasn't like he got benched if you're just looking at the box score you might think okay why do you play 16 minutes you know we'll see on him you know as far as what his status will be going forward the Warriors are they're often they're off tomorrow and then they have a really really juicy back-to-back both of these are home games against Washington and Portland Friday and Saturday so hopefully pajam skis back for that looking forward next week they have a three game week they have a four game week after that and then three three three you know through the first few weeks of January so not a not a great schedule necessarily for the Warriors  I think I would still I would still favored pajem ski over Jackson Davis now yeah trayce Jackson Davis was one of the big stories for the Warriors last night had that huge block on Jalen brown but had three blocks total 10 points 13 boards in 29 minutes he played 18 minutes in their previous game against Portland at 14 and 8 with three assists and two steals in a block so I think he I think he's worth you know flyer at this point but still very very unproven right second round pick out of Indiana a guy was a great college player one of those classic like all right he's awesome in college but really do anything in the NBA but I think he found a good landing spot in Golden State and obviously we'll benefit as long as trademark green is out but he's still he still behind Jonathan coming up who played 34 minutes have one of his best games of the year 17/7 two and two last night the interesting thing was Kevon Looney only played 14 minutes and you know that's been a trend this year obviously he had so many great rebound he games toward the end of last season he's not been great for them you know the Warriors I think are still searching for that small ball option as long as Draymond is out and I think we're going to see more Trace Jackson Davis right I think early in the season Kerr was a little bit hesitant to to switch up this rotation to go you know go away from guys who he's trusted over the last couple of years I think that's out the window I think golden state is kind of in scramble mode right now especially without Draymond so we should be looking at a nice little run here for Jackson Davis where I think he's going to get minutes he's going to get opportunities again I would still if I'm using between the two assuming pajewski you know it's not dealing with a longer term injury with this back issue I would still favored him but if you need if you need blocks if you need rebounds then you know I think trayce Jackson Davis makes sense as a streamer  all right yeah asked is Colby white and cam Thomas sell High candidates  good question I mean you know I've said all along with Kobe white like he's he's I mean this is a highest that is value spend throughout his career at any point by a mile right and it's been ridiculously consistent you know you kind of still waiting for the like come back to earth stretch for Kobe white and you look at his last 15 games  excuse me 23.4 points 5.6 assists 5.2 boards 50 50 86% ages and again this is a 15 game samples it doesn't just like three or four games he's been hot so yes he's a sell High you know what I could consider what I consider flipping him for somebody who you know has a more proven track record who has you know more upside the rest of the way yes it's just a question of who can you really get at this point alright I'm trying to see where he ranks you know over the last 30 days which which encompasses you know you know most of that stretch he's a top 25 fantasy player  in eighth category leaks he's 24th overall he ranks right between Steph Curry and Chet Holmgren in terms of her game so yeah you could flip him if you could get you know I don't know somebody like I don't Scotty Barnes you know somebody's willing to part with you know injury risk type of player I don't know Paul George you probably can't get Kevin Durant somebody like that I might have to be a two for one type of deal if you might have to throw in another piece but I'm not really trying to get off of Kobe white like I think it's very possible that Zach LaVine has played his final game as a Chicago Bull I think they might just be kind of waiting to trade him and there's always the possibility that if they deal him or they dealed to rosin or even boosted if there's a taker there that yeah they could bring in some other young Talent you know who would cut into Kobe White's workload but I you know I think they view Kobe why is part of the future and this is a team that's been kind of cruising toward a rebuild for a while they've been putting it off but you know it's not like they're gonna bring in somebody and all the sudden Kobe watch playing 25 minutes off the bench right so you know he's playing 38 minutes game over the last 15 is that sustainable we'll see but I wouldn't really be looking to get off Kobe white right now I think what he's doing feels fairly sustainable and you know the Bulls are likely going to be a bad team the rest of the way but I think we're looking at a perfect you know good stats bad team situation for Kobe white and then you know with Cam Thomas  he's just been he's been so effective as a score that even though I I'm still questioning it is he actually a winning player I don't know that he is but the minutes have been there right since he came back from injury you know he started now eight games in a row 22 points 3 rebounds two assists and that span field goal percentage has a bit great you take it 47 shots over the last two games I mean that's who Camp Thomas is he's giving you a bunch of Threes as well you know he's if I'm  like if I'm forced to choose between selling one of those two it would probably be Camp Thomas just because there's fantasy profile isn't as friendly as Kobe White's but again I don't see either these as like short term booms I think what they're doing is is fairly sustainable and I guess you worry about Ben Simmons coming back and what does that mean but I don't know if that's even happening man I don't really have any trust in Ben Simmons  what do you think about Jalen Johnson I just came off the wire he was dropped last night and put him on IR he will take my one and only streaming spot I mean that's great I don't know why somebody would drop Jalen Johnson right now you know if you're in a really a little league 10 Team league yeah I could see it but you know to drop him  to drop him now when you know where should be nearing the end of his return timetable you know they said they would reevaluate him in three to four weeks and that was  excuse me that was around Thanksgiving so we're basically at the three and a half four week time table right now I think it's possible that he could be back in the next week or two so I I would understand dropping him you know at the time again if you're in a shallow league but jail Johnson was awesome early in the year and you know he's another guy who was playing a ton of minutes you know kind of when say he came out of nowhere he showed flashes but I did not see him you know being a 32 33 minute night guy  they have other options you'll get a bit just come on obviously DeAndre Hunter you know AJ Griffin their first rounder last year but I think jail Johnson's gonna plug back in when he returns from injury and yeah if you're stashing and I are spot and you could just if you're if you're streaming jail jobs and you're a great shape right you know if you streamer that's awesome I think it a lot of League you know 12 14 certainly 16 bleakz that's a guy who was you know a coveted every single week starter unless they're on a two game weeks so yeah great job grabbing him I don't again I don't know why somebody would put him on the waiver wire right now all right dub Force asks is a sar Thompson finally a drop and would you pick up James Wiseman  in place of him man I I just I love and hate talking about the Pistons I mean they've they've lost what 23 in a row now just a sad franchise a franchise that has a lot of pieces that we like  I think you know I think it's all probably has to be a drop you know he's back in the starting lineup he had that big game against Indy a couple of weeks ago and you're thinking all right you know maybe maybe we're back on track we're back to where we were in early November  and he started five games in a row his minutes have decreased in all five of those games he you know he's played 22 24 and 19 minutes over the last three games obviously the Pistons continue to get blown out every single night  2 points 8 boards three assists in a steal last time out I think he's probably droppable I think he is you know we we talked a lot about the return of bojanovic and you know how they use him well I mean they're playing him 30 35 minutes a night I don't know if it's a trade audition or what I do think later in the season you know a sar will end up seeing more minutes I don't know why they wouldn't turn things over to him but for right now you know it until they make some roster moves and you know really really go in the tank which is hard to find that they could go any lower I think he is a drop in you know for the time being I don't necessarily mind you know looking into James Wiseman I didn't think this was a conversation we'd be having but you know 26 258 minutes over his last three games you know Detroit could change the rotation on a whim that's the one thing you have to consider and obviously there without  Jalen Duren your last update on during game yesterday he still not practicing so I think you're probably got a week or two maybe before he's back at the soonest but the other thing is Stuart you know Isaiah Stewart is been out with the shoulder injury over the last two games that's a big part of the reason that wise men is in the lineup he's closer to day-to-day the other Pistons next game they play tomorrow against Utah then they played Brooklyn in Brooklyn on Saturdays so I think once I say Stuart comes back you know he's gonna cut into wiseman's wiseman's minutes but really when during comes back is when we could see the fall off so you know round about way of answering this question I think right now I'd rather have James Wiseman than a star Thompson if you're just looking at kind of a game to game or a week to week streaming option  all right Ian what's up in he says he's in a nine cat League Brogden in bogdanovich on Detroit or OG in a nobby so I guess it's a two-for-one you enjoy that broadened and bogged in which are OG I think I'd rather have Brogden and bogdanovich right now and an obese playing better he got off to a really slow start he was outside of the top 100 early in the season he has played better of late you know I think both buganda and broaden our trade candidates I think we have to consider that for sure but you know  OG and Obi right now is he's just not really giving you the defensive numbers I think that's the biggest thing you know he he's not really scoring consistently at this point so if you're giving me  a you know a two-for-one and in this situation would you guys who've been more productive and are both seeing a lot of minutes I would lean toward the log gain of itch and Malcolm Brogden side of things  Thiago asked I don't know if this is a resident or a you know relative of Tiago Splitter I don't think so but he says it's Spencer Dinwiddie a sell High  you know he might be a set I'll sell medium right you know I don't mind holding Spencer Dinwiddie you know I think the excuse me the injury to Ben Simmons has been has been big for him and you know Camp Thomas being back in the mix you know Brooklyn's mostly healthy right now and we haven't seen Spencer dinwiddie's minutes drop off whatsoever you know last 15 games he's averaging about 35 minutes per game he's giving you a ton of assists he's giving you steals as well you're gonna have to live with the bad percentages that's kind of who Spencer Dinwiddie is you know usually a sub 30% 3-point shooter it's been hovering around 40% from three but yeah I mean in terms of the assist production especially it's like now might be the time to to consider selling him but I also think you could ride this out if you can live with the percentages  all right Mark asks who would you keep keonte giddy or Trey Murphy in a nine Cat 10 Team league  interesting question I'm not I'm not the biggest he update George guy you know again if you're if you're in a category League especially a nine cat League you know the turnovers in the field goal percentage of just been disasterous I do think the minutes will be there I mean they've been basically for speeding in minutes whenever he's healthy thing for sure you're still getting still getting a decent number of counting stats from him but you know I think he's kind of the guy who's suffered most with with OKC upgrading its Talent this season and you know Jalen Williams taken a step forward at homegrown having some things to say in that rotation you know giddy over the last couple of weeks he's basically giving you what like 10 7 and 4 with a steel percentages aren't great you know not a good free throw shooter he doesn't take too many so that's not really that big of a concern I think I would lean Trey Murphy I would lean Trey Murphy and again I want Murphy because at some point Zion Williamson's probably getting hurt history would strongly suggest that and if that happens you know that we're looking at a 30 plus minute role for Trey Murphy so good question there you know I don't know if there's necessarily an obvious answer but if I'm choosing one of the three it's gonna be Trey Murphy  all right so back to a DC who was in the 15th plus field goals made free throws made three pointers made  double double of flagrant fouls oh I like that quite a bit so I wonder if Flagler vowels are are positive or A negative like do you do you watch Raymond Green in that league is that a category that you're targeting but interesting so thank you for the follow up the DIA Mark asks is Cade a sell High  since it looks like Detroit could take  yes and no I mean I they're already taking with him right you know it's like they're the worst team in the league by a mile they've won four games since the All-Star break last season I don't think there's any reason  I don't think there's any reason for them to pull back on Kate cuttingham it's not like he's in danger of winning them games so no he's been fantastic fantasy wise you know got off to a bit of a sluggish start but he's been really really good over the last couple of weeks I just went for a career high 43 the other night you I guess you could maybe worried about a late season shut down but you gotta you gotta keep in mind that the lottery odds are smooth now right I mean it as long as you're in that bottom four which Detroit's going to be in the bottom four I don't think that's gonna be a concern like there's no there's no reason to push for like truly the worst record in the league as opposed to the second or third or fourth worst record so I wouldn't worry too much about that I think Kate needs reps and I don't really see Detroit pulling back all that much so now I would I would still hold Kate I mean again if you if you can get a better player for him obviously you could trade anybody in that situation but I'm not really I'm not really worried about the tanking I mean Kate has been able to maintain his fantasy value despite the losing for Detroit all right let's see  we need to get a Jordan Poole question Guilford Wong says do I drop Jordan Poole  depends on your league size as always with these questions but he is droppable in in some formats you know I  I actually want to Jordan Poole in a lot of legs I didn't get him I wasn't really willing to pay the price and you know that's that's turned out to to be a good thing I suppose it is worth donating me Jordan pools played better of late in he's had these stretches throughout the season right I mean I think it was like right around Thanksgiving you a three straight really good games and then he was bad again for another couple weeks I mean those last three he's giving you 24 points five assists 51% from the field 50% from three had eight three-pointers the other night against Sacramento so if you're in like a 10 Team league he might be droppable and Guilford follows up and says should I drop him from Elite Beasley  I don't know if I do that you know Beasley's basically just a 3-point specialist right and yeah I guess you could say pool is kind of that in some ways but I think there's still more upside with Jordan Poole going forward you know he's at least playing more minutes than he was early on it was really concerning like first couple weeks of the Season he had some games where he's playing like 2021 minutes he has been closer to 30 32 over the last few weeks so if it's Beasley versus pool I would still hold pool all right would you trade away Derek Lively could the cell be too much to ask uh not necessarily Lively is an interesting one kind of a unique fantasy player right I mean not not somebody who I thought would be this successful right away I think he's a classic guy who you know number one recruit at times depending on where you look in his high school class didn't really look all that great at Duke last season but I think he's the type of player who's just better suited for the NBA game than he was in college you know you're really chasing the rebounds in the blocks and the field goal percentage with Lively he's not really a score he doesn't really pass he doesn't give you a lot of steals but he's up over two blocks per game over the last month you shoot 76% from the field I mean that is huge again that's a take that many only about six shots per game but that's gonna give you a nice boost to field goal percentage and then 8.1 rebounds per game so he ranks like 75th over the last month or so the cell writes quite a bit lower I mean if you need if you need points in threes then I think this is actually a fair deal but if you need the defensive  stats if you need a center eligible player I would probably just hang on to Lively I think the cell  the cell I worry about a little bit you know as far as taking goes like the Spurs and pop just kind of seemed to be operating on wins every single nightly the cells is one of their key pieces going forward so I don't think we're looking at a full shutdown but you just you just never really know what the Spurs rotation so I you know Lively's been the better fantasy player overall if it's not really a positional neat thing I would probably just stick with him all right so following up on the Dinwiddie question Thiago says you know should I worry about Ben Simmons coming back and affecting  dinwiddie's value yeah that's a fair question you know I again I we've been down this road so many times with Ben Simmons that  you know just when you think he's coming back you know there's a setback we really haven't gotten any word on him in a long time that gives us anything definitive you know they said in early December that he'd be out at least two more weeks it's now been three weeks since we got that update and they kind of seem to be handling him on a game to game basis he's dealing with you know a pinched nerve in his lower back he had an injection early in December so it's just you know it's one of those injuries where there's not really a firm timetable it's kind of a pain management thing you know Simmons is not played since November 6th I think he plays again at some point this year but is he gonna be a guy who plays 20 games in a row and is playing 30 minutes a night  maybe but probably not so I don't really worry all that much  about Ben Simmons specifically here I think we've again we know the track record with Simmons I don't think he's going to be able to stay healthy  all right so another question about Jackson Davis he's on waivers he was dropped just before his best game he was just used as a streamer as he appealing he's definitely appealing to me as a streamer you know we talked about the warrior schedule earlier in the Pod it's not super friendly write the rest of the week it is but they don't have many four game weeks coming up so when if you're looking at streamers and weekly lineups you know might be a little bit tough to justify but you know I also at this point the season there's not there's not that many obvious guys sending on the waiver wire right like in you know in Fantasy Football starting running back X goes down and it's like oh here's an obvious pivot right you know go pick up Jerome forward to Kareem hunt if Nick Chubb gets hurt in the NBA you're working the margins you're playing the trends a little bit more and again I think the Warriors the Warriors and Steve Kerr are open to anything at this point I think it is it is kind of become a you know egalitarian whoever's playing the best those are the guys that are going to get the minutes you know I think if you read between the lines on some of the things that Steve Kerr said over the last month or so that's the implication to me is that you know outside of Curry and Klay and you know I think on some nights you know comingo and Looney the rest of those spots and the rest of those minutes are very much up for grabs so I think as long as draymond's out and it sounds like he's gonna be out at least two or three more weeks if not longer I think we're gonna see a lot of trayce Jackson Davis I think it's really in matchups were there they're comfortable going small you know team that doesn't have a traditional Center out there you know we saw it last night against Boston know poor thing gets for the Celtics I think if he plays we probably see more Looney he only played 14 minutes last night but Al Horford's like yeah you could say he's a traditional Center all he doesn't shoot threes at this point he just kind of hangs around the perimeter ten of his 14 field goal attempts last night Came From Beyond The Arc so you might be a more of a matchup based thing which trayce Jackson Davis but  I think they're gonna try him out you know I think they're gonna run him out there they don't have a lot of other options with no Draymond so I do like him as a streamer and you know again they play Washington in Portland at home Friday and Saturday so if you're if you're in a daily lineup League I think both of those are really appealing matchups I mean you know Washington specialty one of the worst rebounding teams in the NBA I would be I think that could be a big night for Jackson Davis and he's got to kind of ride the hot hand right now and if we're talking about a streamer then I think he's a fine pickup all right guys you can keep the keep the questions coming in the Stream we'll keep this going as long as we can you know on a solo episode like this I'm not just gonna dribble on too long but you know I'm happy to answer any other questions that come through  get back to you know what happened in the NBA last night we only had four games on the Slate Dr little about Spurs books and Grizzlies Pelicans touchdown Celtics Warriors as well and then Suns Blazers you know  on the Portland side of things  you know DeAndre ayton nice little Redemption game for him against the Suns did only go six of 18 from the field but 15 boards 16 points will take that this is been a really interesting team to evaluate if you are a Batista Bible streamer as I am in one League you got your money's worth last night three Steals and a block in 21 minutes really don't care about anything else with him he did hit two three that's a nice bonus but you really just chasing the defensive stats  was not a great night for student Henderson he did play 30 minutes we love that and you know Shane sharp going out early with that groin injury certainly helped but three of nine from the field missed both of his threes did go three or three at the line good to see him getting there continues to foul at an absurd rate for fouls last night did a five turnovers that's killing you in a night category league but he finishes with 9 points 5 assists and four rebounds continue to be relatively underwhelmed with Scoot and my stance all along is that he he's going to improve I think there's going to be stretches where he looks really good I think he wasn't maybe quite as NBA ready as we thought you know the injury early on is working against him but in general you know players of his stat profile his age they just don't tend to be good fantasy players even if he has a nice stretch you know season long like his chances of ranking inside the top 100 top 120 even are pretty slow like rookie cards just very very rarely have the efficiency you know to do well in fantasy right away so I love him indicted to see I'm not back in a backing off of him and that regard at all but you know if you somebody that you're considering picking up considering streaming you know if Shane sharp is out for a few games then yeah maybe but when this rotation is at full strength I'm still avoiding him  Guilford says Julius Randle was terrible to begin the season that is very true is his production sustainable  you know good question Randall's played so much better  over the last month or so you know early on it was it was disastrous right I mean five of 22 on opening night yeah that's just kind of said hey on a bad course first 10 games of the year he was shooting 33% from the field 25% from three seventy percent at the line that brought us through November 13th 16 games since Julius Randle is at 25 points nine rebounds five and a half assists he's not giving anything defensively but it's Julius Randle so what do you expect  54% from the field 78% of the line 35 percent from three  so the question is is it sustainable  you know is Randall's shooting almost 55% sustainable know but the rest of it probably you know it's not like he hasn't put up similar numbers to this in the past right I mean last season he was a little bit down but he's kind of gone every other year with like Boomer bus Seasons since arriving in New York two seasons ago he was at 25 104 on 46% shooting 76% at the line not too far off what he's doing right now so I think the efficiency it's gonna Wax and Wane you know over the course of the Season he probably settles in if you can even shoot like 48% from the field that's fantastic for Julius Randle a guy who takes a lot of tough looks so in general yeah you know I think it's like you know 85 90% sustainable if you just watched the next night tonight like I watched their full game against Utah  late last week had some gambling interest on that one I mean Randall he's a ball hog absolutely he's not somebody that I would want to play basketball with but it's perfect for Fantasy I mean he just talked to the ball he's not giving it up right and I think that works to his Advantage obviously it's working well enough for the Nicks they're still hanging around in the East they're at the five seed they're 15 and 11 so yeah I think it's relatively sustainable well Wendell Carter Junior get back to his averages last year when he's ramped back up  I don't know if you will man I you know I grabbed him in a couple of a stash he should be making his return to night against Miami he's not on the injury report so barring some sort of setback you know him like banging up that finger during warm-ups he should play  you know the thing is Orlando's big totally fine without him right there's 16 and 9 and Wendell Carter has played five games for them and he was terrible and those five games 9 points 37% from the field very small sample I wouldn't read too much into that but I you know I think Orlando was going to be conscious of not messing up with good thing I mean they're off to basically a best case star didn't you know it's been Todd Zay and you know Moe Wagner getting minutes I'm not saying you know they're just gonna keep Wendell Carter out of the rotation like he's going to see minutes but I don't know if they just throw them out there for 30 minutes every night right I think maybe maybe he works his way up to that but is he gonna end up giving you what he gave you last season which was 15 points nine rebounds two and a half assists one and a half threes I'd be surprised I really would I think he's worth an ad you know specially if you're in a deeper format if you if you have a streamer spot and you know you sent her eligible right so that's that's the other thing too especially if you're in a two Center League you might need that spot so he's worth the flyer but I again I'd be surprised if he's back to where he was last season what do you think about Tyler Heroes return what is the ceiling in a 12-team points League  yeah I mean hero look great the other night right I mean kind of a best case scenario I think for a guy who had missed a pretty significant chunk of time and that was a tough tough matchup against the best defense in the league in Minnesota and here comes back you plays a full workload 33 minutes he's in the starting lineup 10 of 18 from the field did go just one of six from three but still gave you 25 with three rebounds two assists two steals  you know ceiling wise I think he could be a top 50 guy right you know if you just look at you know if you could do what he did the other night and keep that sustainable you know he'll break much higher than the top 50 now you know percentage is that's gonna be  kind of the the question with Tyler and he's not gonna shoot 50 plus percent from the field going forward but in his nine games this season he ranks as the 36 best fantasy player in eighth category leaks and that's what him shooting about 45% from the field and giving you know 235 and 4 are his averages on the year so stealing wise cat Tyler hero be a top 40 player yes I think he can you know Miami has a lot of mouths to feed and I think it was a coaching that hero and at a bio were back in the lineup we still saw Cody Martin start he still played 20 plus minutes Duncan Robinson still played 20 plus minutes still hit four threes Jaime has played 30 minutes Josh Richardson played 26 so there wasn't really it wasn't really like an obvious player who took a huge hit I guess would be Cody Martin the most out of that group in Miami didn't have Kyle Lowry so we do need to keep that in mind you know when he's back we'll see you know how much he cuts into to some of those workloads but I think it was encouraging you know specially if you're a Haka is fantasy manager that he still played 30 minutes and give you a pretty nice night with two blocks and two steals  pardon me dealing with a little bit of a cold  pool or Murphy  is the question from former Mets shortstop Jose Reyes  very good question I lean Tre Murphy I think he's the better player obviously Jordan pools in a vastly better fantasy situation are they pools gonna give you more headaches I think he has more upside night tonight you know he's been on a nice run  over the last three games we've also seen him go you know up and down up and down night tonight week to week so I would rather have Trey Murphy and you know you never which injury upon anybody but if you're holding Trey Murphy  to be frank you're hoping Zion Williams goes down at some point because that's gonna open things up for Trey Murphy  I'm thinking about flipping Kobe white and Camp Thomas for Pascal siakam is that too much he needs power forward and send her eligibility my lineup is guard heavy and Tyler hero just came back from the grave so you already got heavy and you got to Tyler hero back you know I mean Kobe white is basically been as good of not a better fantasy player than siakam so  I think this might be too much you know but if you're getting Camp Thomas on top of it then yeah it's probably fair I think that's fair especially when you when you factor in that you need somebody who's power forward Center eligible like siakam so in that scenario where you need something specific you got to be willing to take probably a slight discount just to fit the positional needs yeah I think that's fair I mean Kobe white force yaakov is a debate and if you're getting cam on top of that I think that's fair so I would probably do that deal  would you trade Lori Market in in D'Angelo Russell for CP3 and so bonus  hmm good question I mean Angel Russell's off to a pretty good start fantasy wise you know the field goal percentage just starting to come down as you'd expect he's still to me just not a good real life player I don't think he's a winning player and I do think there's a pretty good chance that he's moved ultimately I prefer to bonus to Market in those guys are very comparable in terms of fantasy you know if you're in a category League it kind of depends what you need you know you're getting you're getting better rebounding more consistent rebounding you're getting assists of course with simonis I mean marketing gives you almost nothing as a passer but he gives you the threes and you got you know more points so you know marketing versus the bonus to me is kind of a wash although I think so bonus it's going to be more sustainable you know there's already been some market and trade talks obviously Utah feels like a tanky team you worry about you know shut down for marketing late in the season so  you know I still prefer geelo to CP3 but I think that Gap is going to narrow as the season goes along so overall I would do the steel I would rather have some bonus than marketing and you know the DLow CP3 part is secondary to me  Jorge ask who do you think would be the next big hit on the waiver wire for category league for points  well I mean it's tough to say right not knowing the size of your league and who's available I'll take a look at you know who's out there and some of my League's right now  you know pajewski I think was kind of that guy obviously people went out got Dante exam this past week as well there's not I don't know if there's like a really obvious like oh this guy's just gonna average 20 points a game the rest of the way type of player you know in one shallow League that I'm in like Keegan Murray is out there now this is like a 10 Team league so you got to be aware of that you know we talked about Jalen Johnson getting dropped in some leaks earlier today I think if that happened in your league go get him other than that I don't know if there's really you know somebody who's gonna give you a ton of points and you can Target like a Malachi Brandon and sit in San Antonio and maybe hope that his role increases you know Malik Beasley is still out there and a lot of leagues and the keys only rostered in on ESPN League he's rostered in only 11% you know he's very 3-point dependent not a ton of upside there but if you need the reason points you know manual quickly a lot of people have cut bait with him he's not had a great start to the year but obviously we know what he's capable of so those are the names that come to mind if you if you're in a shallower league  would you trade John Collins for OG in nine category League  I would I think I would do this at first glance you know excuse me OG and nobody's Benny better fantasy player so far this season and  it's like he's not played well I mean this is bad  easily his worst start to a year over the last couple of Seasons now he's had health issues you may be worried about that cropping up at some point but to me I still think he's the better player he's been the more reliable player he has more upside and Utah has already talking about trading John Collins you know there's a report earlier this week that he could be on the Block I actually like this landing spot for Collins I just wanted to get out of Atlanta go somewhere we could play more minutes but you know feels like they've maybe already soured on that fit and they have some younger players they might want to get in there so I would you know John Collins is not really playing all that well anyway so I think you're kind of like selling media on him and you're buying low on ogn Adobe and I think I mean think about it like early in the season you know weekend if somebody had said you could get OG and Nobby for John Collins you would have you been thrilled right and I think so still got to see it through and hope that and Adobe emerges from that so I would lean OG in and Nobby and take that deal if that's on the table for you all right let's see so we got a kind of roster advice question  from a Dio says he's currently in fifth the last place team offered him Jordan Poole for cam Thomas yay or nay ah that is that is an interesting one I I would rather have Thomas I think I would you know I think with Jordan Poole what you're chasing is points in your chasing threes right you know the free throws have not really been there we thought he was somebody that could take like you know eight or nine free throws a game he's always been a high free throw guy in Golden state that hasn't really carried over I mean Camp Thomas has been better and more consistent and basically every category that we care about with both of these guys so yeah I would I would hold campus I would not I would not do that deal I think pool is going to continue to frustrate you there's gonna be ups and downs but I would prefer campus again you know very similar players in terms of their staff profile but Thomas to me has been vastly vastly better you know but then John Paul has this season so hold Camp Thomas if you're if you're sitting in fifth I would not be don't be helping out the last place team  all right let's see oh Guilford said pool is so trash LOL  yes that is correct I have to agree on that all right what else do we have here we talked about the waiver wire yeah keep those questions coming guys and I'll try to hit a few more and then you know we're already at the 45-minute Mark so probably head out here if we don't get anything coming in you know looking at the board tonight got a big night as is usually the case on Wednesdays 10 games on the Slate you know Boston playing on the second night of a back-to-back at Sacramento they're actually underdogs for the first time I'll season so that should be a fun game to monitor I really like Donovan Mitchell tonight if you're playing a DFS or you're doing things on the betting side you can get his you know points rebounds assists I think it's like 44 and a half  he's gonna go on like a Luca type of run here I think with no Garland and nobley a specialty against a bad Utah team at home tonight so I really like Donovan Mitchell  got a question from Eric  he said thinking Jonathan Isaac for steals blocks in a 14 Team league got any suggestions for a stream who would be better than Isaac if he plays in the back-to-back he might be the best option  it's hard to get excited about this version of Jonathan Isaac I mean it's just it's a shame man I mean he was what the six overall pick I think back in 2017 you know what went healthy early in his career was awesome he had that two and a half block one and one and a half steel season before the injuries really set in in 2019 and it's just it started to look like he's just never gonna get back to being that guy if you're chasing blocks and steals you know I mean he's not even giving me that many of them like early in the season you get a really nice run where he was giving you basically one one and a half of each per game you know we'll see if he plays both halves of the back to back he's done it he's done it a couple times to season so I think it's as long as he doesn't you know suffer some sort of injury or tweak that ankle that kept him out for a little bit early in the month then you should play both halves you know in a 14 Team league obviously your options are pretty limited I always say I mean Batiste Cycles the guy that I would pick up in in Daily lineups right I got a look at their schedule  the rest of the week but I think Batista Bible offers you exactly what you're looking for in terms of blocks and steals I think he's going to be more consistent he's gonna play significantly more minutes whether he's starting or coming off the bench and you know Portland plays tomorrow and then they play Saturday so two games remaining for the rest of the week and you know looking at Isaac and the magic like you said they have a back-to-back coming up and then they play Saturday so three games of Isaac versus two of the Bible as by voice just like completely goes out here sorry guys  it's a debate I you know Bible's probably available in your league I would just go I would just go grab him  a decent notes that Donovan Mitchell was not seen at shoot around this morning that is a good point by you I had not checked him oh he's dealing with an illness oh boy all right well I was on the radio last night trumpeting Donovan Mitchell props so hopefully he plays that is not not great news let's listen to this questionable right now and we'll see if he's able to get back  a question about Dante Exum is he still serviceable for the long term  short term yes long term I have my question you know I think what's Kyrie's back and what's Josh Green is back  you know Exodus played so well over the last couple of weeks that I do think they keep him in the rotation but is he playing more than 18 to 22 minutes probably not it was giving you some assists he's giving you some threes but really you're chasing the points with exam so is he worth an ad right now not knowing how long I reach out yes long term is he really sustainable I would if it's a yes or no question I would probably say no thoughts Atari Eason love tari Eason man loved him coming out of the draft love to Matt LSU he's not in a great situation but he's played so well that he's forced his way into the mix for Houston right I mean the Rockets have so many guys on the wing and you know Jay Sean Tate has been absent lately I'm at Thompson obviously has missed a lot of time so I think that's helped our Eason but he's played so well over the last few games that you know I think he's forced his way into that rotation and he was coming off the bench even when he's not playing that many minutes he still rebounding at a crazy high rate you know he's giving you a bunch of steals give me some blocks last five games for Easton 16 points 10 rebounds 2.2 steals 53% from the field in 28 minutes so loved our Eason special if you're in like a 14 or 16 Team league he absolutely has to be roster could probably starting him in those leaks and if you could Summit you know if you can hold him in 12 week I would do it I would do it I think you get you got to be realistic about what the upside is here you know the Rockets have a lot of miles to feed you know Jalen green Fred Van Vleet goon their first rounder  Javier Smith last year like Charlie Houston still ranks relatively low in the pecking order but he's one of those guys that doesn't need to be you know your number two number three number four option even like you just finds ways to impact the game so definitely hold him um yeah dtop passing along Mitchell is officially questionable good call there we got that up at RotoWire but thanks for the reminder  Timothy asked as a sar a drop in a 12 team League yeah we touched on him earlier I I think he asked to be man especially if you're in a weekly lineup league and you know you got to throw them out there and just kind of you know play the whims of money Williams it's really hard to trust and even with some guys you know out of the lineup in that front Court the last few games the minutes have not been there  Detroit just gets blown out like it what 8 out of 10 games they're losing by like 20 plus and you know top since young enough that you think that would really affect him but they're emptying out the bench you know for a lot of fourth quarters and you know early in the season when he had that great run I mean he was playing you know mid-30s at least even high 30s in terms of minutes on a lot of nights so if he's only playing 22 minutes a game he's just not gonna give you the numbers so yeah unfortunately then I I think I would drop a sar top said somebody that's always gonna be in the back of your mind of like man I we've seen the upside it's like you should be in a good fantasy situation I would drop him now and if they trade but we got ball game of which at some point I think maybe that's what would reopens the window for us our tops and later in the season DTM mentions that are Easton got more minutes than the starters in the Rockets last game that is true man it is and you know Jabari Smith is somebody only played 23 minutes he did a four fouls so that was part of it against Cleveland and that overtime loss on Monday  but you know Jamari Smith is also a guy attention to float around right and if he's not giving you a whole lot on any given night you can see email udoka pretty easily pivoting Tatar Eason and I don't think we see Taurus in you know take over the starting job for Brooke surge of Artie Smith I'd be pretty surprised to give in the level of investment that they have a Jabari and he's played pretty well on balance you have to really disappointing rookie season yeah actually like what I've seen from him for the most part so it's not like he's playing his way out of the starting lineup but if our Easter could basically just be your sixth man that's fine you know that's totally fine and you know Jason Tate played on Monday played about 16 minutes Yep they're still handing Jeff Green a ton of minutes he played 24 he's played well six of six from the field so you know it's not like they need to kick him out of the rotation but you'd love to see some of those minutes more consistently go to tari Eason  all right George says thoughts on Kelvin Johnson can he sustain his numbers the rest of the season  most likely yeah I mean the Spurs are kind of like the the Pistons in some ways and the Wizards and the Blazers and these other teams that are out the bottom where you know they're they have their guys for the most part you know webinars missed what two games I think last night was the second absence of the year and they're still losing basically every night so I don't I don't see any reason to to back away from that it's not like Kelvin Johnson is winning you games he's been on a really nice run for the last month last 15 games 19.7 rebounds four assists that's nice you know he's not a guy that was really doing a whole lot of that in years past he was at you know 2.9 2.1 assist each of the last two seasons in the minutes are about where they were during those last two years you know the steals have come in bunches for him he's not very consistent in terms of racking up defensive stats but it was had a couple games with multiple steals a couple four Steel games in the last two weeks he's taking a ton of shots you get to the line at a decent rate he started to shoot the three better as well so yeah I mean San Antonio again like Detroit those are both two teams that you don't necessarily trust but I mean Kelvin Johnson is now played at least 31 minutes in 18 consecutive games so if we  if we can't trust that sample I don't know what we can't trust so yeah I think his numbers are pretty sustainable thoughts on Marcus Smart's return yeah Marcus Smart we got some indications earlier this week that he could be back as soon as tomorrow they said he may return tomorrow night Grizzlies are at home for the Pacers after that they're on the road at Atlanta I think like worst case scenario we see Marcus Smart back for the start of next week and he has not played since November 14th so pretty long lay off as a little bit shaky early in the season but was giving you two steals a game five assists that was without java Ranch of course so we got to see what that looks like but yeah I've been holding him and I are in a couple weeks I'm not dropping him you know unique situation and that he played Without Miranda's back so very possible that he loses a little bit of upside in terms of scoring and assists but always the guy who you know plays a ton of games usually finds a way to finish inside the top 100 so I would I would hold him for the time being and just gonna see what it looks like over the next couple of weeks  Novell says is keyonte George nearing a return yeah good question they're taking a game to game with jonte George he's missed now three in a row was ruled out for tonight's game that'll be number four you know usually you get the returns to practice notes you know some sort of indication that he's moving in the right direction we have not really I've not really had that yet the Jazz did confirm about a week ago that he avoided a serious injury to that foot and ankle area got an MRI and there's no damage there Cleveland's on the front end of a back-to-back tonight almost never do you see a player sit the front end and then come back on the back end on the road so I think he'll remain out tonight he'll probably remain out tomorrow you know maybe Saturday at Toronto but you know Jazz around a road trip right now they could continue at San Antonio on Tuesday at New Orleans on Thursday giving where they're at you know they're not really rushing him back I wouldn't be surprised if you know maybe he doesn't play again until they're at home at the end of next week so I might have to wait it out it's going to be a waiting game with key update George and it's a shame too because he had the best game of his career before he got hurt 30.7 assists against the Oklahoma City Thunder on December 11th I'm still a little tepid on him overall in category leaks in points totally fine he's giving you points he's giving you assist you know steals are on and off but he shooting 36% from the field and I don't know if that number dramatically improves as we as we move along all right we'll do a couple more and then we'll get out of here thanks guys for the questions didn't really know how this would go go and solo didn't know didn't think we would get to an hour but we're almost there all right don't force says is a men's Thompson going to be a core part of the Rockets rotation is he worth the pickup I would say probably not worth a pickup I mean he certainly a core part of this team going forward you kind of forget now because he's missed so much time I mean it's just top five pick right somebody that we were really excited about we he's supposed to be the better Prospect compared to a sar Thompson and you know unfortunately injuries have just kind of eaten up his entire first third of the Season he's only played in five games so far it came back played ten minutes last week against San Antonio immediately got hurt again I think I think used to playing really well right now by their standards you know they're hanging around in the playoff playing mix they're one of the best defenses in the league they have battles to feed they have managed that need to be told out and I think the fact that Tara Easton has started to come on makes us an even bigger uphill climb for a mental tops and so he'll have his moments no question I'm still pretty high on him long term but he'll probably need an injury I think to play enough minutes to be fantasy relevant I think we might look back on this season and say all right it was kind of a developmental year and then maybe next year's when we really see the full breakout for him what are your thoughts on Levert and healed rest of season 9 cat yeah LaVergne have a pretty nice opportunity here with no Garland right I mean he'll be the pretty clear number two option I know they're still bringing them off the bench right now that seems to be the preferred role you're gonna have to live with the variance for Levert you know buddy hield to somebody I want a roster as much as I can got off to a bit of a slow start but he's yeah kind of back to being every other game it feels like but on balance I mean buddy hield is still a really really good fantasy player you know the volume from three that's where you're concerned about I mean he's losing about six minutes per game compared to last year he's at 2.7 made threes per game was up over three last season but he almost never missed his time you know he's played more games and anybody in the NBA by a mile like 25 more than anybody else you know since he entered the NBA so even if you you know even if there's like a slight downturn in the per game stats like he's somebody who plays almost 80 games every year and I think he can make up for it right now he writes 21st  and total made threes he's been a guy who almost always finishes in the top five top three in that category so that's a little bit concerning but if I'm using between the two I think I just want the pain to be a buddy he'll specially in a category League All right a couple more here and then we'll head out should I trade marketing chat in Wagner for Bank Cairo and Tato I don't think I would do it especially if that's frauds Wagner no way no way I mean jet holder in some format to spend the best fantasy player of that group I understand there's some injury concern there but there's some shutdown maybe some injury concerned with marketing I always love getting Jayson Tatum because he's just so dependable and you know as far as Superstars go it doesn't miss a lot of time and obviously make carrots having a nice year but I would I would not do this three for two I would I would hang on to the market in chat and Wagner side of this again it's that is frauds or not mow  monk or Pat Williams gotta drop one for a streaming spot good question here from Dennis you know my first inclination would be to drop Patrick Williams he he is probable for tonight for what it's worth was dealing with the calf injury looks like he will play excuse me you know he's come on of late I was last year or two years ago I remember him comparing himself to Kauai I don't know if we're ever gonna get that version of him but last 13 games he's at about 14 points five rebounds per game good percentages he always giving you about two threes per game as well I think I still lean Malik monk though you know monk has been the more consistent scorer he's giving you a lot of assists too that's been the nice nice trend for him this season 5.2 assists per game you know not somebody that you ever really think about is a great passer he's averaging 3.23 per game over his last 12 I would go Malik monk I think you the kings are just an ideal fantasy team as well they play fast they put up a lot of points sometimes they allow a lot of points Chicago's dead last in the NBA and pace and I know this they still found ways for guys like food and Kobe white and DeRozan to have fine Seasons but it's just not a team that that really plays to the advantage for fantasies so I would drop that Williams and go with Malik Monk all right appreciate the merry Christmas happy holidays wishes guys George says thanks Nick Merry Christmas to you and your family same to you man DTS same thing
