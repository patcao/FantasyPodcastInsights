welcome into a Wednesday morning LIVE edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Nick Whalen back with Brandon Kravitz Brandon we got a lot to get to today as usual at some point this will devolve into a live listener Q&A that's kind of become the meat potatoes of the Pod if you will Brandon and we enjoy all the the live questions we'll get to those you know over the second half of the podcast so feel free to throw those in the chat we'll hit those will include all the time stamps you know on YouTube and in the description so you can skip around and you know kind of get advice on whatever players or teams you need but Brandon we had a season tournament nights on Tuesday I want to get kind of an overall check in now as we have reached the end of group play you know we have the the real thing coming out of next week the semi-finals the finals in Vegas a lot of still up in the air as far as like what the rest of the schedule is going to look like from like from a fantasy basketball perspective it's super confusing to go over to like the NBA.com or espn.com schedule page and it's just like blocks and blocks of TBD but you know overall given what you thought the tournament would be when it was announced back in what July or August versus what it's been now at the end of November as I've been a success as I've been a failure has it been somewhere in the middle like where do you come in  I think it's been a huge success well we didn't expect anything too much from it it really was gonna come down to are the fans into it and entertained check on that are the games good that was right out of the gate they were good and then this shouldn't be the most important part because you shouldn't have to convince millionaires that play basketball for a living to care about the games they play but through the players care do they care about the tournament itself and I think a lot of them especially the the higher end Stars acted like you know I don't even know what this is I'm confused by it whatever uh but as the tournament tournament has gone along as Group Play went along we saw those guys now all the sudden they ratchet up their intensity I thought last night was such a win for the NBA where you had the Celtics running up the score on the Bulls and Joe missoul has to go over to Billy Donovan and explain what he's doing that's something we're gonna look back there might be a 3430 about this one day and that clip is going to be in it this is so in that way it was a win did the Celtics go too far on that because you know Billy Donovan he kind of clarified after I think he understood you know it's not like he didn't know that it comes down to point to French so I think he he got what the Celtics were doing but he said you know it look it was a step too far you're up 30 you're you're specifically embarrassing Andre Drummond he's like it's one thing if you want to leave your starters in and try to score as much as you can get some stops but to go to hack a drum into that situation he felt like was a bridge too far I mean do you agree with that or is it do whatever you got to do to get that differential  if you're going after differential you get to do it you got to do I completely agree to points pile up in the NBA you can never if that's what you're going after then then that's what you have to do I do think that as we get through one season of this and I will disclaimer this this is coming from a bitter magic supporter who was screwed by differential I don't think that games or advancing in this tournament should be decided by Point differential we have to come up with a different way for exactly that reason I don't think that the games should devolve into I'm trying to beat you by 30 I think that that is it's not so much that the team like the magic have been playing phenomenal get left out of advancing in this tournament it's more of the issue of what we saw last night in that game where we're teams are gunning for certain number that's fun and an All-Star game in the regular season I think it bastardized is the sport a little bit  yesterday wow good work  do you think you know do we get like a college football playoff situation here where you know five years from now or even two or three years from now this is expanded you know because of what you just said that you know the type Breakers and whatnot are a little convoluted and it doesn't quite seem fair when you're dealing with such a small sample size right a four game sample inevitably you're going to have ties all over the place and I think that's maybe something that the NBA would want to address to have a cleaner way to decide other than Point differential I don't know what that solution would be off the top my head but you know I was the expanding the field would would get more teams into this like two three years now you think we have 12 finalists and six um I think I'm gonna hold out on definitively answering that question until we see how this next round goes I don't think that we can look at restructuring the overall format of it until we get an idea of what it looks like when it's completely played out if you take it too far does it then eat into too much of the regular season we're not even sure conclusively that this is a positive I don't think we need more of it yet I think let's just settle in on what we have in front of us but one thing if you wanted to stick with Point differential because throughout all of this they've been trying to follow this international soccer model of group play We're Point differential does come into play when you're talking about group staging before you would knock out round if you want to do that in the NBA okay but at least just limited to point differential against common opponents so I mean I'm only gonna use this example because it's one that I followed the most clothes are most closely but would be the the Celtics and Nets and Magic matchups against each other should be the only thing that determines who had advances to the next round what the Celtics do against the Bulls should be completely irrelevant to the situation with the bulls do against the Raptors should be irrelevant so how much did the magic beat the Celtics by how much did the Celtics beat the Nets by I think that you if you're going to use Point differential it should be within a common opponent tiebreaker situation not against everybody because yeah okay so you beat the Bulls by 30 what is that right what does that mean yeah I saw I saw some complaining specifically from some wolves fans on Twitter last night you know they're they're obviously the best team in the western conference right now they did not qualify for the in season tournament and their argument was like look we got we got Golden State we got okay see we got Sacramento in our group like yeah you got the Spurs you could beat up on them but you know the Lakers for example just lost my elbows 40 to the Sixers the other night they went four know and their group partially because they got Utah Portland and Memphis you know so yeah it's kind of the luck of the draw so if you're blow up your blowout happens to come and in season tournament play the near screwed that I just don't I don't like the way that it's set up in that regard but I do think I don't want Point differential to be involved in it at all I I don't really think that that's the best determining factor for who advances in this thing but whatever it's what we have right now and until we come up with something better or maybe play a fifth game where you know it's not I don't know if that would make a huge difference either at the end they can still end up with is but yeah I think you need a fairly you know dramatic jump in Sample to avoid that last thing I'll say on the it sees a tournament you know they they did kind of the March Madness style if you were watching the TNT broadcast specifically last night of bucks heat you know where you had all the like the score graphics on the top which was actually pretty confusing because they had like five different scores it was all over the place I think what they need is you know a live updating kind of like a table of standings as a supposed to the game scores because you basically need to have a second screen of referencing like okay what is each team's record here what what's on the line like there should be a little graphic you know kind of with that like updates live especially last night when it was basically all about Point differential you know like I think that would be more useful than just playing the raw scores like I think he kind of a little table for each group and you know I've seen it could if you're watching a game is there a bunch of games that started at like you know 7pm my time last night they're like five or six games going on at once I mean you could have a live updating table and teams are kind of moving up and down within their group based on what happened so I think overall you're right this is better success like I I thought players would care way less about it and you know Jimmy Butler sat out last night probably could have played that maybe says something about how some players feel about it but in general I think there are a few pretty minor tweaks the league could make to to just clarify you know some of the the logistical things regarding the season tournament and that would go a long way toward kind of roping into casual fans I completely agree I look at this through two different lenses one as a magic fan and somebody who works with the team from that lens I thought it was really easy to follow so from if you're just following one team and one group it's not that complicated but the second lens I look at it through is as an NBA fan I love the league and that was hard to follow it was hard to keep track of everything that was going on and so to your point if they're gonna do this and they're going to roll this out to their fans they've got to do a better job explaining it's not like this like I hate saying that because I feel like sometimes it comes across like oh I'm just so confused by how this all works it's not that confusing it's that it's there's so much to keep track of with it and it's new they should be beating us over the head with how this works how teams and what matters I think they could have done a better job yeah I'm more information on videos I guess Voice by Richard Jefferson that might be the solution all right before we talk about the ball we got a message from Underdog fantasy it's

of DFS sites out there but I think presentation wise app wyze Underdog is one of my favorite let's talk some lamelo I mean this is just brutal news for my nfkc team which you know I don't like to go out early in the season but I was a good shape your brain and this is the best team I think I've had in this contest and I've been doing it for five or six years now I mean I was signing up for when I started Anthony Davis in LaBella ball with my first two picks I remember you mentioning that like you know how this was gonna end the way the board broke down it kind of had no choice I either had to play it I would have kind of taken some like safe choices that I didn't have enough upside like that League I'm trying to win it or like take last I don't really care you know it's not one it's not like the road to wire snake League where you just got to be in the top half of the standings like I want to win this thing so I figured you know why not throw caution to the wind here lamelo with Davis if anything I thought add would be the guy that we'd be dealing with an injury you know less than 20 games in but let mellow will miss quote extended time no structural damage technically to his right ankle and foot which is I guess a good thing but they're calling a severe ankle sprain we don't really have a firm time table I mean I'm racing for I think I probably could be a month plus right is considering he injured that same area of his body multiple times last season yeah I was actually at that game where he went down in a heap he was down for a while you aren't sure just based on the way that he fell if it was leg or if he had hit his head on the court and then when you saw him getting helped off to the locker room he couldn't put any weight whatsoever on his ankle and that was the issue that he dealt with last year so this is now becoming a Serial event with lamelo ball and I think is problematic for his future these ball children just simply cannot catch a break Lonzo has been dealing with injuries all the way throughout his career and seems like lamelo I don't know if it's you know hereditary if it's coincidence or the way that they were brought up I'm not gonna speculate on that because the shoes for Lotso that's why my personal Theory but you know I believe it's been a puma guy the last couple of years right well this is not a good advertisement for Puma then I didn't even know Puma was still making basketball shoes so this is news to  me but not good this I mean I don't know how long he's gonna be out but hard to have any confidence that he's not just gonna go back out on the on the injury report again in the future yeah I mean last nine games for the Mellow we got off of that terrible start shooting the ball but then I mean he was one of the best players in all the fantasy for the last few weeks 32 points seven rebounds almost nine assists one and a half steals 49 44 88 shooting splits over the last couple of weeks before that injury so obviously devastating for me devastating for anybody rostering lamelo yeah I would like to say we got a representative sample last night of like all right what is this rotation look like postal mellow and maybe we did I mean that the Hornets got completely blown off the floor by the New York Knicks which might be happening quite a bit so maybe this is what the rotation will actually look like you know I thought you know Gordon Hayward I threw him out there and one of my lineups thinking all right No Limit Oh you know maybe some more play baking for him some more opportunities you did have six assists he played 28 minutes but just took just seven shots that was pretty disappointing last night although it's a good Nick's defense you know miles Bridges even struggled he's been fantastic lately I do think you know if one player benefits above all it's probably Terry Rozier who did not have a good shooting night last night but but I think his users will go up and you know Brandon Miller is actually looked pretty decent as well I mean he led them with 18 points in 36 minutes last night yeah I think the most direct bump up would be Terry Rozier because he'll take over as a starting point guard so like you said all the usage he'll end up piling up numbers in that way and he's a decent Defender but Brandon Miller I think Brandon Miller looks the part he looks more and more comfortable every time I watch him and I think overall he's gonna end up as the biggest beneficiary if this injury is  really long term we're talking about a couple of months you know in the in the immediate it's Terry Rozier but over the course of the season if lamelo ball misses extended truly extended time right in a Miller could end up becoming the star of this team and you know if he does pop off and that way I don't I'm not saying he's gonna win rookie of the year because he's got some pretty stiff competition right now but I think that he's a guy that if he plays well enough they could end up changing the  sort of the the direction of who really who exactly where we building this team around you know he's got that sort of potential I love the way he plays yeah he's look good man I actually thought he would struggle more than he has obviously didn't look good in summer league but we've seen seen plenty of players you know play horribly in summer league and get it figured out I don't think that's really much of a Harbinger but 150 to 1 right now to win rookie of the year I mean obviously I think he would need an injury to probably both of Victor webmin Jama and chat homerun who are naked naked at this point Brandon Yama I just won 25 chat homegrown is closed that Gap he's at minus 110 you got to start tops in 80 to 1 Miller 15 or 150 to 1 and then you know scoot Henderson Jaime hockey as Jordan Hawkins right now as the seventh lowest odds so it's a two-man race I wouldn't really recommending any of those long shots right now a dollar a dollar on Brandon Miller won't kill you look it I wouldn't be shocked if women Yama or home could get hurt at some point so yeah maybe yeah maybe five bucks why not you know if you're gonna do it make some money on this all right I want to talk about some players to consider dropping rode a piece on RotoWire that also ran on Yahoo this week but before we get to that David seats the NBA season is underway on

seeing Kyle kuzma introduced before a Bucks game at 5:40 I mean just yeah my point is use Vivid Seats all right Brad and I mentioned you know I wrote that piece we we do this each week for free Yahoo and we run it on RotoWire just kind of breaking down players to consider dropping and the caveat here is you know I'm not writing up somebody who's like 5% owned or even 20% owned right it's it's guys who are you know tough decisions essentially it's like all right I'll put it on the line Nick Wright I want to add Jaime Hawkins I want to add Isaiah Joe I want to add Dario sorry but maybe I'm in a 10 or 12 Team league who's a player that I might not feel great about dropping but you can make a case to do it anyway I'll run through my list and we could talk about a few of these guys I think they'll be relevant to to a lot of people listening and you know maybe even some of the questions we get in the chat  I want to start with Gary Trent and this is  this is like years three of me going through this with Gary Trent like I and of course I dropped him in two League's after I probably should have done so like two weeks ago and then he you know had one of his better games to the season last night for Toronto I just I can't do it anymore with Gary Trent man like the steals our starting to dry up you know he was a guy who was like pretty consistently stealing a half if not more per game like he's under a steal per game now this season the field goal percentage is a huge killer in Roto League's like he'll give you give me some volumes scoring but you also is you know prone to shooting 30% over a two weeks band and you know weirdly enough for him like he's obviously very three-point Reliant and that's gonna drag down the field goal percentage but he's under 60% at the free throw line as well this season like that that's been just a dramatic fall off for guys been a pretty decent free throw shooter he's a he's a guy that I thought would be a hot trade candidate but he isn't really been playing himself into that discussion and it was a guy that was brought up a lot last year as well I just noticed that this has been the case there seems to be something in the water in Toronto you know we were down on Pascal siakam at first to start the year was all about Scotty Barnes now Scotty Barnes he's bad but he's not what he was to start the season and and we haven't seen Gary Trent Jr really go off at any point I you know you look up and down the game log is he just doesn't have a string of success yet this season and so yeah if you need to make room on your roster I'm with you it was one of my takeaways and I read this article he did a great job with it I agree with almost 100% of of your article so I was like where can I push back on Nick a little bit I don't have a lot I thought you brought up some really good points it was tough to write baby because I you know I tend to be very cautiously if I'm like giving advice to other people you know where it's just like I don't want to you don't screw people over yeah your fear is like yeah drop Andrew Wiggins then you know reels off like 325 point games in a row but I think I did my best to make a strong case and you know Gary Trent last year like I had a bunch of teams and it actually went pretty well like he had you know 25 game Span in the middle of last season where he averaged 21 points per game on 45 39 90 from the field so like there there's proven history of Gary trying having those runs and he'll probably have them again at some point this season but it's just it feels percentage just been a problem for me and a few leaks and like having him just you know it's such a drain on that category specifically like even even nights where he gives you you know 1920 points it's a lot of like you know five before 14 shooting and things like that so Gary Trent made the list pretty easily you know Wiggins I mentioned he as of yesterday when I wrote this up he's still 68% rostered in Yahoo League's and I get it but at the same time  you know there's just not a lot of positive indicators you know there's a story Kendra Andrews wrote for ESPN yesterday that noted that they people inside the organization and Golden State are quote annoyed at his lack of conditioning I don't know how that happens like Jake Andrew Wiggins has never been somebody we've had to question the conditioning but there's still that you know that weird absence last year that nobody really knows exactly what happened and if you read that piece it sounds like even the Warriors aren't really sure why he missed so much time and I don't know if we're gonna look back on that and say man like Andrew Wiggins was just never quite the same after whatever happened last year or yeah I mean it could be conditioning issue and and maybe that's on him maybe that's just something that's going to take time I'm assuming that you wrote this article prior to him scoring 29 Points getting 10 rebounds and shooting 61% from the field I think that is exactly right that is by fear in telling people to drop because then he goes 11 of 18 last night for 29 so yeah but I mean that's been that's been a huge outlier right I mean prior to last night I think he'd only scored 20 points twice on the year you go back to about 10 days ago 31 points against the Thunder that was in an overtime game so you played really well there but outside of that you  haven't really seen a lot I I'm not surprised to all to see the percentages of him being rostered because he he's still a big name people want pieces of the Golden State Warriors and he's one of the biggest stars that they have and so when you have the when you have the brand value you're always going to get a longer leash and it seems like that's what fantasy managers are giving danger Wiggins I'm not in a room I mean now it's easy for me to say this I didn't have to write an article and then he drops 29 but I'm not in a rush to drop him just because I just because you know what he can do yeah there's there's only one other guy on the list that I push back on  yeah well last thing I'll say about Wiggins is it's really just points and rebounds at this point so even even on the nights when you scoring like he's still he's still probably a better real life player than than a fantasy player it's kind of a two category guy we'll see if the shooting comes around I mean free throws if you're in a category League it's always been an issue with him but you know the free throw shooting has gotten even worse who else who else would you push back on from my list  and I understand you adding him to it but I still think better days are ahead for Ben mathura and I'm not willing to put him on the wire and have somebody else pick him up I mean you brought up the obvious points that if he's not scoring at a high clip what else is he really giving you but we saw it last year these completely capable of this and you're talking about an offense that is at the top of the league in scoring and a guy who has the ability to be a six-man of the Year candidate he did that in his first year in the NBA I think this is a sophomore slump right now that he could break out of at any point and I want to make sure that he's on my roster so even it's even though it's sort of ankle weight right now he's just not a guy that I'm willing to throw back out there yeah understandable for sure you know I think the biggest thing that stood out to me is the lack of minutes you know it's like I thought Ben mathura could take a pretty big leap this season and you know feels like you know Indiana scoring like 135 every single night and for whatever reason he's just not a big part of it you know compared to last year like the average almost 29 minutes per game as a rookie and he's at like 24 minutes a game this season like I don't care how much of a microwave score you are like you're just gonna have a tough time being fantasy relevant if you're you're kind of only a Points Guy and you give a few rebounds here and there like that's about it with bathroom in the 3-point shooting was pretty bad last season and his remains hovering around 32% you know if you're only playing 24.6 minutes per game it's gonna be difficult and the other thing Brandon is free throw rate it's been cut in half I mean that was I think something that was really underrated and what are the reasons that I thought math learning could take a big leap this season is like you don't have you don't have a lot of rookie guards come in in average like six free throws per game that's very rare and he's down at 2.9  per game this season yeah I also consider that a guy that we've talked about a lot is being a trade candidate and Buddy hield maybe that opens up some more minutes for Ben mathurin and we don't know when something like that could happen we're already at the end of November trade deadlines in February that'll be here before we know it I just think better days are ahead but yeah you do have to be concerned when he I mean he can shoot at a low percentage on any given night and and he certainly not giving you a lot in terms of the defensive stats the side of the stocks so to speak but he's he's a tremendous challenge right now is going through a rough stretch I can just see it now three weeks from now we're talking about hot waiver adds to Target and it's hey look who's back Ben mathura yeah I mean based on how some of my legs are going to season maybe just you know read this article as like a waiver pickup instead of players to drop just go and pick up all these guys you might be better off Dice and Daniels with somebody that I mentioned he's down to 32% roster so he's a little bit below the threshold of some other players on the list obviously your rostering him for for the steals first and foremost the assistant the rebounds have been nice he has at least one steal in 15 of 18 games so far this season I I am very curious to see what their rotation looks like tonight New Orleans is in action their home for the 76ers because they're getting CJ McCollum back which is massive Trey Murphy is listed as doubtful tonight I highly doubt he'll play but I mean he could be back I think they play Friday against the Spurs so we might not get a full representative sample tonight but once both of those guys are back in the mix  I think dice in is still in the rotation I don't think he's approaching you know 28 32 minutes most nights so I would feel pretty comfortable you know if you roster for the last month you probably got the best stretch of the season for him yeah I think the the windows closed and and it will be interesting to see how many minutes do you give to CJ McCollum as far as tonight goes a guy that's coming back from a collapsed lung credit to him for making his way back as quick as he did with an injury like that missing 12 games is a lot but when you talk about a collapsed lung it feels like a drop in the bucket I by the way my best bet tonight and the line is already moved took the Sixers at minus one and a half loved every second of it I this is one of my one of my Staples when you and I started this podcast that ran down my list of things I look for when betting  when stars are reinserted into a lineup especially if that team's been playing well it tends to ruin chemistry and and people can't wait to bet the team that's getting the guy back but it doesn't always work like that it takes a minute and this is this group would actually been playing well together adding CJ McCollum back to the mix and we don't know that he's getting full minutes either against the 76ers team that covers the spread as well as anybody so if you're looking for a little action tonight maybe you can tell me on that yeah and if you want a full betting breakdown of every slate myself Alex barua we're on Sirius XM NBA Radio at 7 p.m. Eastern Monday through Friday breaking down every game given out our Best Bets one of mine last night Brandon was a nice little player prop parlay we had we had cat over nine and a half boards which hit no problem okay C is a terrible rebounding team all we needed was two three pointers out of DeAndre Hunter it went one for six one for six we got the attempt that you know info our heart was in the right place but yeah nevertheless check that show out on Sirius XM you can listen to it back on the SSM app as well all right let's hit the last read here that we'll get into some listener questions I also want to talk about you know some of the fantasy MVPs of the season and talk about a great page on Yahoo where you could look at which players are highest rostered on the teams that are doing the best this season but we got a message from rival fantasy LeBron versus Jordan Magic versus bird Berkeley versus Michael basketball is synonymous with Legendary player rivalries they make the game more fun and they give fans story lines that raise the stakes every time those players meet on the court or come up with conversation now every matchup and had to head debate can be settled on Rival fantasy this NBA season you can play challenges where you decide which NBA player will score more fantasy points in their next game you could play the Rival fantasy in house challenges or create your own and get a friend in the mix with customizable Social Challenges join rival.com Slash Road a wire that's where you can sign up and get a 200 dollar to positive match get in on this right now before we get too deep into the NBA season that's join rival.com slash wrote a wire it's time to step up to the challenge on Rival fantasy we will see you in the arena all right so I mentioned that that MVPs page over on Yahoo which is a tool that they have for for you know Fantasy Baseball fantasy football as well and you know it basically says all right the best team  I think they take you know like the the top 10 or 20% of the best performing teams and you can sort by by Roto or head to head to get a better gauge and they say all right you know what percentage rostered are certain players that are making these teams so good  unsurprisingly Brandon Tyrese Maxey is roster dog 28% of the top performing fantasy teams on Yahoo  not surprised by that at all just based on where he was drafted and he was he was pushed down because of the James Harden presence and he was a steal for those that invested in him as if he was going to be the number two to Joel embiid you didn't have to pay that price that's the reason why he ends up so high on a list like this because you got Maxi just think about who you were able to draft prior to even adding him to your rust or so that one makes a lot of sense  yeah that was not surprising at all I mean that's still a pretty stunning percentage 28% is extremely high after that Brooke Lopez 21.2% and Tobias Harris 20.8% very quietly have it a great Roto League season yeah that one surprised me um I don't know exactly where that one's coming from but the Brook Lopez a him being towards the top of this list I think tells an interesting story where if you're not getting yogic or indeed in terms of the center position then you're you're probably waiting you're better off waiting until very specific point in the draft to Target Center because you need to load up at these other positions and if you're able to get a value in terms of your big then you're going to have a leg up I think that's the reason why when you scroll down the list you don't have to go very far before you see guys like boots and Valentino and Mark Williams and and Brooke Lopez because of the Season he's having is at the top of that list he's inside the top 25 if you go by total value you know obviously somebody hasn't missed any time yet per game value is still inside the top 40 doing large parts of the blocks right I mean you see for a big man who plays a ton of minutes it's always a weird stat line like he doesn't rebound at nearly the rate that you would think he's only at about five boards per game doesn't really pass all that much 1.3 assists but just under a steel per game 2.8 blocks per game 50% from the field giving you almost two three-pointers as well so I had big concerns coming into the year about you know will Brook Lopez hold up for a second straight season like he had back surgery two years ago and I felt like last year was the best best case scenario like what do you play liked 75 77 games I thought they'd be a little more cautious with him but we also have seen I mean Milwaukee they absolutely need Brooke Lopez On The Floor defensively I mean if he misses any stretch of time this season that could be just asterisk for a defense that's already struggled yeah he's you know low-key one of their MVPs and I think Milwaukee has started to put it together but he's been the constant all along the way and amazing at his age that he's not dropping off he's like the Travis Kelce of the NBA at this point he just keeps getting better and better man I mean he had 39 the other night when I was in the house against Washington you know there's a few interesting names on this list like D'Angelo Russell is it ranks pretty high you know he's roster I'm 15% of the best Yahoo teams that was one that stood out to me too how what was it because he shoots a hyper Senate from three that's the only thing I could put together  yeah that one I mean I guess maybe he was going so late in drafts that you know if you got if you got them around pick 100 and he's been like a top 75 guy you know you're getting some pretty serious value there but I still feel like he's been that good Austin Reeves making the list too that that's pretty surprising I mean he's got it together some like the percentages are starting to come around but it doesn't feel like Austin Reeves is having the you know kind of post contract breakout that we thought  yeah a couple of the names that weren't towards the top of the list surprised me as much as anything I have to scroll down pretty far to find a start time Thompson who's been a revelation and in the category scoring format there was another name that jumped out to me as well I'm blanking on it right now oh Tyreese Halliburton only 12.4% I think the thing with Halbert is he was going so high that he's just kind of Performing as expected right I mean he saw he's not raising the level of your fantasy Squad he's just yeah  right I mean for the most part it's like these are guys that are well outperforming their ADP as to guys who are beating it but then you know yeah SGA it was 18% you know rostered on these successful team chat home grin 21% that makes sense as well  some of this stuff I think does tell a story and then with others like SGA being at 18% and Tyreese Halliburton being at 12 I think is more random than anything else yeah when you see Chad homegrown towards the top there's that that there's real value in substance and that Tyrese Maxey at number one Jalen Johnson who's not too far down the list Scotty Barnes those guys those seem to be the difference making players but some of these other guys that are at the top or like yokich being at 14% I mean that's certainly not hurting your your fantasy team  all right let's get into some live listener questions our guy freaky always a staple on the streams he asks guys I gotta drop two of these players I drafted on a three punch Jones Bruce Brown scoot Henderson or Klay Thompson  I gotta drop two  man I want to hold on to Henderson so bad well so it's also relevant here that if I'm reading this correctly is punting threes so I like obviously clay to be is kind of the outlier but if you're if you're pumping threes that becomes a little bit more palatable I would try to trade clay as opposed to dropping him though  yeah  I think I would I think I'd like go of if you get the punt threes maybe scoot Henderson you hang on to him  hang on to tyus Jones  stubbornly I guess Bruce Brown and Klay Thompson  it's crazy is that sounds  yeah specifically because you're bucking threes I don't I think Clay's gonna come around at some point at you know he's not that old I don't think he's completely fallen off the cliff yet and you know Bruce Brown's played better of late I mean he was pretty rough to begin the year but you know the Steels have really come around he's got multiple seals and four straight games he assists or starting to climb as well he's at 12 three and a half boards three assists 1.7 steals with pretty good percentage is over his last six you know not really giving you a whole lot from three but that's you know not really what you're banking on what comes to Bruce Brown anyway so he's been to me about his expected it's a pretty tough choice I mean we get a ton of questions branded about Ty's Joan's and really the Wizards in general it you know it's it's been really up and down you know in that Milwaukee game dice Jones 22 7 and 7 with a steal like that's kind of what we thought we would get a lot more office that's easy but of course you know one night later Four Points four assists in 24 minutes  you mean who knows maybe better days are ahead for the Washington Wizards I'm gonna see them at the Amway Center tonight so I can give you the full report of what that team looks like yeah if you could get in there and ask ties Jones like okay what's going on with your fantasy yeah and a little more out of you that a lot of questions about you but  Ian asked all right now I category League he's got to choose one of these three Kiante George scoot Henderson or says keyonte George and Scoot Henderson or I Strauss I was back strews so basically would you prefer the George slash scoot side of this or Max  um I think I'd go with Max shrews  give me  the just give me the better player with a high shooting the good from three yeah I mean keyonte George I'm starting to come around I was not really a Believer early on you know it was kind of just the assist that you were chasing there and you know he's started to play more minutes he's started to do a little bit more outside of that you know is that 14/4 and 6 over his last seven games he's just you know he's gonna kill you in the percentages much like scoot Henderson so and with this being a nine cat leaked like scoot's gonna be a high turnover guy he has been already I don't think that's really Gonna Change Portland to General is just a high turnover team so in nine categories specifically I think I would lean strips because you know both both Scoot and keyonte George could shoot under 40% they could both be you know three four turnover per game guys and I think that's gonna hurt you more than it's going to help you  I mean look at some of these percentages for Maxwell's there's just not a lot of guys in the league that are giving you this with the volume that he's shooting from three 43% 44 percent 43% 50 50 3350 that's that's those are really good numbers and if so if you're Chasing You Chasing category scoring you need that he's been playing really well all right our guy now says nine category League should I drop Brogden or Bogdan bogdanovich he said he's punting field goal and free throw percentage this week I know the percentages for Brogden have a big great so far so that's that's a little relevant but I don't think for either these guys you know you're necessarily all that worried about you know short-term field goal and free throw percentage this is this is an interesting one though I mean Brodin project continues to play pretty well is kind of the the Elder Statesman you know of this this Portland Trail Blazers team you know the counting stats have been there for the most part 18 for and six you know averaging is most assists per game since his first year in Indiana back in 2019 20 but he issued 41% from the field so that's been the one drawback did you have a strong lean one way or the other here yeah I mean you'd expect more defensive stats from Brockton being the defender that he is and he's not really giving that maybe that corrects itself maybe the problem is that he's on an island and Portland  but I would still go Malcolm Brogden here I mean as far as the player I'd want to keep on my roster I know they were asking who they want to drop right I mean it's it's been a debate because you could argue that bug damage has been just as good if not better over the last couple of weeks I think you know what Jalen Johnson going down you're immediately thinking all right saddiq Bey de'andre Hunter but I think there's been some trickled out to bogdanovich as well I mean these averaging almost 20 points per game over his last date not doing a whole lot outside of that he is giving you over a steel per game but not really rebounding all that much you know not really giving you any assists so kind of depends what categories you're targeting he has been shooting a ton of three he's taking he's taking 10 or more threes in five of his last eight games so if that's a category of Need for you this week I would look into that when it comes to block danovich and schedule wise yeah the Hawks play the Hawks play Thursday and Saturday and the Portland Trail Blazers the rest of the week they play Thursday Saturday so about the same I mean that's that's really close I think I would probably give slightly into Brockton as well all right Ian asks I have KD and Kauai I'm worried about the rest of season health and might cause me to lose any advice if I can flip them and who I should be targeting yeah this is a question that we get a lot and something that we've talked about on a bunch of PODS like I feel the same way I mean for the most part I just I don't draft KD or Kauai I had Kauai in one team last year and it actually went okay you know considering how many games he missed like he was so good but he played that it kind of made up for it but I understand the concern yeah I think you and I talked about this last week like do you  you know who are like realistic targets I guess if you feel like all right I got a great 20 games out of KD but I think he's gonna miss 20 at some point you can get you should be able to get just about anybody right I mean there's no maybe we talked about Tyrese Maxie said 28% in terms of the most successful teams in fantasy can you can you flip him for for a maxi  I think yeah somebody like that Maxi you know you could look at like Scotty Barnes I mean you could even you could try to do I don't know Donovan Mitchell somebody Edwards you could strike you know strike all the iron's hot Anthony Edwards took a tough spill less night he should be okay so these are you could Target right I would I would throw out a ton of offers I mean you might be able to get you might be able to get Jayson Tatum even like I would much rather have him I know Duran spend the better fantasy player this year but Tatum has a vastly better track record of Health you know yeah you should be able to do okay there and he follows up and says all right you know would you do to rant Kawaii and Brogden for SGA cam Johnson and hero  yeah I'm not what I really want SGA for sure yeah but packaging Kawaii and KD I think I'd rather try to sell those guys and separate deals  agreed completely agree I think you're you're bringing on a great player you're you're kind of  your mindset your heads in the right place here but I think you're going a little bit too hard in the paint he's the best basketball reference yeah all right I'll walk a Flocka Flame reference as well all right we have a self-described new question yeah that's my first year in Roto if my player has a game and I put him in my active slot but he's a dnp so he either doesn't play or he's heard does it consume a game at the position  I think so it depends on your league right like if you're doing if you're in a weekly league and you put let's say you have Lori Market in in your lineup on Monday and he didn't play he's locked for the rest of the week right unless you have a league where like the NFC for example you could set another lineup that that runs from Friday to Sunday but mostly you know that are weekly if that if that if that player doesn't play he's still in your lineup for the week you can't remove him it counts as like an active game if you're in daily lineup League's obviously you can get them out of there I assume he might be asking about like leaks that have game limits per week I that's super league specific I'm not really sure I would I think it does count though  I would think so I mean I either way if the players in your starting lineup in the lineups lock whether that's for the week or for the day then that that players taking up that spot even if they they're DMP and this is the frustrating part of fantasy props bedding in the NBA it's something you have to deal with and you have to wrap your head around through the through the course of the Season you might not find out until they do the player introduction yeah  it does feel like it's got a little better compared to last year am I wrong on that like I felt like at this point last season we were all ready up in arms know it's like man this is played fantasy basketball is just it's a losing game if you're in a weekly lineup League it's been a disaster like I do feel like I don't know if it's by virtue of the n Season tournament or not I would say probably not that we haven't we haven't seen as many teams you know going to the extremes when it comes to rest specifically mmm  I do remember last year being pretty problematic last year it doesn't feel that so it's it either either we've become desensitized to it  or it has gotten better I don't know which is true  any update on the Jeremy Sohan injury I have not seen anything today or yesterday Sohan exited Sunday against Denver with what they just said was knee soreness was ruled out for the rest of that game  I I'm not really sure kind of a unique situation because they were off Monday they were off yesterday they were off tonight and then they play Thursday against Atlanta and they have a back-to-back Friday at New Orleans so we'll get news today but you know it's kind of like the NFL like if it's a team plays on Monday night you're always like you know a day behind on the injury report so they're not really gonna say anything on Monday when the game's not until Thursday but we showed we should get an update you know the NBA mandates that we get an update at some point today on Sohan but the fact that it's knee soreness as opposed to like you know him going to the ground with like a true knee injury  you know maybe maybe he misses these next couple of games I don't think it would be long term no I don't see how especially if he didn't have a serious knee injury last year I think that's when you look at a soreness injury and you can say that that's gonna keep him out for an extended length of time I believe that that's the actual diagnosis for markelle fultz right now is these soreness so it but he's a guy who came off of a serious knee injury I don't think so on is dealing with that well what let's talk about Folks by like what is what is going on there yeah we get a ton of questions mark helpful do you have do you have any insight Beyond you know the basic injury reports  I can tell you that he is I saw him running stairs the other day in the arena so it's not like he can't move its  an injury maintenance thing I honestly no idea what the timeline is but he looks good to me and my guess is he's gonna make his way back soon I think we went I think we see Wendell Carter Junior back in the starting lineup before we see Mark how folks but just guessing I'd be surprised if we wanted another full month without faults in the lineup  all right interesting trade question here from our guy James Jeremy Grant and Jordan Clarkson for John Collins and Anthony Simon's mmm  I think I'd rather have  the first end  yeah this is this is a really even trade I was kind of leaning the other way because I think I want to effort excitements most you know John Collins has been about as expected he's been extremely consistent if nothing else right I actually kind of thought he might have an opportunity to take a bigger leap but unfortunately the shop blocking may never come back and part of it is he's you know basically playing the three in Utah so he doesn't have as many opportunities but you know I guess we're not talking like four years ago he was a 1.6 blocks per game guy and you know he's half of that this season you know not really giving you any steals he's under an assist per game so you're really just targeting him for points rebounds at threes with just fine you know shoots a good percentage just well he's over 40% from three Jeremy Grant fairly limited as a fantasy player points rebounds you know every now and then you get the defensive stats as well but I think if you're if you're chasing upside like if you're if you're in the middle of the pack or you're kind of lower down in your league I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Simon's because I think he's the best player in the highest upside guy in the deal  yeah these sort of deals like I end up just sort of going why what's the what's the purpose of it when you're doing a two for two and it's and it's even across the board I just think there are better deals to be I think we're just making trades to make trades at that point well which you know what hey if you want to do that yeah what I sympathize with that right it's tough if you're if you're in like you know like the rotavirus take league for example 16 teams it's like there's you know you'll move up or down five spots at any given night and it it's tough to sit there idly if you're if you're going in the wrong direction  it's true you know if you're trying to send your team a message then you go ahead get it done yeah you gotta think about the locker room right you know what is Jeremy Grant mean to your team is he a better leader on that team good point we just talked about foals but we'll address this one by from Ian do I continue to keep folds on the eel in a 12 team 9 cat or is he droppable  I got the sense from what you just said Brandon that you probably keep him in that slot for now  yeah and I think he's gonna put up numbers when he comes back he'll be able to be somebody that will fill up some of those categories that you need what's amazing about what the magic are doing right now outside of the fact that they're doing it that they've won seven in a row which they haven't done since Dwight Howard was on the roster is that they're doing that's it that's it wow so yeah 12 wins on the season incredible and it should continue they have two games against the Wizards coming up this week but I know we're looking at a 10 game winning streak coming up was that where is it going with that oh they're doing without a true point guard I mean Anthony black is I can't even say he's playing bad like I don't I don't even notice he's out there sometimes he's not he's not doing anything and Cole Anthony's played great but they're keeping his role to a sixth man Off the Bench microwave score type so when folks comes back he's as much as they're just winning no matter what like they need what he brings to the table you got to have a point guard in the NBA if you're gonna have sustained success  all right ten team nine category League he ain't George is available  should I drop in a nobby or Jalen Williams for him  I would say no yeah I wouldn't do that now I know Anna nobody's been pretty disappointing so far he's ranks actually outside the top 100 which is pretty shocking you know the free throw percentage has been really bad he's you know hovering around 60%  although he's not really players are just so disappointing this year  yeah unless you have Scotty Barnes are I guess Dennis Schroder that's been pretty disappointing I'll see how come he's got it together you know I complained a lot about him early in the season and is overall raking is still not great partially because he's you know just not giving me any defensive stats and the other free throw percentage like every game he's like four for six from three or from from the line but the county stats are started to come back with him I mean again it's not the value that you were hoping for but I actually pretty optimistic about siakam yeah I know he's tough I mean it's I mean that's a guy that you were drafting maybe is what his highs the fifth or sixth round  and you know to cut it to cup 8 on him for keyonte George would feel like  selling at the absolute bottom I'm very Pro Jalen Williams you know I know he missed some time recently that that maybe you know rub some people the wrong way but I I'm still so pretty high in him I definitely would not drop Jayla Williams I think the arrival the arrival of Chet home you know has baby rubbed a little bit of The Upside off of Williams but he's still you know to fight a guy like him at his age she was like guaranteed to shoot 50% from the field and he spent an awesome free throw shooter at a fairly high volume 17 for and four every night a good percentage is I definitely would not cut bait there but the end it helped me question is is weirdly a fair one it is and I get it you know when a guy heats up the way the keyonte George has you want to get your hands on that it's tempting but is it sustainable I just don't really know what we're chasing with him is keyonte George the kind of guy that's gonna put your roster over the top I don't think so OG and Adobe at his best is one of those type of players so it's frustrating as it is you know unless you just like Nick said I think that there's all comes down to a lot of these questions and we'll repeat this as much as we need to to just steady your minds out there a lot of this comes down to what is your team look like in terms of win-loss record are you on a streak and a negative direction and you just need to make a move to do something different a totally get that but if that's not the case then I just don't think you can't say George is Gonna Keep Up what I think he's on a nice little stretch here double digit points and each of these last three but I don't think that this is something that's that's Uber sustainable with all the mouths they have to feed and that you talk phones  see I actually think it's fairly sustainable because I think this team's going in the wrong direction and I think he's gonna play a ton of minutes the rest of the way I just the percentage is the turnovers and a nine category League  you know I think he's gonna be a good player in terms of the county stats are there but  you know rookie guards just tend to not be good fantasy players and I think on balance you know if you're asking like who's the better fantasy player for the rest of the year who was a better chance to finish higher it's got to be in an Obby right I mean I think you have to look at this as kind of just a slow start and you know maybe he gets moved and that might be for the best for Brandon Obi at this point who would you prefer rest of season tyus Jones or Chris Middleton in a nine category rotol League  tough I if you think Middleton's staying healthy I would definitely take Middleton like you still putting up decent numbers despite playing 20 minutes a game you still giving you 12 4 and 4 and you know I think eventually you get to the point where maybe he's not playing 35 minutes tonight but even even 28 minutes a night would be huge for Middleton  yeah it's tough with Middleton because you I mean you can see the decline so evident but he's still at his best a pretty good player  not shooting at a as a great percentage the three balls at 33% and in terms of the the month of November it was even worse prior to that it just feels like he's starting to Decay a little bit too quickly for me and I like tyus Jones We've already seen the worst days for the Washington Wizards I mean it literally can't get any worse so if you made it this far I think I'd stick with tyus Jones okay okay well agree to disagree on that one you know Middleton has been it's been disappointing from three but he's shooting like 70% in the mid-range and that's that's still carrying him to like 47% from the field overall so that's been offset to some degree if you look at the per 36 numbers he's right in line with where he's been in his best seasons right I mean for 36 he's at 22 points almost eight rebounds seven assists 1.2 steals I mean that is right in line with what you think of for Chris Middleton before all the injuries set in so if you're sticking with Chris you have to accept the injury risk and you know at any point he could go in the wrong direction but again like you like you always say it kind of depends where you are in your league and I think if you've been holding khris Middleton to like punt on him now you know as he seems to be kind of ascending in the right direction like I don't think he's gonna play 22 minutes most nights the rest of the season like they're gonna bump that up at some point so I would say that upside  James says where do you think Levine will end up after the trade deadline to have him on my team should I trade him  well I think you should wait  he becomes much more valuable on a new roster  so it yeah we don't know I mean we'd be guessing at this point but just it's just the way that it goes is what a guy gets traded his his value Source because we all think so optimistically about what this guy's upside in a new offense could be and all of that I would trade him the day he gets dealt that would be my move  he's holding up a Heat jersey I put him on the Block  do you think you know if he lands in Miami or he lands in Philly or Los Angeles like that's a better situation than Chicago because I mean the Bulls are disaster and they play at a slow pace I get all that but I I don't know if he's going to a team or it's like all right you're the number one option now it's like I think it would be and you can make the argument that he's you know it's kind of a three-man team in Chicago right with booster and DeRozan so but if you goes to LA or he goes to Philly it's like you played alongside MB you know I think if anything if he answered Philly that's that's not good for Tyrese Maxey that would be just know it but you know in general it's like is he going somewhere where he fits in similarly in terms of like the hierarchy and the offense probably not but I also think that his efficiency could see a boost so you know you kind of get a play for the Bulls yeah you can get a balance there but I I think in terms of changing overall values it really is going to impact the guys that are playing around him more than him a team that's trading for him we've said this about Buddy hield all the way through if you're trading for Zach LaVine you're trading for something very specific you're going to use him for that role so he's still gonna get his and I think he can do it at a more efficient clip but how does it impact the guys around him we just don't know where he's going to go so we're just we're just guessing yeah my guess is it is one of those teams I think it's I think it's a contending team you know I don't I don't really see I don't need a Philly's gonna do it though Phillies kind of I think Philly is is good where they're at I really think that they are happy to just run everything through the two main game of indeed and Maxi and just get contributions from the role guys I get the I get  the impression that they're not going to make a move like that Miami maybe because they've swung and missed so many times on Starz they make a move and the Lakers are never out of it when it comes to the discussion like this so I would say Lakers he feel like the most likely all right we got a couple Trey Murphy questions that will hit thoughts on Trey Murphy can you be in the top 75 that comes from Ian and then Victor asks you know better rest of season bogdanovich so we're talking Pistons or Trey Murphy in a points League  to that second question I would say maybe Bowie on you know we had we had Dan Titus one of the great fantasy basketball Minds on the the XM show last night he was pretty optimistic on volkanovski disaster for 38 in their last 42 games they're going for 15 straight losses tonight so you can kind of see it's like it's probably on volcanic the missing piece I don't think so but this is all kind of a delusional franchise that might just throw them in there for 30 minutes tonight and be like okay we need to raise our floor tonight so in a points League I think I might give slight favor to Bowie on just you know be prepared for some sort of antics whether that's like trading him or his role going all over the place night tonight you know the thing with trade Murphy is he is very three-point dependent he's an amazing three-point shooter he's high volume he's over 40% I think that should continue but you know the Pelicans are going to be a fascinating roster he's back and again that could that could come as soon as Friday against the Spurs he's doubtful to play tonight I don't think we see him on the court we will get McCollum back but but not Murphy but he should be back within the next two or three games at worst at that point you know you got McCollum you got Jose Alvarado back in the mix obviously Brandon Ingram herb Jones Dice and Daniels Jordan Hawkins you know Matt Ryan might even be a part of this rotation Naji Marshall Zion like I guess the overall question is like is there enough room for Trey Murphy to put up the type of season that he did last year when he saw 31 minutes a game no they put up some great numbers last year but it's just simply not sustainable with the guys that they've got that you know are going to get theirs on that Pelican Squad he's got these got the potential to do it I think he'll be productive but to ask for what he was able to produce last year's just simply unrealistic  how much of that comes down to Zion specifically you know because I think nobody benefited more from Zion playing 29 games then Trey Murphy played 79 last year  yeah it's huge it's huge and Zions playing well right now so there's no reason to to limit his minutes and you getting McCollum back bringing room is going to get his and Alvarado I mean it's just we talked about guys like Dyson Daniels I mean Jordan Hawkins has had positive moments with this team as well so it's just as there's so many mouths to feed it's a good problem to have if you're a Pelicans fan but right now in terms of overall optimism for Trey Murphy it's hard it's hard to get there but you know you certainly like the players so he's somebody I want on my roster but I think you get to keep your expectations in check  okay we got a few more than we'll get out of here is Mike Conley a must roster hi depending on your league size I would say yes you know 10 12 Team league he's probably should be rostered it was 36 at this point so you do worry about that catching up to him at some point but he played 67 games last year he played 72 the year before you had some injuries his first couple years in Utah but you know for the most part I think his game should aged pretty well we're seeing you know more and more guys from from those like you know 2006 2017 2008 drafts you know played later and later into their careers you know the assistant are really the thing you're chasing here and those have been there for the most part this year he's been doing pretty well racking up steals as well you know low volume on offense but he's been pretty efficient he didn't take 10 3 pointers last night I would say he's a monster for me yeah yeah I like Peace's of good teams and the Minnesota Timberwolves are playing is good as anybody else and I don't know if there's if Anthony Edwards is gonna miss any time I'm not sure if that's a positive for him or not just because of the distribution that  you get from Mike Conley but you know usage would certainly be up yeah I like him and he's gonna give you a couple steals per game too yeah the one thing with him is the free throws have completely dropped off and that that happens to point guards later in their career he is he's not Misty free throw this season but he also has barely taken in he's only taking 14 total free throws in 17 games so losing some some value there but in general I think you want the assist you want the steals you want the dependability speaking up my Conley  a solar Thompson and keyonte George or OG and Conley in a nine category League  you know if you're  glancing it keonte George's stats over the last couple of games so I think I might be slightly intoxicated we've been getting a lot of questions about him but start tomson I love what he's been able to do this year with the Pistons it seems like I mean he's a guy that's just gonna give you  he's gonna give you defensive production like not a lot of other players certainly at his youth are going to in the NBA I don't want to trade a start Thompson so that makes it easy for me and I get the scoring with keyonte George that's got to be the side yeah I've got it two schools of thought here right you got it basically two rookies versus two establish veterans who have been you know have the track record who bet better fantasy players throughout their career but yeah it's tough to it's tough to part ways with the Tsar Thompson right now I mean in a category League there's a pitfalls obviously you know the percentages and you know the fact that you just can't shoot three is whatsoever is a problem but I think there is a little bit more upside on that side of it do you think it's time to get rid of Josh giddey my replacement choices are Jade and Ivy Cole Anthony and DeAndre Hunter  oh um well Kohl's playing great the Android Hunters playing great  so yeah I don't want Ivy like I know he's playing more lately I don't I just don't trust the Pistons with him and he's also a better real life player than fantasy player so I would not drop Kitty for Ivy and you know there's the off the court stuff that could be a part of this my read on it right now is like I don't I just don't see a suspension or anything coming in the near future you know there's all kinds of random reporting most of it coming from like TMZ and BSO it's not so like I don't know what to believe with that but I I think if the Thunder thought this was like a major problem that they wouldn't have thrown them out there the other night you know to me that that says a lot that all this you know kind of broke over Thanksgiving weekend and obviously everybody was aware of it and giddy got asked about in that practice and they still played him the other night you know I think that would have that would have sent a little bit more fear into me if they if they held him out I think they feel pretty confident that he's gonna be on the right side of this whatever that actually means but yeah I think Cole Anthony and DeAndre Hunter versus giddy in a vacuum if we just remove that from the equation that that becomes a more interesting question yeah I mean it's not like giddy you take the off the court stuff out of it which could become part of the equation makes this question a lot more a lot easier to answer but if you remove that it's not like giddy has been lighting it up so I don't think you probably  drafted him he's not quite living up to his ADP at this point I think as of I'd have a hard time getting rid of Josh giddey just because he is such an incredible player and if there is no suspension you know he's probably gonna see much better days ahead than what he's giving you right now but yeah I mean flip a coin Anthony DeAndre Hunter I'd love to roster both of those guys I would go hunter first with the caveat that you know you got a month here without Jalen Johnson and that's I think when you're really gonna make your make your bones on Hunter and there's gonna be probably a reduction after that you know with Cole Anthony you just worry about what happens when folks comes back  yeah yeah I I think his role his roles pretty much solidified especially if he if he continues to score the basketball the way that he has they're not gonna limit his minutes because Mark helps his back in the in the rotation because they play completely different style folks is going to distribute Kohl's gonna score and for a team that struggles on the offensive end they haven't been lately but that's going to be their issue whenever they do end up  settling back closer to the mean of what they are they need what Cole Anthony provides and he's been a much better Defender too so it's starting to show up a little bit in the stats but I can just tell you from from watching him up close and personal it's a part of his game he's put a lot of energy and emphasis into getting better at  all right two more Justin asks cam Thomas rest of season outlook once he returns this is so so difficult because he's such a unique player you know Brooklyn it they're hanging around they're nine and eight right now I think they're going to be in that play and mix so ultimately you know I think it's not just going to be a all right go get your numbers situation like I think they're still gonna prioritize winning games can Thomas for what it's worth did not play last night against Toronto seems like he's getting close could be back Thursday they play Saturday against Orlando as well you know like when he was going on his run early in the season you know camp Camp Johnson have been out of the lineup they had a few other injuries you know Ben Simmons who knows if for when he's coming back you know I  went to Camp Thomas I mean it's an interesting thing from a fantasy perspective because you're really you really just chasing the points the threes and the free throws which are valuable categories right and I think even if he's even if he is playing reduced minutes you know in a bench role like we saw at times last season like he could still pretty easily gets you 20 plus a night so I'm I'm optimistic man I mean I think he's somebody that we always knew had this ability and you know in the past they they never really threw up there I think there was some defensive concerns some continuity concerns but you know it was encouraging to me that they were willing to you know play him 30 plus minutes per game to start the year yeah I mean you are chasing points but he's also a guy that's worth chasing in that category there aren't a lot of players in the NBA that can that even have the ability to put up 40 plus and he is one of them so I'm a sucker for his production I think he's somebody I would definitely hang on to Target you know however it is you're you're viewing that as you look for the Outlook  okay last one you think scoot Henderson can pick it up soon and perhaps be a top 100 player at least this season and our guys playing in a nine category League I I think we'll see plenty of flashes I think he will pick it up I think there will be weeks where he looks really good I would be pretty surprised if scoot Henderson finishes the year inside the top 100 especially in a nine cat League I don't I don't really see that being the case you know I think turnovers are gonna continue to be an issue I mean how many games has he played he's played eight games this season he's had at least four turnovers and five of those games playing fairly limited minutes I just you know the guys around him and in Portland aren't really gonna help especially once they have any Simons is back I think that takes away some of the scoring upside so I I think we're gonna come out of this season like feel pretty good about the player going forward I don't see as you know looking back and saying wow what a great second half he's 88th and fantasy like I just I don't rookie guards in general like that it just doesn't happen even rookie cards you play really well just those guys don't finish high in fantasy yeah I know we didn't get a large look at large sample of him in the summer league but what I saw I mean it just makes me not want to watch it anymore because I I just get drunk off of this limited information that we have and he looked amazing but yeah it doesn't necessarily translate to to the NBA regular season and he hasn't put it together yet he's not getting the minutes and and we just haven't seen that level of production so while I certainly believe in the player and he's a guy that I might stubbornly hold on to a little bit longer the most likely scenario is that he finishes outside of the top 100  here's some context on that Brandon Anthony Edwards as a rookie  nine category per game value he finished 117  you know and it's scooter said that's the potential maybe for more assistance Anthony Edwards did but I felt like a pretty damn good rookie season for Anthony Edwards and he still finish outside the top one fifteen I get it just doesn't happen very often like rookies in general but it's specially rookie guards you know and especially a night category leaks you just don't see many guys step in as like really good fantasy assets right away even if they're there  yeah it's tough It's A Hard it's a really hard position to excel in early on in your NBA career yeah okay we got one more coming in under the gun here from Daniel Terry Rozier or miles Bridges should I keep both or drop one to pick up cam jobs and it's in an 18 League that's gonna be fun gotta feel pretty good about your roster I think so I I would not drop miles Bridges I think he's got too much upside I would take him over cam Johnson Rozier versus Johnson is an interesting one though  you know with the lobelo ball injury I don't think I would drop either let me see how this one shakes out and we'll see you ends up with the most production with him not on the floor but my guess is Rozier is gonna do pretty well and I agree miles Bridges his upside he's looked really good as of late and and it looks like Steve Clifford's getting more comfortable with involving him in that offense  yeah I would probably stick with with those two I mean Rosie versus cam I think it's gonna be really really close I think for the next month you might want Rozier I think for the balance of the Season you might want cam jobs in I think the percentage is with Cam you know that's that's what my sway me you know Rosie's not a great free throw shooter takes a decent amount camera Johnson you know could be like close to 90% at the line you know should be more efficient as a shooter as well and I think Rose year could averaged more points but I think the efficiency with John Cena by pushing over the top so I would go cam Johnson and Miles Bridges if I pick a two of those three all right Brandon let's get out of here man fun chat with you as always thank you to everybody who gave
