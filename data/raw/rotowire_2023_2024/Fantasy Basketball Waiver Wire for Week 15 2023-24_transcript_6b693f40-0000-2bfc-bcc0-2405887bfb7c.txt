welcome everybody to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy and FanDuel it is Friday January 26th Alex perucca here with Shannon McEwen and Ken k train Crites  all aboard  we had the All-Star starters announced last night in the East Giannis and bead Tatum Lillard and Halliburton in the west LeBron that's James yokich KD Luca and SGA Shannon as is tradition is there anybody that you think was either snubbed or maybe you just would have preferred to see as an All-Star or one person that you think maybe doesn't deserve to be there  yeah I think in general all 10 starters definitely deserve the the nomination I the only one I really have any qualms about is Lillard he's having it fine here for Milwaukee in his first year as a buck but there are two East guards yeah I actually done even Mitchell would be my number one choice to to replace Lillard and then Jalen Brunson so so one of those two guards I think would be more deserving then Damian Lillard but solid collection probably you know arguably the 10 best players in the league or 10 of the 12 best players in the league in the starting lineup so it's hard to really nitpick any of those options  yeah I mean I'm a bucks fan I don't I don't hate the idea of either Mitchell or of Brunson being there I mean again Lillard's been good just he's Damian Lillard he's only gonna be so disappointing to an extent Ken you still hate this All-Star game I remember we used to we you and I did like a social media breakout one time where I'm like I love All-Star Weekend slam dunk contest sign me up you were like no this is a joke it's a joke no defense  I don't want anyone to get hurt  I just I don't even like to watch it it's a good time to do chores around the house  it it definitely has become less and less watchable I will I will give you that like I just I almost feel like I have it on in the background at this point like I'm on my phone you know and I mean I don't care just get something done with this garbage is on the air yeah  yeah okay well  I'm I'm still looking forward to All Star weekend but mostly for the brake injury reporting exactly it and hopefully we can get some good participants in the slam dunk contest I don't even know if that's been I don't have any of those have been announced have they like three points slam dunk yeah we'll see okay let's go get some real basketball Ken yeah let's go to New York where Spike Lee's Nick's blew out the Nuggets last night 122 to 84 at MSG OG on a nobby with 26 points and six steals all Nick starters Plus or better and point deferential NYX one this despite still being without Isaiah hartenstein again Achilles issue he's missed two games and of course Robinson's out for the year the Nuggets did have a day of rest but it was the end of a five-game road trip  and Denver did go three and two Alex and Shannon any reason for concern for the nuggets  um yes and no I mean they still can't win Road games they're 14 and 11 on the road we always know they're better at home there's a championship hangover thing that makes me not as worried where I think you know they they know they need to Coast this year compared to last year a little bit more at the same time to me this is almost more about the Knicks like how good they've looked and so Gina nobody got there oh gee nobody's Point differential is still an absolutely insane plus 404 per 100 possessions have never seen a number like that for this long of a stretch so I to me this is more about the next  yeah I agree there with with Denver I mean there they have 31 wins that's the the second highest total in the Western Conference a game and a half behind Minnesota half a game behind the Thunder I'm not really worried and the Nuggets just had a big road win against Boston recently so you know they're the only team I believe that has beat Boston I at home right so it's hard for me to really yeah give the nuggets any grief here the Knicks have been outstanding since OG is doing the team yeah it's I actually expected OG's line to be better as a Nick compared to his time with with the Raptors this year he's doing he is overall doing a much better fantasy player primarily because his his efficiency is increased he's got from 49% to 51 from the floor 71% to 88.6 from the free throw mine and then one one point eight three pointers down a little bit from what he hadn't Toronto but defense 1.8 Steals and 1.2 blocks per game as a Nick just crushing it for the for New York I really am surprised but  he's uh he's kind of taking that way we can keep that up it's only 13 games if he holds that value he's like a top 40 player yeah yeah Alex take us to Miami sir well I'm going to toss it to you pretty quickly because it was Boston that extinguished Miami 143 to 110 Heat 0 and 2 since the Rosier trade by I'll let you wax poetic about what you saw well I want Shannon's take on the Scary Cherry Scary Terry trade to Miami I'll tell you what it would solve the freak me out was Chris stops porzingis  falling like a broken chair left the game early in an ugly fall he stepped on bam out of BIOS foot rolled his ankle  but it was panicky at first but he did come back in his sweat suit post game he said hey I could have played if we needed to but you know we had a big lead I'm sure they'll still give them the next game off but I got a little nervous about losing the unicorn but I think you know if you've got the unicorn on your fantasy team you're used to these frequent one game misses there's probably another one coming but my goodness they blew out the heat in Miami which is good to see after last year's Eastern Conference Finals yeah I mean this was one of the games where Boston actually went full strength right they've been resting guys taking turns all in with you with who has a seat on a given night but they had a full strength total roster available last night and they dominated Miami I am not you know I think the acquired Terry Rozier was a great trade for Miami you know they gave up Kyle Lowry's contract and the first round pick Scary Terry it's gonna take some time he's a ball dominating guard they already have so some players like that who need the ball on their hands Tyler here and Jimmy Butler even hot as to an extent of his been out but I just think it adds this team it makes a shirt online a better there you go here is a much better basketball player than Kyle Lowry at their respective stages of their careers and it gets some more depth because now you have Joshua and Caleb Martin duck and Robson maybe hot as we'll see where once he's healthy  if he comes off the bench or if he replaces High Smith in the lineup and the starting lineup but he gives them a legit 89 man depth rotation of very solid players so I like Miami and the move for Miami overall I just think he's gonna take some time for the chemistry to build all so this for the heat you know they're all five game losing streak and Hawkins has been out for six games so he's missed all five of those losses I think he's a critical part of this heat rotation they should move Hawkes into the starting lineup in my opinion or at least make sure he's getting plus 27 minutes a game I think there's a good chance he starts over Highsmith once healthy yep all right let's go to Golden State last night the king's beat the Warriors in a thriller King's one 134 133 Harrison Barnes 39 points is second straight 30 plus points scoring night and fantasy wise Wiggins got to start again for the Warriors he went 174 and 4 and 31 minutes so Wiggins slowly earning legit minutes for the Warriors I think you pointed out last week's show but back to the Kings  after four games slide they've won two in a row is the arrow pointing up for Sacramento  you know sorta I mean like they Barnes he'll have one of these games on single a while right he'll score 39 and they'll score 8 and they'll score 12 and then that's how they'll go seven but he's lost last night so a little fortunate from behind the arc right yeah it's I think it's helped that Kevin herters playing better I mean that's that's a big part of it he was so bad through a lot of stretch of the season for those who have wrought you know drafted him in fantasy  but over the past five games he's averaging 17 points 50% from three that'll help but that's that's big for them I think they should be a team probably looking to add at the trade deadline I don't think what they have is enough but maybe tough to get there without giving up basically either all the picks they have or Keegan Murray  their bench after monkey gets thin yeah I highly doubt they would they would be interested in moving Keegan Murray at all here's some Barnes I think I'm the only person who rostered Harrison Barnes and their DFS lineup last night and did not cash oh my God three point three point five percent roster Don DraftKings 53 fans he points had him in my fourth spot and somehow did not cash you know even I don't know what's going on guys but here's some Barnes is in Fuego from downtown right now so we'll see if it carries on for a third straight game

code r w n b a it's now time for the fan feedback answer questions  and we're not getting any questions we're getting a lot of All Star chatter  we've answered everybody's questions I mean really what we got here oh here's one  is Jabari Walker of your Portland Trail Blazers pick up now option  thank you for the question James clutch  is he a pickup I mean look I think what you know we talked about him and I think it was last week's pod maybe yes briefly and Portland's on a four game week he's a very intriguing Prospect Portland is terrible I think they're going to continue giving a minutes  I agree with that assessment I you know he hasn't like like you said we recommended him last week to that I think like 12 team or deep 12 teams 14 teams I think he's absolutely worth picking up in in 10 teams it's a little bit more complicated because his minutes are going to fluctuate a little bit I mean even if you look at this most recent starting stretch its six games in a row that he started and he's bounced around he has 41 minutes one game 22 to the next 34 he's had some decent games a couple double doubles but he's not crushing it with like defensive stats he is hitting three-pointers you know over those the six games stretches starter 30 minutes 10.5 points 8.8 rebounds only only half a stock per game and 1.23 pointers percentages are okay 47% and 75 to me and attend Team league if it's a four game week or something you want to stream them that might make sense for as  long as he started but I think he's more of a 12 team or 14 team Target okay and one last one from our friend Mall ass  Grayson Allen or Scary Terry rest of season  oh wow that's not that's not a question I will have really concerned I think it is I think it is I think it's yeah it's a legit question at this point so I I don't know if we mentioned it from the Heat game Rozier his first game 9 points for rebounds five assists two Steals and a second game he started seven points to rebounds three assists one steal took 11 shots in the first game he did not he didn't he shot three of ten mostly he doesn't know their offense yet like it was a little clear it wasn't sure what he was doing he was trying to create his own shot off the dribble which is what they need  but it's like Boston has the two best defensive guards in the league  and they proved it with a confused Rozier who wasn't sure where he was supposed to be on the court all night  I would rather have Rozier like like cantaloupe to I think he was trying to figure in the matchup wasn't very good they also got smoked by Memphis the game before but Memphis very quietly playing pretty well lately but yeah Rozier go ahead hey I'm going Scary Terry as well I mean we like Grace now and we've talked about him quite a bit this season multiple times on our waiver wire section he's a good fit with Phoenix he's producing well he's providing fantasy so special for like 12 teams he's a no-brainer to roster but scary Terry has more upside and that's where I'm leaning you know I expect basically whatever production Kyle Lowry had last the last season or two with Miami I expect Scary Terry to match maybe maybe a few less assists you know in 2122 Lowry average 7.5 assists per game I don't think Scary Terry will get there but can you give you 12 13 points for game five assists a couple three-pointers yes I think you can and to me that overall value is going to top with Grace now and provides all right one last question in Washington higher ceiling for Bilal kolobi with the new head coach in place in Washington  I would say maybe I look cool Holly is just now polished offensive player his three-point shot he's been having them pretty well 38% from 3 pretty surprising giving what he did and he wasn't that covers you overseas he's a 66% free throw shooter to me a higher ceiling would probably come from like just playing more like playing like 35 minutes and stuff like 26 minutes um maybe they trust them a little more offensively but as long as Ty's Jones Jordan Poole Danielle kuzma as long as these guys are around and handling the ball there's just not that much usage for Kula Bali I don't ugly oh for five last night on 29 minutes a run minutes are there but if they kill your percentages I do think the upside is a little bit higher just because he  by default this team this team will move a couple piece is before the trade deadline they you know it might not be odd via it might not be accused my kind to be determine I highly doubt it's full but they will move a piece or two one of the one or two of their veteran piece before the trade deadline that will open up more playing time for Kula Bali so I do think he has more upside rest of season than what we've seen so far and you know with the fact that he in the past week he has a four block game he has a three Steel game so he could ride a lot of upside in the defense category specifically  all right and with that channel on Alex take us to the waiver wire the waiver wire is here two regular picks and one long shot is how this works typically for us on the way for wire show although I think a couple of us have some longer shots than usual like I have two long shots I think everybody else does close to as well I'm just gonna jump right into it Nick Richards of the Charlotte Hornets who is 33% roster I was shocked you know like a cartoon with the eyes come out of the sockets that he was only 33% rostered I again how am I even recommending him he  had like seven okay games like a row like where he only averaged 8 points on 60% shooting with like eight rebounds like a block he got hurt for four days I think everyone was like I don't need this please add him Mark Williams is quote not close to returning in Charlotte Hornets speak that being said career is over  as a starter for Nick Richards nine points nine boards 1.5 blocks 65% shooting 71% from the line not bad if you're a cat league and rostering Center's hornets have four games next week this is a you just have to add him um yeah I'm with I'm with you on that and Nick Richards mystery games but returned and had a great outing against Detroit one of his you know first 2010 game of the season yeah great yeah great percentages lately  Ken who's your wife's Justin I'm gonna ride the Harrison Barnes roller coaster for a week hey he's having a terrible season but he's exploded for 30  and 32 points on Monday he seems really old he's only 31 Kings score 118.7 basically 119 points per game that ranks seventh in these Association they've been picking up the pace lately King's have four games next week so I'm in for a one week stream of Harrison Barnes just to see if he keeps this heater going  and I just want I want everybody know that is one of our sales guys at RotoWire and he started off his Harrison Barnes take with hey  this guy sucks  expectations early getting the negative on the way I love it this is right Wolf of Wall Street over here but I think I think that's fine cat Barnes is one of those guys who on four game weeks yeah about the way if you shoot 20 times a game yeah the guy and see what happens yeah yeah you know they won the last two after losing four in a row maybe they're just giving him a real bright green light I'm willing to try it for a week  absolutely  Shannon my first recommendation of the week is a guy we talked about numerous times this year his roster percentage is trending up in a big way even in the past 12 hours about he's gained about 10% Jonathan kaminga is now 60% rostered for the Golden State Warriors he is absolutely been thriving since moving back to the bench role if you got Draymond Green back with this team now he over the past week kaminga is a top 10 player with averages of 25.6 points 6.2 rebounds 1.2 Steals and one point eight three-pointers he had a giant game against the Kings last night that's like three Giant games in a row he's absolutely worth rostering golden state does only have three games in the next week but I think you scoop upcoming a and just ride them for as long as he stays hot Yakima you know he can play into Steve Curry he's like I don't know what I'm doing here on all my role is and he's been pretty well since then I don't know if him and Kirk I sit down and it just it started working but and I don't know if you if you mentioned this Shannon I'm sorry I was reading some some great comments we got like I had Scott Engel Agatha Barnes last night knows he'll come in two more games coming up 22 straight games with double digit points on 59% shooting excellent so yeah definitely yeah I think it could be showcasing Wiggins a little move him before the deadline and get coming back in the starting lineup  you know I I'm kind of confused like I I go back and forth I think Golden State's gonna do because I don't know if we can just tradeable I just I think he's like a negative asset I think you have to actually dump him to somewhere in baseball you'd say well it will pay him 80% now take them right and yeah right it's like part of the reason they're back because he's bad so it's like you have to trade Flamingo and then I so I don't know but I don't know a team that would actually probably they have the Caps yeah and throwing Moses Moody throwing Moody with him maybe that's appealing you know Moody and Wiggins yeah some cakes yeah Detroit Pistons will see second rounders to the Pistons yeah they take a shot on  shape eventually speaking of taking a shot John konchar of the Memphis Grizzlies I wanted to recommend Luke Kennard but I'm pretty sure I recommend it him last year he's only 30 yeah he's only 33% roster cannard is 4% rostered conchar is so this is pretty much a deeply suggestion he's coming off an 11 10 2 assists one rebound excuse me one steal one blocked double-double the game before that he had five blocks the game before that he had six assists past four games for Khan six six and four with two point five stocks I don't know why he is talking to cambay Mutombo despite being and I double check this six foot five 200 and 210 pounds the Grizzlies have four games this week I guess a huge huge portion of this if you are a 16 Team league he is edible because there's four games and he showed  stuff lately someone must legally play for the Memphis Grizzlies yes they need the roster they need to put five players on the court and Again Luke Kennard is the preferred ad by recommending him last week for a deeply contract well as long as we're talking All-Star snubs fence Williams come on you gotta get them on there eventually I do love me some Vince Williams though but what you if you only listen to Fantasy Basketball podcast and consume no other basketball you would think Vince Williams is averaging like 25 a game I'm gonna bring up our cover guy who frankly is probably not available in your league but make sure Brandon Miller of your Charlotte Hornets  is not available on the waiver wire you gotta check on Wednesday morning he was available in 50% Elite he then shot up to 69% rostered on Thursday afternoon when I checked Friday morning it's up to 70% rosters but Mueller is on fire he's getting big scoring opportunities with scary Terry now in Miami this team's building around ball Miller and Mark Williams if he ever is able to walk again just make sure Miller's not available spend that Fab if you're in a weekly budget free agent bidding League over the last seven days he's a top 25 player he's lighting it up and he's finally getting stocks kind of a weird it's the opposite of the rookie wall we're seeing a late blossoming of Brandon Miller as they're giving them a lot of shots and Charlotte and I think balls making his life a little easier having a legit point guard versus maybe more a little scattered Rozier makes things easier for traditional Wing like Miller yeah with Gordon Hayward out Scary Terry out of town yeah you know basically makes Miller the number two or number three scoring option for Charlotte and most games you know depending on if Bridges is is lightening it up that game and Bridge is might not be long for Charlotte so yeah Miller's True Value should only go up from here over the past week top 25 player yeah here's this four game stats 2432 the percentages is the Shocker he couldn't hit the broadside of a barn first half of the season the last four games he's been hit in 57 percent ball probably deserves some of the credit for that Shannon who's your second pick you're bringing back a pod favorite yeah Gunner from Phoenix Sam Merrill guard 24% rostered top 60 player over the past week just crushing it from down town 5.73 for games three rebounds three assists 18.7 points over the past few games Cleveland has four games next week we know what Sam Merrill is that those five point seven three-pointers seem like it's an inflated number but he's you know he is normal clay heater on 50% over that stretch he's just a in three point guy he's going to get tons of looks from downtown you know over the past three games 12 attempts for game on 47% shooting that's that's not unsustainable from a guy like like Merrill you know I don't think there's much value outside of that three-pointer and it's gonna come and go but right now he fits the need for Cleveland if you're in the market for Sam Merrill Luke Kennard same type of players similar value I think I I think I prefer Kennard a little bit more because his role with that battered Memphis team is a little bit more secure but Merrell's that next option for you the Garland news Alex you got any update on Darius Garland coming back from that broken jaw soon um yeah it's supposed to be soon I mean I at the end of this month it was like the original date but it sounds like again it's one of those things where it's like if you have a broken jaw it's hard to eat you can't condition pain as a thing so I won't be surprised if the if the injury drags on maybe a little bit longer than that was Hope just it's a pretty serious injury so the current current stance is he was cleared for basketball activity around January 19th ruled out of the four game Road Trip that Cleveland was on at the time they're gonna return to home January 29th against the Clippers so we're looking at Monday night he could return as soon as next week but they also I did they only need to rush him back they don't lose anymore so like Jared Allen have been awesome lately down low without Mobley anyway we digress whose turn is it for a pick here  it's my turn yeah you got a second alongside Alex I do sorry I was looking up Brandon Miller stats I was like how is he random Miller hasn't missed the shot at the rim and the past four games by the way 12 of 12 and getting to the foul line I will soon move the Chicago Bulls someone I almost swore I would never recommend again but this is how this is how this works Zach lavine's out for another week so you're fairly safe there the student moo finally showing some aggression scoring the basketball but 15 points on 60 50 90 for shooting yes that will come down but he's taking at least two free throws in every game which is for him a massive accomplishment also three assists two and a half boards 1.7 stocks this is partially a recommendation because you have the trade deadline coming up and you know Levine DeRozan all these guys are on the Block they're in The Ether and so to assume was playing well his teammates could get traded you never know worth exploring bulls with three games so it's not necessarily like a must add in 12 you know it like it doesn't have to be a main priority in 12 teams but it was one of only eight teams with three games this week as a heads up  interesting I was tempted by soon but the three games scared me off so I went really boring with the Italian Stallion Simone fought heo playing for Utah still starting at small forward for those guys Utah has four games next week look he's not particularly good in any one facet of the game but he's kind of a poor man's Kelly Olynyk doing okay everywhere to last four games he scored in double digits in east of those four games he's averaged 12 and a half points almost six rebounds almost three triples over two assists while shooting 56% from the field the volume is never going to be there for fontecchio but again consistent and almost every category and the Jazz have four games next week only 13% Elite's I'm two for two about three pointers bet so I'm absolutely with you Ken he's a monster making a Benjamins yes Shannon let's go to your your Longshot yeah my Longshot we're going to go with another rookie amen Thompson um  I I just can't get over my infatuation with both of the twins I think they're fantastic they're stock upside just intrigues me no End Amen for for the Rockets is rostered 20% of leads right now he's he's been a top 100 player over the past week which did include one spot start when Freddie Van Fleet what was arrested for a game over the past six games tops in his averaging 92 points 6.5 rebounds 2.2 a assist and 2.1 stocks in that one spot started as well really saw everything he could do 15 points 14 rebounds five assists one steal did it was over two from downtown like his brother he still trying to find that long-range stroke but he is in across the board contributor when he gets the minute he is now firmly a part of the Rockets rotation  and this Rocket's team is somewhat you know tumbling down the standings there three and seven over their past 10 I would not be surprised if they keep losing if they move a veteran or two and free up minutes for some of their young guys including tops and for the stretch run that all right guys let's end with any drop suggestions I'm gonna throw out cam Johnson that's only have three games next week one of 18 teams with only three games he's averaging 9 points of contests over his last seven games that that look like a fabulous trade for the Nets last year but  it's not really working out as well so I think cam Johnson's very droppable you guys have any other drops  can't hold for me in 12 and 14 teams 10 teams absolutely I think he's worth there's better streaming options available yeah I don't I yeah we got asked about cam Johnson on Nick and I's and I was like yeah 10 team points League I'm you don't have to drop him you can kind of borderline but I got one for you Josh Getty  oh yeah well yeah  yeah I mean I he was on my bus list going in the season just doesn't fit that offense as well they need a more of a pure shooter in that spot  he drives yeah he doesn't get followed when he drives the hoop I would say if you're at points leagues points based leagues I like them quite a bit more yeah yeah he does worry me with some of his efficiency and over the past three games for instance only shooting 40% from the floor and 50% from the free-throw line here's our other drop can they all the others on the Mavericks the Mavs have three points oh yeah next week who's been playing well outside of their star guard says wildly oscillated week to week so I think if you have one of the others on the maps you can drop them all right with that I think it's time to hear from our good friends at FanDuel yes FanDuel who sponsors our Friday NBA DFS chat which will be coming up later in

Atlanta although there are some injuries in that game two 44 and a half we also have Phoenix at Indiana 243 and a half was kind of surprised to see Phoenix only favored by four and a half they've been cooking lately but as I mentioned in Dallas and Atlanta Cavalier Irving questionable for this game Trae young Clint capela both questionable for this game so a little hard to evaluate right off the top but we have a decent string of games where there are seemingly no injuries actually it's a fairly light slate right now in terms of questionable and doubtful and probable guys so I'm the Slate Channel where you turning first yeah I mean the first game of interest is going to be that top over under with Dallas and Atlanta and the Trae young and capella news are you know they Loom heavy over our heads when we're making these roster decisions because each player has like an obvious alternative that you're going to turn to you for DFS you know jonte Murray at point guard also by zdanowicz you know both of those players see a nice bump when Trey young sits and then capella if he's out obviously we go with okongwu he would be one of my absolute favorite plays he's 6100 on FanDuel  pretty expensive given his his role coming off the bench but if a congress starts for capella I think he's still worth that and then on DraftKings So Kong was considerably more affordable 4600  I will say a couple guys I like right off the bat we have this we have this Cleveland Milwaukee rematch which I'm fairly interested in and Jared Allen had a very big game against Milwaukee and the previous game 21 points 12 boards five assists and have a block though it took 19 shots that's massive he's 8300 right now on FanDuel look at 83 he is feeling isn't like Sky High it's not gonna have like a 90 Fantasy Point game right obviously but he's I don't think he's gonna let you down at that price I mean the last time he was under  like under 35 fantasy points was December 21st  so I think it's a really great floor play if you're in a cash lineup I think that's a decent option  anything else Shannon  yeah I mean one one other nugget to point out with chair Allen is the fact that Tristan Thompson was suspended for 25 games he's on steroids hey this that explains it all right now we know why he was still in the classes like  no wonder the guy went off on me he's all right  but yeah Tristan Thompson was surprisingly seen significant minutes off the bench as the backup center Plains 16 minutes over his most recent nine games so Jared Allen could see his minutes increase significantly that wasn't the case in the first game without tops and out against the Bucks Ellie only played 32 minutes but they're going to be nights where he needs to play 40 minutes to pay on how how the just the flow of the game's rolling and how competitive it is so I do like Alan as an option tonight a couple other guys we should note in this Toronto Clippers game  Toronto is at home but Clippers are favored by seven and a half and not just because not only is yakub Pearl out but a manual quickly is also out so you know gut feeling for me I think decent options are like RJ Barrett Dennis Schroder as value plays the same at the same time  RJ Barrett is probably going to be checked by Paul George or Kawhi Leonard for decent chunk of the game or Terrence Mann so I would be a little bit worried about that I would almost just prefer Dennis Schroder at 5900 but to me at the again I don't feel like 5900 is a is like a steal for Dennis Schroder you know I don't feel like I'm slotting in my lineup and getting almost guaranteed value now even before they acquired quickly Schroeder was oftentimes in that 6,000 range so I agree he is a a better value on DraftKings then he is FanDuel for tonight's slate 50 200 for sure on DraftKings I like him considerably more at 5200 then 59 on FanDuel but I think he's a if he's announced as a starter he is in play another Guard from a different game that I like quite a bit right in that same range 5400 from Mark hell folks on FanDuel he is back in the starting lineup played 29 minutes in his most recent game for Orlando I feel like we're getting there to the point where he's going to be playing 30 minutes or maybe top 30 minutes on a more regular basis and with that we'll come fantasy production  that game is interesting Memphis 6.1 underdogs I'm not gonna say I would take Memphis at 600 dogs at home but I would think about it super low over under on that game though 212 and a half just gonna say yeah well under what is this 1992 yeah a game's gonna get that game's gonna be a grind we also have pelicans at the Thunder I'm intrigued by Zion Williamson at 7900 on FanDuel um he weighs just as much as Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams combined in the front court so there could be some bully ball going on there Zions kind of having a weird season like he had 11 assists the last game out then you'll have like no rebounds and you'll have 10 rebounds and back reports but terrible the rebound he'll  he's a walking 30 to 35 fantasy points he's just 7900 I think a fairly good matchup for him so I would I would be looking into that yeah sub 8000 dollars ions always intriguing you know like you said walking 35 to 40 fantasy points and he can pop off and have 50 plus point out eating that's happened this season and in past years so I do I do like Zion as well  before we wrap this up sharing any any parting thoughts on roster Dame construction or anything like that yeah keep an eye on Kyrie Irving status if he's ruled out I like Tim Hardaway quite a bit more on both FanDuel and DraftKings khris Middleton on DraftKings 6300 I I confused by his salary it's gone down from 74 to 66 to 6300 over the past three games and he's crushing it he had 36 points 42 fantasy points against Cleveland just a couple nights ago I think with this team where he's at one is minutes you know he's routinely playing over 30 minutes now he's not he's not being held in check anymore because some kind of minutes limit this is a team that has a new coach rotations probably tweet a little bit and I think that's going to work two Middleton's Advantage because they're just going to try to get the best seat possible in the Eastern Conference so 6300 Chris Middleton he's my he's my best value for this slate I like I like to be honest joking about Middleton dunking the ball when he was trying to avoid talking about coaching changes yeah Middleton when he's healthy for box fans he's like he's like a comfort object these like a stuffed animal it's like I can just I'm watching it's like oh yeah and Middleton turn around Fade Away Great oh Corner three great nice time to honest great 25 and 5 perfect and DFS it can be the same as well when he's when he's healthy good like hash game building block but enough for us can it's time for your old man rant ARG  Miami's Heat culture is stupid on their alternate Court design each key area has the text quote hardest working best conditioned most professional unselfish toughest meanest nastiest team in the NBA unquote you know if you have to say it then it isn't true this squads 24 and 21 they just let the Celtics shoot 64% from the field Thursday night in Miami Luke kornet yes Luke kornet put 12 points on him and have you seen this crowd they're dark leather Tans trophy wives and accessories jewelry I've never seen so many Donatella versace's at a sports event action speak louder than words Miami  yeah putting that cord out with the jerseys and then like getting smoked that's that's tough that's yeah that's horrible it's like slapping the floor on defense then getting like dunked on immediately basically if you have to say it isn't true avoided any mispronounced names in this podcast nothing egregious obviously so I think I think we can wrap this up thank you everybody thank you to the the live listeners the the Chatters the Chatters helping other Chatters out that's

Randall said quote I'm not going to lie to you bro it's regular season I could care less  I like the fact that we won first and foremost you don't want to be on that end but we're building the right habits for me it only matters in April and quote attention passengers this three cars fantasy Trainwreck has hit the end of the line  that explains
