welcome everybody to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy and FanDuel it's Friday January 12th 2024 Alex barutha here with Sharon McKeown and Ken k train Crites all board  sorry that the user that said that can blew his ears out you will need to get your surgery Blow That Whistle for every episode that was worse you need two hearing aids now as the one let's start things off sorry about this Ken but my Milwaukee Bucks beat the Boston and clearly a match that had no schedule implications no no he's played a back-to-back the night before that went into overtime yeah not have two days of rest Advantage ahead of the Celtics and not travel from Boston to Milwaukee exactly terrible yeah but hey they were five to one in the second half of a back-to-back I just I know they had been good in these I thought they give him a challenge they did not you know honestly when Drew holiday missed the first three-pointer I was like oh we're in trouble because I was already for Duality Revenge game it is first three three like our first shot game fell short and I was like this is going to be bad and boom it was my worst nightmare but go ahead go ahead yes fuck scored 25 straight in the first half they were up by 43 at one point Celtics pulled the plug pretty early a lot of Sam Houser minutes a lot of painting pictures no starters after halftime yeah they went to the bench after halftime yeah I played well but you know is there anybody you want to see less when you're gassed on a back-to-back then got us coming at you probably not  we also had the the Drew holiday tribute video would you think of the video I watched it it was it was nice I mean it as far as tribute videos go it but it just kind of makes you as a box fan be like  man it was awesome and we had Drew holiday wasn't it just kind of made you sad for what was that's not it's not as fun as like a Brandon Jennings tribute video or like I don't know Brian Scalabrine yeah like a John A John Henson tribute video or something like that when he was on the Cavs  yeah I mean I I don't know maybe it's maybe it's better to talk about Ken you know they the the Celtics had a hard fought game against Minnesota the night before that's probably really did yeah really put it all into Tatum and Brown's hands for all the scoring it's kind of what people expected more out of the Seas versus the production they're getting out of Dwight and others but it's an 82 Game season you know heck we had guests over was an excuse to actually not watching an entire cell to game and so I bail that time as well and  pretended to be a good host  I don't think there's anything to read into it it's a schedule loss I yeah I think there I think your guess would find a strong correlation between Celtics blowouts and how good of a host you are  like wow Ken's being really nice lately oh  not hiding in the basement with his glass of bourbon exactly right another news the Thunder completely utterly destroyed the Trailblazers in OKC 139 to 77 how do you score only 70 seven points in today's NBA I don't know all five OKC starters had a point deferential of plus 39 or better scoot Henderson the Trailblazers rookie he shot four of 21 he had three turnovers and a point differential of minus 56 minus 56 he did grab six boards I'll give them that  Shannon when do the Portland Trail Blazers trade 29 year old Jeremy Grant  he would expect that to happen soon and I'm happy that I made it four minutes and complete silence to start this episode I think that's a new record a new personal best a Jeremy Grant and also Brogden you have to assume both of them are going to be moved at some point this year you know last night's game for the Blazers their 10 and 27 they're playing a hot OKC team who's even even though they're coming out okay so he was playing the second half of back-to-back it's not a surprise to see those results you know last night was just a brutal slate overall with all of the blowouts but I you know I'm not excited personally if I roster Jeremy Grant on a season-long redraft team this year I'm not excited for him to get moved I think it's highly unlikely wherever he goes right I mean there's a good chance I think he'll be a starter but he's not going to be the number two scoring option on most nights for whatever team he goes to he's going to be the fourth or fifth scoring option he's gonna revert back to Jeremy Grant OKC days rather than what we've seen with Portland OR Detroit in recent years I mean Grant has  I the my math on this is not exact but this appears to be 120 million guaranteed over the next four years  hard contract the trade even harder to trade for that guy and be like I want to see 20 minutes on the bench tonight Jeremy it's like I think the Shannon's point though the fantasy advice here is deal Grant before he gets oh yeah next roll is gonna be less important than his current role yeah I mean we I mean I think almost everybody at RotoWire who's been riding MBA has been telling people sell high and Jeremy Grant sell high on Malcolm Brogdon I mean you're Brogden window might may have closed but you never know you never know who's out there who loves Malcolm Brogden now I do want to get I want to get some feedback from you guys on another Portland player and how to handle it shade and sharp coming off the bench now you've got scoot Henderson in the starting lineup and for Anfernee Simmons or Simon sorry is healthy again and starting  how long I think both of those two are going to be locked in the starting lineup for the Trail of Light Blazers for you know the next four or five years how long until they go with a small lineup and get Shane sharp in there I I really think they should be considering starting him at the three his fantasy values taking a bit of a hit with him coming off the bench is there any chance this team goes small or is he just gonna be delegated to the six-man role for the first Super Bowl future  I think there is a chance that goes small but I would mostly just be like if I wanted to get sharp or I had sharp on my roster I was thinking about do I drop this guy  depends on your family goes into like March because this could just they could just be tanking again like you know late March comes around they just sit all their fats and then Sharp's playing 39 minutes a game and seeing increased usage because the thing is even if they do go small sharp is not that good as like when he's surrounded by a bunch of other starting caliber players he's mostly just a score in those situations which isn't amazing for Fantasy other than points leaks which you know can be good  well they're clearly looking at timani Kamara is kind of a 3D future guy defensive help because the other starters don't play good D there either right so  if you go all know defense that could get ugly fast I don't know Sharp's pretty young still loses confidence against backups  yeah um five  yeah it's I mean we have so much these situations in the MBA where it's like well when middle of March comes around we have literally no idea what's going to happen that includes with Shannon's Pistons to be honest we have a day game yesterday in Perry Cavs versus Nets Cavs win on 111 to 102 Catherine up 20 at the half I think Mitchell went to win for 45 it was yeah it's really messed up like fantasy lineups guys have one game weeks the whole thing it's just it's sucks for Fantasy but and they should just sent one man Yama out there I don't know why yeah are the are people in Paris like man I really need to see cam jump Johnson and Camp Thomas and  oh man Isaac a coral finally I've been waiting my whole life I assume they scheduled this before the NBA draft even occurred before they you know but but Wendy was known I must have scheduled it before the lottery right because yeah  you know you know how they do this thing now where  like when the Celtics were in Indiana they scheduled it for them to play both their Indiana games on that trip to minimize travel it seems weird that if you're gonna commit to Paris why not have two game two teams go and play two games there right like one game in a week for each team to Bizarro  because weird it is weird we also had Max Drews he heard his right knee just deemed as soreness only played Seven Minutes in that game obviously he's got some time to rest since the the next game is Monday I don't know I mean we've seen a lot of these calves and that's teams are kind of interesting we've seen the Nets well I'll talk about a guy in the Nets later but we had you know Kim Thomas had a big game in the in this one but they're rotation is kind of all over the place we also have the Cavs it's like Spruce it's hot and he's cold it's these teams are targeted predict them they should be we're getting another microphone complaint in the comments by the way  we need you to be I mean look I don't think the new microphone this  your microphone does not represent the level of influencer that you are can I think we need to hey sports betting legal in Vermont you should you should place a bet make some money and then spend it on a new microphone reinvest reinvest into the production of the podcast  okay before before we get to some other fan feedback I do want to talk about Underdog fantasy Underdog

and deposit bonus  that's our WNBA all right that's not good  I'm trying let's time for our fan feedback we're gonna start from Mr muluk I'm hoping I'm not mispronouncing that your thoughts on Kenard and Tilghman going forward rest of season from Memphis Grizzlies we're gonna touch a little on that in our waiver wire segment I suggest some Grizzlies the gentleman your thoughts on Kenard and Tilghman  I mean canard's he's just a specialist he's a three-point guy I think you'll play decent minutes because you know he has to because the the Grizzlies just have a ton of men it's out there so if you need threes if you're on air category League sure roster Kennard see what happens and Tillman  he's been so up and down but they they got to be on both they waved him so they could sign Vince Williams so if you are I think if you are a Talman believer in any sense pick him up and see what happens because he does have potential to get you some double doubles or close to most nights if you can take these to play 28 to 30 minutes ago yeah I'm basically gonna just reiterate what what Alex said there I mean with Tillman you've got bizmax gone so they're gonna give him a chance aldama is currently out Brandon Clark still out Steven Adams out for the season so yeah they haven't liked what they've seen from Jaron Jackson at the five so I expect him to get a little bit of a longer leash this time around and have and we stick in the starting lineup and try to prove his value in the short term with Cunard he'll probably be locked in as the starting shooting guard now he started two straight games with Marcus Smart Derek Rose and of course John Moran all out I mean I went this team's gonna get have to do something interesting in the back or I want to be surprised if they basically just have you know keep Vince Williams and starting lineup at the three and and basically have been the official point guard with Kennard at the two but Kennard his main value we've seen it when he was with the Pistons when he was with the  Clippers Memphis is three-pointers so outside of three pointers and some scoring he's not gonna offer much and then one more question from free key it's a little lengthy in the comments so I'm not going to show up but basically wants to know the center situation in Chicago with Lucifer back and Drummond what are your thoughts on drumming and boost I mean it seems like vouchers back he played 40 minutes and started the other night against Houston went for 18 15 and 3 drumming didn't like six or seven minutes right I don't even know German had a rebound in that game  yes zero boards in 12 minutes I mean okay part of me wants to say if you don't if there's nobody on the waiver wire that you love you can hang on to Drummond because who knows I mean much of itchy was a growing injury he's old he could pull it again you just never know but I think if you're asking me like is it over in theory I think it is over for Drummond  German average basically six points and six point six point two point six point eight rebounds per game coming off the bench prior to voucher which is injury so if you just healthy I just don't think there's many leads where that's gonna hold value maybe 14 deep 14 teams where Drummonds playing 14 minutes and his six and six or seven and seven but I wouldn't expect more than that so if that doesn't hold water in your league then cut him loose  okay if I offer fan feedback Ken yes sir let's go to the waiver wire as always with the waiver wire section of this podcast we each suggest two regular picks and one long shot regular picks roster and 50% or fewer of standard of just fantasy but usually Yahoo and one long shot 25% or fewer of Lee's I actually have almost three long shot today I'll touch on that we should note for games this upcoming week Milwaukee and Sacramento with only two games so be careful picking guys off from those squads and all so if you're streaming guys from those squads  get rid of them go ahead sorry no I was gonna say we were going to say half the teams have four games so decent streaming opportunities this week for serves a lot of guys I mean kick things off  mobile Wagner Orlando Magic 29% rostered his brother France says missed the past three games he will all be out Fridays well good chance he's being out of him being out Saturday as well he was ruled out basically a day in advance of Friday the back to back again don't be surprised past three games for Mo 18 points on 12 shotts nine boards two assists two steals in 30 minutes magic at four games next week great streaming opportunity better pick up if you are a daily lineups League daily transactions League because we don't know about Franz for next week so keep that in mind when picking up Mo if you are in a like Sunday waiver League like a lot of us are  yeah my husband doing well they don't seem to really want to give monster minutes to go gun fortunately  I wish yeah um but cats speaking of Dreams coming true though guess who's back gentlemen that cockroach TJ McConnell of your Indiana Pacers he is rostered in 54% of leagues people been scooping them up the last few days he's our cover guy for this weeks video Pacers have four games next week but more importantly unfortunately Tyreese Halliburton is out for at least two weeks and you know they're starting Andrew neb hard but he's not the guy the cockroach is the better point guard and this fast-paced offense needs a real floor General  look McConnell her 36 this season is averaging a double-double 18 points over 11 and a half assists over six rebounds and this is huge 2.3 steals per 36 minutes McConnell's always been a great steal guy you know a 31 years of age he still has lots of gas in the tank what I want to start them all year nobody I think he's gonna be awesome these two weeks Pacers have four games he's a dream streamer this week McConnell  oh ken if you're sharing if you're trying to talk you're muted  great suggestion Ken we all know how much you love the Cockroach and he is fun to watch play so I'm excited to see what he can do for the Pacers my know yeah that was always gonna come back my first waiver wire suggestion of the week is a big man out in Portland do op Reef we've talked about him a few weeks ago but he's back kind of up on the upswing he's played four straight games started four straight games for the Portland Trail Blazers at Center over those four games he has averaged 281.5% from the floor only 57% from the line which is tough to manage but that's that's on less than two attempts per game and surprisingly I don't think many have noticed this he also averages one point one and a half three pointers for game over that stretch so he is chucking from downtown and he is a stretch five six eleven 250 pounds do our briefs widely available rostered in 28% of leagues and we don't know what's going on with the Andre 8 and right now you know he is he is missed double-digit games in a row there doesn't appear to be a yeah any update about him practicing or nearing a return so right now I think do I briefed is a good streaming option if you need big man stats and I already know nothing for Aid in the play for no reason back Alex do you have any insights on the DeAndre ayton injury he probably got followed and that's it that's all it takes for Aiden to be down for a long time no I am the doo wop under last night but I do I do like I do like that suggesting he is he's averaging a fancy Point per minute so if he starting an averaging a fancy Point per minute he's roster Bull and almost I see I do have an update on 8 and actually they overnight there was news he might return for Friday's game against Minnesota so keep that in mind and I will have I have a special recommendation I've replaced placement for doop brief since we can't we can't suggest him in good faith knowing that that eight might not might come back I'm gonna go with Cam Whitmore he's a long shot but I don't care I want him on my roster right now cam Whitmore is coming off a game where he played 33 minutes off the bench 16 points five rebounds one assist two steals he can hit threes he can get big defensive stats  right now Dillon Brooks is weak to week Eason is weak to week this team is starting Json Tate at the small forward position Json Tate is miserable he is he cannot help with the fancy on the fancy side I possibly as soon as the Rockets game the next game that Whitmore gets more minutes or even starts so I would proactively scooped him up and stash him hoping that he does see 25 plus minutes and in the near future Canada to close this closet door apologies to anybody who heard that scraping it's kind of a Memento situation there's actually a guy in there it was crazy  no Whitmore is a Whitmore is a great fantasy pickup right now I mean you sharing you mentioned it Eastern and Brooks are out so whitmore's getting more minutes but  26% usage rate for Whitmore 1.1 fantasy points per minute obviously guys looked in the draft to 20th but has more Talent than that someone who  even if you're in a 12 team League I think you gotta look  let's move on I'm gonna move on to my second fantasy pick up which is technically a long shot Chris Dunn of the Utah Jazz who was only 11% rostered don't look now folks the Jazz are 12 and 4 since December 13th one of the hottest teams in the NBA right now passed 11 games for done pretty big sample these are all starts Five Points on five shots yes this is horrible he is destroying your field goal percentage but six and a half assists 3.9 rebounds 1.5 steals 1.0 blocks in those starts and only 1.1 turnovers if you play Nyan Cat leaks Jazz have four games next week they're running hot done is playing well this is a great situation to get potentially you know you could you could get I don't know you know 24 assists and you know who even knows man like 12 combined Steals and blocks into your line up this week with Dawn  who's giving a major minutes  uh Ken  take us to Memphis yeah we talked earlier in the show a lot of injuries in Memphis I'm going with newly signed Vince Williams Junior the rookie wing for the Memphis Grizzlies six foot six second round pick look Marcus Smart is out for at least six weeks we know Jaws out for the season um he started and played 30 minutes in that Wednesday blowout surprise win at Dallas Memphis just gave him a three-year contract to bump him off his two-way deal and they cut bismack biombo to make room for Mr Williams in eight starts he's averaged 6.6 points 7.4 rebounds 1.3 steals half a block and over one and a half triples so some unusual stat production but I think they're committed to Williams and he's going to start for a while  because they're planning the youngsters  and they realize what John out miles will develop guys and I think they see of Vince Williams is a diamond in the rough long we mentioned earlier they dropped they waved I keep saying dropped like it's a fantasy team they waved bismack biyombo so they could sign Vince Williams to a three-year deal so that tells you how much they they believe in him he's a fairly low usage player look at the same time very good rebounder can pass pretty well a good IQ on the floor knows how to move the ball solid defensive numbers as well so if you're like a points situation like certainly grab Williams because he could be playing 30 plus minutes for for the foreseeable future  Shannon take us to your next waiver wire claim go I'm going to Golden State  yeah we've discussed this rookie already this season but trayce Jackson Davis rookie big man for the Golden State Warriors He's been in and out starting lineup somewhat inconsistent but it's hard to argue with the results over the past week he is a top 40 fantasy player he is rostered about 35% of leagues in those three games in the past week 24 minutes one start two games coming off the bench 15.3 points 8.3 rebounds 1.7 blocks and he's shooting a whopping 88% from the floor you know it's gonna get murky you we don't know from game to game whether he's going to be in the starting lineup some games he'll start and then not start second half or not start the first half start the second half Draymond Green is returning soon that's gonna Mark that that's going to make things even murkier but I love the challenge here I love the production and I think there's getting I think he's going to stick in the Warrior's front Court rotation moving forward get those 20 to 25 minutes and even with that like I said over the past week he's still a top 40 fantasy player while playing 24 minutes per game I do think we're going to see  Kevon Looney kind of a phased out of the out of the rotation once dream on returns but we'll see I I'm holding or stashing tjd if he's available in a 12 or 14 Team league you're Looney take is interesting I I have tjd in a lot of League's worried about greens return but you think they're going to phase all Looney who else  exactly yeah I mean I I mean they could do Wiggins but that that would mess up their floor spacing so badly it might be an issue but yeah I mean  I look yeah it's it's tough to say because Kerr is so he I think he might be in love with come on though need to be honest he just like won't stop playing him but the thing is tjd like gives them the athleticism that they're lacking at Center great for for lobs can block shots at The Rim a lot better so it's an interesting situation to Monitor and you know the like Shannon said TJ's been so good and the in the worries have been so middling that why not give the young kid a shot right  okay my next pick which is also technically a long shot pick Dennis Smith Jr of the Brooklyn Nets 19% rostered and that's with four games so certainly a streaming option even in shallower like 12 teams past ten games for Dennis Smith Jr 7.9 points 5.2 assists 3.7 rebounds 1.1 steals in 22 minutes kind of stealing some minutes from Spencer Dinwiddie here and there the magnets can fluctuate but he is a solid source of assistance deals again other than I just mentioned Don but how many guys are really on the waiver wire that you can grab and they might give you I mean they should give you about 20 assists and four steals just not a lot of those guys out there and Smith is has been one of those guys we saw it last year with Charlotte he played well when he started when the Mellow was out so I think he can continue to to make an impact of the rotation  Ken who is your next pickup uh for my long shot I'm going with Xavier Tillman senior of the Memphis Grizzlies also mentioned earlier in the show I know he looks 50 years old but he's only 25 out of Michigan State and as we said Memphis caught bismack biyombo when they signed two-way guy Vince Williams so that means Tillman is really the only true Center on this roster because remember Steven Adams is out for the year one caveat is a terrible free throw shooter but he takes one attempt for game so we really shouldn't affect you her 36 Tillman over 10 points almost nine rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game Memphis is with only three games next week not ideal but I feel like I'm in a lot of League from perpetually hunting for a backup  third Century if you will on I think Tillman's going to fill that role nicely for the rest of the year again he is the only true Center on this Memphis roster  yeah we talked about my bed early has been weirdly unreliable but he was hurt and then they brought him biyombo and but I'll be on both gone so I think I think we can start to trust Tillman a little bit again who has proven throughout his career like if you give them the 30 minutes he can get you you know 12 and 8 every single night with a block maybe block and a half thrown on it um okay Shannon do you have one more for us yes my long shot of the week Sam Merrill for the Cleveland Cavaliers he's already had some games DFS players are definitely familiar with him he's had some big games coming off the bench and spot starts Max druce left Thursday's game early after playing just seven minutes and as a result Sam Merrill saw a lot of extra playing time he ended up with 32 minutes just six points nine rebounds one assist one steal it was only two for 12 from the floor two free 11 from downtown but that kind of shows you what volume we're talking about I mean Sam Merrill previous previous three games had nine nine and nine three-point attempts as well he is firing from downtown so he's a guy kind of like Luke Kennard if you need three pointers we're not sure the extent of mixtures injury yet so keep an eye on that but I would say you know as a  if you want to just kind of  pick up a three-point streamer right now Meryl should see or could see extra minutes in the short term Gary Scarlett of course is also still out for the Cavs so I like Meryl as a short-term plug-in for for any 3-point help yep pretty much he was drafted by the Box former Buck I've seen him play a decent amount they just let him go because he ironically because he wasn't doing anything but drilling threes from Milwaukee so if that's what you need on your fantasy team and he's getting minutes  pick him up  okay that concludes our waiver wire section A lot of long shots this week oh shots maybe it's time for me to talk

Indiana crazy over under 251 and a half you've got ton of ton of exciting options on both sides even with Halliburton now to johnte Murray Trey young Jalen Johnson is just been crushing it for Atlanta I expect him to have another big game tonight and then for Indiana with Helen out you've got we've talked about it TJ McConnell he's a great streaming option and he's also a great DFS play for tonight

start playing for huge cash prizes today let's talk about Friday's daily fantasy slate 10 games today on the NBA highest over under Indiana Atlanta who could have guessed that this over under would be 250 250 two and a half actually um as always for injury news and lineup notes you can visit Road a while you're calm and also the daily log of space specifically which is which is awesome Shannon you mentioned it you are looking at this at Atlanta Indiana game again a high total it's hard to say you know how much Indiana is going to be able to keep up offensively without Halliburton but obviously opens up value for Connell and nem hard and then they're going to be just as bad defensively so I think a lot of people are going to fill in not just the stars from this lineup but probably role players from this game too just to take advantage of the overall under yeah absolutely and right now I mean on FanDuel I think some of the role players are better price on FanDuel where on DraftKings you got some of the the star options like Jalen Johnson he's 7200 on DraftKings 79 on FanDuel I like them at either price for either platform but obviously like quite a bit more at the 7200 that he is at DraftKings Deontay Murray's another guy he's 7200 on DraftKings that's hard for me to avoid meanwhile his 8200 on the on FanDuel that's a little bit tougher I think he's I want to watch and see his Trey young in a play he is listed as probable but the shoulder injury obviously Murray gets a significant boost if Young's out  we also have your pistons on the Slate and they're going up against the Rockets Pistons are seven and a half Point dogs at home looks like Isaiah Stewart's back Bogdan bogdanovich also listed on the injury report as probable they got smoked by the Spurs the other night game the absolutely loved the Spurs that I come and believe the spur was only three and a half is there I mean can you give us any insights about what is going on with the Pistons without Cade Cunningham I mean it's it's nothing too exciting to watch you know their the Jade and Ivy is getting more of an opportunity to leave the offense Killian Hayes is back in the starting lineup but it's it's a miserable even more miserable experience than normal but but good news just as fans Isaiah Stewart beef stew is expected to return for Friday night's slate that that actually causes quite the disruption in your DFS planning because I've watched 90% of the Pistons games this year and I have no clue what Monty is going to do with the starting lineup the assumption is he takes livers out and plugs Isaiah Stewart back in but we'll see he could go completely through you know take a total curve ball and do some new starting lineup combination that he hasn't used yet this year I am not big on plugging in Isaiah Stewart he's 5100 on FanDuel I don't think he's much of a DFS option really out on the Piston side of that contest I don't like much outside of killing Hayes he's at 6000 if for some reason as far as our tops and does get plugged into the starting lineup which is very very unlikely he is only 3600 on DraftKings and would be a very interesting play but since we don't know if he's going to play eight minutes or 18 or 28 it's tough to put much faith in us are providing a  fantasy a productive fantasy line for tonight but on the rocket side I really really liked the rocket side for tonight's late the biggest question mark is going to be will it you know is it going to be a blowout but you've got Fred Van Fleet is 7,900 on DraftKings there are very few players averaging 40 fantasy points per game that are under 8,000 dollars he might be you know only one and he's also coming off back-to-back 50 plus Point fancy Point outings I'm gonna be it's gonna be tough for me to remove Fred Van Fleet from my starting lineup and then cam Whitmore who I mentioned earlier he's a bit too expensive for my taste on FanDuel about 4900 4300 on DraftKings so and like I said I expect Whitmore to play more if not get a sturdy not tonight  I kind of like Jabari Smith in that game too played at least 40 minutes and two of the past three games might might be checked by his Stewart tonight so that's a provides good opportunity and we have Sacramento Philly and beat his out I think this is a solid so bonus spot if you're Paul Reed guy go for it to buy his Harrison a solid spot as well Maxi we kind of know the story there I will say someone I'm fading on tonight's late Steph Curry I'm out give me the under 27 and a half I'm out I took the under him he scored 15 points the other day against the Pelicans Bulls are wearing the best teams the NBA and guarding point guards especially point guards who are running pick and roll  Steph Curry's running more pick and roll than ever with with Chris Paul out what person in the NBA do you need to focus on one guy right now to stop more to just shut down an entire team completely then Steph Curry on the warrior so I am I'm just out on Steph Curry in the game Bulls are actually favored by three at home that's all so pretty slow place to play so they'll be possessions right so  you got it  where else are you turning tonight Shannon  yeah I mean on that golden station Chicago side I actually I like Zach LaVine quite a bit 7400 on DraftKings his minutes limit has been on Captain so he played 41 minutes against the Rockets had 61 fantasy points he still had a decent pretty affordable salary for tonight's late and then the last mention be they expand Tillman we've discussed him multiple times he's 5200 on DraftKings and I expect him to play you know 28 plus minutes and yep yep starting big man so I he's he's hard to 50200 here we also have Orlando Miami matchup Tyler hero questionable for that one so that could be a source of value depending on what happens there  Portland Minnesota  look man God bless you if you if you play any buggy from this game Minnesota is 15 and a half Point favorites at home after Portland just got blown out by 60 and they're on the second night with back to back this could be this could be a place where you just grab somebody off like the benches of these teams if you you know if you have 4,000 dollars left over and you know like you know what this could be a blowout let's grab someone off the bench here Charlotte San Antonio we have lamelo ball questionable so keep an eye on that we all have Kayla Martin PJ Washington I suppose Frankel he knows all so questionable for this game I think this could be a decent spot for one but Yaba anything from those games or the other three that we haven't discussed yet sharing catching your eye  well not from those three games specifically you'd mentioned the Philly gamer earlier I do like the Philly side with indeed out you know Tobias Harris just coming off a gigantic Amy at 54 fantasy points he had he had a 50 point out he earlier this year while while on beat set as well so 7200 he's one of those guys I really think they're a lot of guys in that 7,000 range who can pop off for 50 fantasy points tonight into buyers one of them I think I think that is time then for us to move on to Ken's old man rant  Tristan Thompson of the Cleveland Cavaliers  Mick Clarkston thinks he's all that with an alley-oop dunk despite the net still being down 10 points and generally getting whooped all game by the Cavs over there in Perry so Thompson after Claxton kind of obnoxiously celebrates his dunk Thompson walks straight into clocks in on his way to the Cavs bench which was delicious this somehow knocked clocks in down there was no punch there was no shove Thompson just walked into him with 254 pounds of old school NBA I hate it when players kissing hug post game they're supposed to hate each other in the 90s the Bulls and pistons tried to kill each other there was a Coke fuel brawl every week in the 80s it was glorious bring back the NBA brawls  oh you're gonna say bring back cocaine to the NBA I think we we have like any mispronounced names in this podcast today uh there were a lot of Smiths and duns and Williams and Tillmans  makes things a bit easier that does it everybody for our RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast thank you to our fans and the sponsors Underdog fantasy and FanDuel can take us out here with a quote yeah let's go to Los Angeles where Raptors coach Darko Roger kovich reached there goes there goes the mispronounced names I started reactivate sorry anyway Darkrai ackovitz reacted Tuesday night the new coach of the Raptors reacted Tuesday night to the Lakers getting 23 free throws in the fourth quarter when the Raptors got just two it's outrageous we what happened tonight this is completely BS this is shame shameful referees shame for the league to allow this 23 free throws for them and we got two free throws in the fourth quarter like how to play the game I understand respect for all stars and all that but we have started players on our team as well how is it possible that Scotty Barnes who is All Star gullible player in this league he goes every single time to the room with floors and trying to get to him without flopping and not trying to get fouls he gets two free throws for a whole game how is that possible how are you going to explain that to me that is a direct quote by the way those exact words he used I tried to do his accents I probably didn't you little way too much Adolf yeah NBA fine Darko 25,000 for this ESPN has the clip online if you don't believe my accent I I did I did adjust I think but anyway oh Darko you are a thousand percent correct Charles Barkley said 100% correct uh love the quote and I'm agree with the 1000 percent love it Darko attention passengers this three-car fantasy train wreck has hit the end of the line  new microphone next week
