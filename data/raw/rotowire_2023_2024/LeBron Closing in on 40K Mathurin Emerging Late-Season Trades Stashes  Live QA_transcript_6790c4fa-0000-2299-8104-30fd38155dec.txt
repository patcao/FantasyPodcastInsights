hey everybody I'm Steve Alexander Dr a welcome to the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast it's Thursday February 29th LeBron is approaching 40,000 points that's Rick kamla the OG and this is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast what's up everybody it is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast with fswa Hall of Famer Steve Alexander I'm Rick kamla as he said we're the ogs man and we are here to give you fantasy advice that is going to help you down the stretch run the playoffs are either coming up next week and some League's like 30 deep in the cam Dynasty two weeks out from this week and so we're approaching a very critical point of the Season man um and so doc let's dive in as you mentioned with LeBron James here when will he hit 40,000 points before we get to that we just for a second half too I mean I you're a night owl I'm a night owl I was up late watching that game last night and the Lakers early in the fourth quarter were dead flat lifeless hopeless down 21 with the black on the court of the LA Clippers and and I'm like LeBron took one shot in the third quarter I'm like what is up it's like is he not up to this anymore and you're having all of these thoughts right and then all the 21st season the stuff just doesn't make sense Steve you're not supposed to be able to do this Jimmy Butler is in his  3334 35 range right and he Big Boy Milwaukee in the first round last year in the playoffs I as I say he Butler them okay he just pushed a button became a superhero and be honest LeBron did that last night LeBron Butler the Clippers dude so before we talk about 40K man what the hell did we just watch last night  well I want Max screws destroyed my Mavericks tonight before with five three-pointers in five minutes including one from half court it was heartbreaking loss for Dallas she's you know they're trying to win their division they're trying to sneak past the Pelicans they're trying to get up there into a top four spot in the west which is going to be tough to do but they they can easily be number five so that was devastated and then last night not that I had any stake in it but like you said LeBron flipped a switch his start just banging three-pointer after three-pointer in the fourth quarter he really couldn't miss his whole Swagger changed his whole demeanor changed he's talking to the crowd he was like I think he was 13 pointer away from a Jordan shrug out he did have the tongue out good point dude it was closed and and I think that that hired his teammates as well because I feel like Austin Reeves was more active after that the Angela Russell made some shots and  it was cool to watch man I mean dude dudes 40 years old he's out there just able to to do that and it orchestrated 21 Point comeback win to boot and now you know you look at the bottom of the Western Conference standings it's Golden State and it's the Lakers I mean those are the two teams that are  they've they've passed everybody else they're going to be at least in the play in if not the actual playoffs so  the picture is a lot brighter for both of those teams than it was a month or two ago there's no doubt dude there's no doubt so how far is she away from 40K let's try to pinpoint this for well he was he was 74 before last night  so he's 40 away oh you've got it my bad  carry on dude it's so good tell him so he do some math so do you what do you think LeBron's playing tonight at home against Washington that's the thing man I don't know  I can tell you right now he ain't playing tonight you don't think so no no well I was on the radio on Tuesday and they asked me this question because they're all betting on it and I said well he's three games away so the next three the third game he plays from today will be the day that he hits it so I said I don't think he's gonna play against Washington  so I think Monday is the day against Oklahoma City and they're like all right that's what we're rolling with but then after last night  and like man but why would he why would why would he play against Washington tonight Rick that's that's the question  he's not going to we already have a pattern and a model for this they had a three-game in fortnite stretch right out of the All-Star break and he annoyingly sat the Golden State game came back the next night against San Antonio and a game that they could have won without him and they won that game and then he played Sunday I think that was against Phoenix um so that was a three out of four  in LeBron played two out of the four  I mean  teams are reluctant to play their star players in a three game in a fortnite set if they're 25 years old if you're 30 nine it's like it's a red flag like they're not going to do it I would be shocked if LeBron James played tonight like shocked so to me he's not going to play tonight they're going to tell rui and Ruiz and Russell and Anthony Davis and I think Anthony I mean oh my God no more Gafford with Washington Anthony Davis might have 50 points tonight okay they're gonna be fine why I mean oh my God just quickly here Jordan Poole has to catch a strike  dude  and  at home against Golden State the other night  the league back 10 years okay like that was it bro he's barking at the refs getting attack leaving Chris Paul Buck Naked wide open for three balls low dude this is your old team whereas the get back Factor anyway he had to catch a stray I had to get that off my chest so I don't think Brian is playing tonight doc Saturday um it's a showcase game against the Denver Nuggets and is he going for 40 no I'm not even sure LeBron's got 40 points in him in a regulation game anymore okay so it's going to be Monday night against the Oklahoma City Thunder and I don't know doc when the what the betting odds are in that and and you know if you kind of I guess maybe there's a money making opportunity with this Washington dnp we're talking about right like is the whole world hip to this just does most people think that LeBron's going to play tonight because I think they're going to be very very disappointed doc  yeah I I just the only thing that scares me is there is a lot of money on the line in Vegas on this there is a lot of hype around Lebron after that game last night and where is that game is it at wash it's at Washington right no no it's a home game it's it's in La okay yeah um so the fans in La get to see LeBron play every night so there's not like gonna be any pressure to make sure that this Dad spent 5,000 dollars for his kids see LeBron play  in the front row in Washington is not gonna lose all that money but um  yeah I mean I  it'll be surprising if LeBron plays but I don't like the fact he's not already on the injury report it's like they're they're just it's too early for anything to be out there why we do this show in the morning is beyond me Rick like next year we're going to rework our contract we're gonna do this more in our wheelhouse of something after noon when we're actually awake but dude why we're talking about Washington real quickly and just because it's not in our notes have you noticed what tyus Jones has been doing  I have he's been amazing  14 and 17 in his last game three and 11 before that five and six before that and then 13 and 14 14 and 15 14 and 16 25 and 9 17 and nine like just a double double  losing machine is what that is I mean it's so funny to pull up Washington's  players game logs and just it's just one L after another and it's doesn't matter how good the numbers are it's always an L it's always bad but when is tyus Jones going to be shut down  I mean I hope he doesn't get shut down why would you shut him down there's no wimpy in this draft you have fans who are coming out to your Arena to watch your team play I mean why are we going with the capital city go go right or the Memphis hustle I think it's garbage now what I want what teams want is different um I don't know maybe they don't shut him down um obviously and I had this thought about what's on sale Junior God bless him like he was not unleashing tyus Jones the minutes were down the shot attempts were down it's like he had a bridal on him and now obviously Ty's Jones is on leash and we're seeing what's up you know Washington didn't trade him doc he was one of the top guys rumored to be out he's in an expiring contract he'll be a free agent this off season he will be coveted so he's in a push right now and I'm not sure if Washington is grooming him to be their starter next year again or if he's grooming himself for free agency but I don't know doc I don't know this might be a different year with shutdowns now there I you talk hey Doc they've already started it bro you got Hendricks out there you got sense about their keonte George is starting and so I already smell the market and Clarkson shut down and all this kind of stuff I hope it doesn't happen but I don't think San Antonio was going to shut down when be back screw Henderson's already hurts I don't know what the hell's going on with that  Portland's probably gonna shut their main dudes down eight and just picked up an injury right Walker Kessler as a foot sprain  I mean so you know how that goes man that might be it I mean we're at February 29th right now so we have six weeks left in the regular season um but I don't know doc I don't know about Washington I don't they already suck they completely and totally suck even with kuzma Rowland and Taya Stone's rolling in your boy in they still lose every damn game so why shot him down well and whereas Deni avdija he's been gone for three games so  I tell you what my my 30 team is having a bit of  a wake-up call this week no dear and fox Kobe  Kobe white suddenly doesn't look as good as he did last week I'm getting a little nervous I mean my guys to play all right let's get back on schedule here and LeBron I think you and I both agree LeBron is probably going to break the record on Monday against OKC  so you let me ask you a question here  am I supposed I need your help on this stock and everybody out there with the Comets it's the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Hall of Famers Steve Alexander I'm Rick Campbell how much supposed to feel about the 40,000 Milestone doc I'm a stack guy I'm a historian you're a stack guy you're a historian I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this I know that you know when step he's the first to hit 305 100 threes I'm like I don't care he already has the most freeze ever he is the greatest shooter of all time I don't care I don't when Steph makes us 4,003 I'm not gonna care but this is 40,000 points there was once a time doc where Kareem's 38 387 was in stone and nobody was catching that right and now LeBron obviously has and so now we're kind of tracking down 40,000 points I'm not really feeling it dude I'm not this isn't tell me how I'm supposed to feel about this milestone  you're not supposed to feel anyway about it and honestly had I not been on ESPN Panama City Beach radio on Tuesday and those dudes my boy Ryan Mulvey had he not asked me when is LeBron going to hit 40,000 I wouldn't have even known that that was coming because I don't care the game  as we know it right now is so ridiculously  slanted 70% to offensive players and 30% defensive players  that it's just different Larry Bird was shooting what 73 pointers a year Steph Curry shoots 73 pointers a week it's different it's a different game LeBron like all everything is so screwed skewered so  here we go see this is the problem with being on the air before noon I can't come up with words that I could normally come up with plus I'm like 95 years old but it's so skewered towards the offensive player that it's just not that big of a deal to me I don't you know if you didn't tell me it was happening I wouldn't I wouldn't notice or care  okay so I'm glad to hear you say that because I'm like  am I supposed to be more geeked about this because I'm really not that geeked about it um but we think Monday for those of you that are going to bet on this so let's talk Luca in MVP doc what I and Rick that's really the reason I brought it up is because I do think people are betting on it and I think  there are it's a totally different generation of people watching basketball like Ark our boys our kids probably care oh my brother's gonna score 40,000 or you know some 20 three year old kid making 75,000 hours a year yeah oh man I got a chance to make some money here I'm gonna I'm gonna pick the date the LeBron it's 40,000 so I think people care for different reasons yeah I agree with you man I agree with you we'll be taking your comments sharing a little bit guys on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Rick kamla and Hall of Famer Steve Alexander we are the ogs so Luke could not try to triple double on his 25th birthday and they got to win up at Toronto last night so doc was pumping his fist bought another win for his Mavericks even though he's Behind Enemy Lines in Atlanta and used to be a cacao fan but I've obviously he's big Luke a guy you see the Jersey behind him doc my MPP stacking right now goes SGA number one um he's having a Michael Jordan season with the steals with the 3166 with the efficiency with the record Nicole yokich just unbelievable um 26 12 9.3 assists great record um you know can't help but have a triple double right now recently had the only three straight sequence with 14 rebounds and 14 to 6 I could go on three for me Doc is Tatum and Tatum and Luca is a great debate within the debate I don't think they're at the top of the debate but I do think that they're in the debate and it's the wins versus stats Boston is 12 and a half games better than Dallas and that to me is the most important stat of all here Tatum is a 27 and 5 career high in assists career high in efficiency 4736.82 is it an effective field goal percentage of 553 best of his career career highness turnovers are down in a big way and then you got Lucas at 349 and 10 he's going to win his first scoring title but again Dallas is 12 and a half games worse than Boston in it and that's to me is the the trump card here for Tatum versus Luca um and then number five I got Jana stock so how do you stack nbp and where do you have Luca  well I mean I've got the same order my question is are the are the voters going to get it right because  we see some weird stuff happening happening in MVP voting SGA is hands down the favorite right now like he his numbers and the fact that Oklahoma City is very good he should win it but to enough experienced writers agree with that I don't know I mean I just get yogic is going to get a lot of Oats Tatum being all Celtics team that that's good is going to get a lot of votes I think Luca putting up these mind-boggling stat lines every night he's gonna get a lot of oats and you know the telecasters for Dallas last night were like hey follow well or whatever the dude's name is like oh yeah Luca had a 44 45 Point triple double the other night and Derek Harper was like wait a minute dude you just said that like it was normal like he had a 45 Point triple double like that doesn't happen like this is this is we are seeing someone play at a level and having fun playing at that level that we have not seen in a long time and to be honest if Boston was not 12 and a half games better than Dallas something would be wrong because Dallas is out there living around with Kyrie for half the season and Luca carrying  what should be a pretty bad team on his back and we did add gas for we did add PJ Washington and want to say we I'm talking about Dallas not not me and my guys but they added two big men that are making them better Gafford and Derek Lively and pjw all played well last night now Kyrie's fully on board Kyrie's diving on the floor and and making plays that you would not expect the guy like Kyrie to be making the stage of his career and everybody's on board with this this thing and I just feel like by the time the end of the season gets here if Luca keeps doing  this crazy stuff every night the league is going to take notice and if they get up to 5th or even I don't know how they do it but if they can get the fourth in the west I still think Luca  has a shot at winning this thing but I think this is one more interesting MVP races we've had and that there's four or five guys that are all gonna get some votes  I agree you mentioned you know weird stuff is happening um and I don't know man well the weird stuff that could happen here I'm starting to feel a swell a narrative swell for Jayson Tatum best player on best team Damon Jones joined the show on NBA radio with me and Antonio Daniels a couple of days ago I know that a lot of the the talking heads are starting to talk about this and starting to look more adjacent Tatum for MVP just playing the best player best team card which a lot of times historically has been good enough for MVP but we're in a major stat crazy era and Tatum does not have major stat major crazy stats okay they're very very good obviously um  so the weird stuff to me Doc would be SGA continues what he's doing yoga continues what he's doing and all of a sudden we get this like  this big push like a tsunami wave of a push for Tatum frame BP because you remember yolk is kind of had MVP last year and then all of a sudden people are like a hell no I'm not voting for him again beads my guy not just took off and racing through the conversation and all that stupid stuff like um you know and so that was weird stuff last year um now the well the voters get it right doc I don't think so I think you could just gonna win this dude I do sga's my guy like I said I think he should win MVP this year you could just clearly very close on DraftKings right now yokich is at -145 Shea is a distant plus 230 and I do like Shea plus 230 a lot I also like yoga Jim - 145 I would say at this point he's likely to win it and you're only giving up a little bit of juice there doc that's not bad um I would play both of those and just play it out kind of hedging and see what's up so I think one of those two guys are going to win this award doc um  but in the last straw poll that ESPN did with Tim bontemps which is huge because he literally pulls the voters and so it's like a real time leaderboard of MVP and you'll get was the guy okay and so what has SGA done and will do well with the next I don't know four weeks until he does that straw poll again to maybe get people voting for SGA over yokich I don't know right I mean SGA just holds a long doc basically same stat line every night they went every night so what is he going to do to overtake yokich I think yoke which might win this thing dude well and what we saw last year like you were alluding to is people getting on TV  and talking smack and  changing narratives and Swinging votes and swaying elections and you know there's a there's a dude that works that is on TV for the big boys that is going to have a lot of say probably in what happens and we know who he is and I don't think he's gonna be out there pushing real hard for Luca I can see Tatum  I can see the Tatum thing coming through and you know I've been saying all year  honestly like if you're going to vote for MVP if you're going to bet on MVP go with Tatum just cuz he's on the best team and he's the best player on the best team now  I don't know if that narrative works anymore like you said it's a different it's a different world today man it's the stats are different there's younger people voting on this and they're used to be and it's it's gonna be an interesting finish to see who wins MVP all right man it is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Rick kamla and Steve Alexander he's a Hall of Famer we are the ogs is the Ben matheran Spike real or only because Erin E Smith is out of the lineup doc I say it's not real math since the All-Star break his been awesome 20.7 rebounds four assists one and a half deals 3.33 I mean this is a juicy stat line he's making 45% of his shots um in these Smith has missed all four of those games since the All-Star break and when these Smith is healthy you know what Rick carlile's going to do he's going to go screw she's going to go what's my what he's gonna go  I can't think of it but you know kind of like I was character that symbols killed in its escaping me right now um doc I was up late watching Lakers and Clippers but anyway none of that he loves me Smith and when he Smith is healthy he is going to be in that starting lineup  why what does Rick Carlisle C and Andrew nebicard can you please  I feel like cussing right now but I'm not going to could you please explain what the fuck Carlile season Andrew hard to start him over been matheran can you please effing explain this to be because it drives me crazy Rick Carlos my guy but I hate his rotation stock I freaking hate his rotation it's been math should be starting in playing 33 minutes a game every single night without question oh I cannot explain it  I have no answers I don't like it I like math and man and you know I I kind of went all in on math and last night he his yeah his numbers after the breaker good but a lot of them are buoyed by that 11 of 15 shooting game on Monday against the Raptors when he had 34 points 9 boards five assists a block and two Steals and oh oh yeah five triples like that was the game and that game I was like okay  maybe that's turning all of this around and we're going to get Matthew and the rest of the way but then last night gives the Pelicans  six of 17 shooting not very good for triples I was nice 16 points for boys five fouls just more hoe home and really I feel like math and is like one monster game  every two and a half weeks and then it's just sort of mediocrity for two two and a half more weeks and then another explosion and then everybody gets excited but the thing is the numbers you cited at the very beginning of your take since the All-Star break our real and they're good and this guy should be rostered in a heck of a lot more places than he is but why Rick Carlisle loves nem Harding keeps running him out there over math and I am unable to answer that with my feeble little mind  consistent minutes every night as supposed to this yo-yo his play would be more consistent have we considered that Rick Carlisle  all right ball Doc is the ball Bowl Spike real you go first on this one  you know my son's favorite basketball player is bol bol every time Bobo does something so gets so far up I don't know why I don't know where it came from it's probably because I'm on his 2K team or whatever but he's all fired up about bull every time Bulbul shows a pulse which is about twice every NBA season for the last six years right and and it's happening right now we've got what two games two games in a row that we've seen bubble like show up show out I don't have him on my list of guys you need to stash I don't have him on my list of guys you need to run out pick up  its Phoenix  feel like they get bored everyone just want to try something different so this  whole bowl out there and see what happens but it is fun when it happens man because he you get reminded every time it happens how good he is and you watch Victor women Yama play every night and really bull bull is a mini Vic whimby I wish they'd let him play more and but a lot of this as you wrote on our script is because bill has missed four games in a row and other guys are banged up and it's it's kind of Bobo Spike time but  I wish I wish it was real but I don't feel like it is  I'm a Bradley Beal manager in the cam Dynasty much to my chagrin so  I follow all of these Ebbs and flows and it's it's beyond even the sample size that we've had here like other like many spikes for ball they happen when Brad beelz out when Bill is in and when Booker is in and went Durant is in you never hear from bull bull this is a Bradley Beal thing despite his not real okay so high with bull bull if you can't right now because he has a buzz guy in a hype guy um you know and he had the major game of the Laker game 25 and 14 and oozing Oz and going viral came back the next game pretty good not great 11 points four rebounds two blocks um he's going to be a 12 to 15 minute player when all of their guys are healthy and you think about the pecking order doc  you've got you know it Grayson Allen starts and so then the sixth man is Eric Gordon then you have Bulbul in Eubanks right because Eubanks backs up to five Bulbul basically backs up the four and you know Bobo came back up to three or the five as well but there's just not gonna be a ton of minutes for him uh when all of these guys get healthy so enjoy it um I've already sent him back to waivers in the cam Dynasty because I don't know who the hell I picked up but I just don't trust it because I know Beale is going to be coming back here at some point um so doc let me get into a league that I've got and it's not my league I believe Brandon kleis does this league I don't know if you've heard of it it's called Sam hickey's letter um it's a 20 Team league I'm actually surprised you're not in this league it's a bunch a bunch of Industry people um I won this ship a few years back I traded I mean it was a horse oh just a terrible trade for me is it looks now I traded Tyler hero Jaron Jackson Jr and like two years of draft picks for Steph Curry and and I want I've got Trey young and John and sabonis and nurkic and PJ Washington I got a squad but I probably should have kept JJJ and hero for the Long Haul oh well I went with staff I got a ring it's cool but but now Doc um John Moran's out for the year I got Trey young he may be out for the year and so right no John no trade I'm the best team in this league doc by four and a half games number one out of 20 best record in the league looking for my second ship and so I'm screwed like as is I'm screwed I don't have enough I'm putting Dell and Terry in my damn starting lineup okay cuz it's a 20 Team league  so I get a trade-off for doc from a team called Harden in the paint and he wants Bulbul and he wants Jalen sucks now he's tugging at my heartstrings for Jalen sucks because Jalen Suggs is one of the Prime candidate at home he's but you can't fall in love with your players people I tell you this all the time  and Bobo he wants Jalen Suggs and bull bull doc he is offering me and I've already accepted this trade Draymond Green Bobby Portis Mike Conley and Duncan Robinson  and I understand the age would dream on green and Mike Conley I totally get it that is not lost on me this is a dynasty slash keeper League we keep 10 okay  but doc I'm looking for a chip man and I need fortifications and I need depth and so I just picked up dunk and Robinson who's killing it by the way very very quietly very softly my colleague just decided to your extension to come back and do the 10-point six assists one steal two three high efficiency thing okay that works for me Bobby Portis is like 29 or 30 right oh I'm still flirting with double doubles every night dream on green is what 33 but he does he's a he has he's always had old man game I think Draymond Green is gonna age well do the triple single thing I mean he's becoming a good three-point shooter all a mark us all a dream Brook Lopez um you know it short halfway through their career they pivoted and became good three-point Shooters so what do you think of my trade bro I got Draymond Bobby Portis Mike Conley Duncan Robinson for bold and Jalen sucks what do you think of my what I don't trade bro I don't really even understand it because you gave away Jalen sucks he got four guys who can help you right now mean Duncan Robinson had 11 assists the other night right Mike Conley was terrible terribly quiet in his last game and burned me and FanDuel but we've we've talked for weeks on this very podcast about what a good year Mike Conley's having and in a 20 Team league you can't just go out there and find a point guard to pick up and replace Trey and jaw you can't do it like you said you mentioned some dude I haven't even heard of that you plugged into your lineup I didn't catch whose voluntary of Chicago the four Arizona Wing I'm not know hey no you need Mike Conley you need Duncan Robinson you need Draymond Green and  the fourth guy the mentioned in that deal abortus yeah Portis I eat he's gonna play I mean we know Yana's is going to miss a couple more games with a knee we know Chris Middleton is not khris Middleton anymore like Portis is a real deal  I think that's a steal of a trade for you because you're not going to miss bull bull and maybe you missed Jalen Suggs  you know next year two years from now you might miss him a little bit but you might Mike Conley may get hot again and when you this leak  here's the thing with Sogo um he is not a point guard and he never will be a point guard okay doc you know what I'm saying Suggs is not all of a sudden gonna have a role change and become a Seven assists per game guy he's not that guy he is a he is a two guard he is a Pap Beverly Marcus Smart like you could play them at the one but he's not a one he's a two um in a one's body so I I'm I don't feel like I'm giving up you know three years from now so this is gonna all of a sudden become an 18 and 8 guy I don't feel like I'm giving that up sucks is a one of the best defensive players in the entire NBA and he makes some threes and he hits some and get some steals okay he's good with fantasy gold is about 1.4 steals about two threes a game  I like him okay but I mean damn I had to do this straight doc let me tell you something man I don't know how long I've been playing on Yahoo the Yahoo format since 2011 maybe doc some like that okay 2009 2011 something like that um and I'm completely hooked now I the reason I'm so hooked on Yahoo is the rating system okay I'm big on the rating system I'm in the thousands now for basketball and Diamond rated and baseball and Diamond rated in football like my ratings are just I'm very prideful of my rating stock okay I love the rating system on Yahoo and it drives some of my decision making and it's just a huge deal for me man if only for my own satisfaction doc um it's like our stats it's like the back of our baseball card you know what I'm saying so I like it man um but but yeah and so you know I'm not gonna take out leagues where I feel like I'm in a disadvantage you know what I'm saying I got to keep my rating hi doc but I'm excited about that trade dude and I'm gonna go try to win my second ship and like four or five year period um but I've noticed I've got so what I was gonna say Doc is I think this is the first trade since I have been on the Yahoo format literally the first trade that I've been like like that cartoon where the eyeballs get big and you're like oh my God somebody has hooking me up I'm actually getting hooked up here guys I get off for trades in hockey league they get off for trades and football and baseball and basketball they all are complete in total trash they make no sense they're the most immediate reject of all time and then last night  the angels are singing Doc it's just before I go to bed just watch Lakers and Clippers and brushing my teeth getting ready to go to bed and I look at my phone I'm like  dude I gotta do this straight so I immediately like looked into it a little bit and I accepted that trade I was like I don't want to sleep on this and let this guy wake up and resend the trade-off for know I'm banging this one now and then you then you could sleep for another hour so he had to go back to the TV room and restart the whole process over again  well that's not true you were so jacked about your trade I was I was but I can turn it off pretty quickly all right pretty quickly hey it's the Terrence Mann Spike real he had another solid game last night for the Clippers now lost to the Lakers as the team man Spike real doc well I kind of thought  initially it was gonna be the Norman house Spike but Terrence Mann is balling and Terence man looks really good and  it's funny because I was riding the doctor a male bag wrote a wire column last night  and people kept asking me about T man and I was getting my t-man's mixed up because there's tree man and there's Terrence Mann yeah yeah and it was it was messing with my head a little bit it was later at night I was watching Terrence Mann I was riding about Trey man I was I was talking about lamelo ball I was very confused but Harris man here's really good for four games for the Clippers and Paul George I mean we got to figure out this Paul George knee thing like is it just a sore knee is he fine is he gonna take another game off and come back in the next one or is his knee becoming a problem and the Clippers are going to  you know  milk and nurse this very carefully the rest of the way to make sure he's healthy for the playoffs I mean I don't really know but I do know that I think Terence man is a hell of a pickup right now  okay so  agree um with that I don't I think he's a streamer for you right now it's the best I got for Terence man Awards knowski said on ESPN last night that Paul George is close to coming back and so maybe another game out but it's not going to be a long term thing that's what roads was saying last night on ESPN so take that for what it is um but Paul George's missed the last two games man has been good the last three games so it started the game before George went out when he had 23 and 12 and then man in the two games without George Wendt 146 and 4 and then last night 16-6 in two very very high efficiency he made five threes over that three games fan all the that is not a stat to be counted on from Terrence Mann in any way shape or form but um again tracking this team's man does not get shots when the big boys are healthy he just does not he'll get five shots six shots so give you five six seven points and it's nothing nickels and dimes stat line that you leave on waivers so I don't believe that the Terrence Mann spike is real doc  is the io do Sumo Spike real  it has been for  like what month and a half two months somewhere in there I mean he's been playing good and Lonzo ball not coming through that door Alex Caruso injured again and  funny thing happened yesterday I played well right like I have been been playing well but I love the fact that Chicago looked at who they were playing last night they're like all right we're playing Cleveland they go Evan Mobley and Jared Allen so guess what  we're gonna go vooch and we're gonna go big man Andre Drummond and see what happens and Drummond out of nowhere dude goes for 17 points 263 pounds and three blocks I wish I would have known this was happening I wasn't paying attention I would have FanDuel the heck out of that but I think I was kind of real I think the sumo should be a guy that's rostered everywhere and hopefully he's not gonna he's not the reason Kobe white suddenly can't make a shot I think that Kobe white thing Doc is a little bit what Steph Curry's going through right now and I don't think it's the fatigue that Steve Kerr has been talking about Curry said he's not tired I heard a broadcast for the other night said he didn't think he was tired I don't think he's tired he's a shooter he shoots from distance it home run hitters go and slumps guys and then they hit and they you know 15 home runs in a month and then the next month they'll have two home runs and step obviously a lot more consistent than that but he is a home run hitter and you're not going to hit home runs every night and you're going to go through spells where you just kind of sort of don't have it um and then you are gonna pop out of it with a 45 and never just gonna go oh step is fine I've been down this road before with Steph Curry he's tired he's tired he's not tired he's not tired he's not making shots and I feel that way about Kobe white right now he's just not making shots he's in a bit of a cold spell a bit of a like a mini slump and I think he'll pull out of it I'm not about him at all um I think the io spike is real I really do over the last month he's gone 16 three and four 1.3 steals 2.83 this is fantasy gold we've never gotten from Iowa okay 52% shooting over that month span and now Caruso's heard but he was in there and starting and playing huge minutes even with Caruso okay like I said dalen Terry is in their damn rotation and Doc doesn't even know who Dallas Terry is okay I owe is good I always good he is going to get these minutes man so that spike is real all right so the Bulls feel to me not bulbous bike not real the Terrence Mann Spike not real the bathroom Spike not real but the io speak to me Spike to me Israel wow um now you've got me in the alphabet soup doc all right talk to me about some stashes dude who do we want to stash on your roster who do you want or great audience to stash on their roster I just think there's guys you need to I think people  well the main reasons there here is to hear about guys that  not named Luca and and Trey young that they can go pick up off of a waiver wire it's it's pretty rare and fantasy Hoops that a name is big is Trey young goes down and there's not  someone sitting there on your waiver wire that you can pick up that's gonna fill in his slack but that's sort of what it is with Trey and the Hawks because they're built so weird they've got the Shantae Murray but if bogey booked out of itch is sitting there on your way where I think that's the guy you want to grab kcp Kentavious Caldwell Pope  for Denver played really well last night he was sitting on a waiver wire they were a  they were at Wednesday Thursday  team this week and that's when I needed bodies to play I picked up Kentavious Caldwell Pope he get four triples last night scored points put up put up some nice numbers he's good good guy to look at picking up and then  look at ahead the next week after cam Thomas went down oh on Monday that was terrible Dorian Finney Smith has a five-game week for the Brooklyn Nets I'm not saying Dorian Facebook is gonna come out and knock your socks off he's not going to put up huge numbers his game on Monday was garbage but in a five-game week he may give you three games worthy of  what you're looking for so those are a few guys on my list Trey man is there Terrence Mann pajam ski obviously Rick and I think he should not even be in the discussion to be picked up the Thompson Twins bathroom the other weird guy on my list and he was not on my list until Tuesday's podcast I got some  some Tweets in my ear Lamar Stevens  supposedly well he has been playing well for Memphis now he didn't do anything at all last night but all these Memphis bigs are hurt  GG Jackson is up and down like a yo-yo and Lamar Stevens when G's off Lamar plays well I'm not sure we'll ever see Gigi and Lamar play well together but deeply of those are two guys you want to keep an eye on too all right um fontecchio has my attention I actually streamed him the other night and he was he was decent um over the last couple of weeks he's at 15 points and he's at 33 per game this should not be on waivers he's 22% roster and Yahoo leagues and I get it like he's not giving you blocks not giving you steals there is high efficiency with that is it 52% um but when you are at if you're a 12 or 13 points that's waiver wire if you're in 15 points to me that's not waiver wire and if you're a three threes that's not waiver wire and he's playing he's starting um I believe that it'll probably continue here for Detroit and they may bring Oscar off the bench because fontecchio is the New York for the for the Detroit team he's there they're catching shoot guy well with all the other guys that they have so fontecchio has my eye it's deeply special um you know it he's Tim Hardaway ask right he's not going to give you a lot outside of points in threes but the points in threes to me are too good to be on waivers um you boy you mentioned Gigi Jackson man last night against Minnesota okay he was sitting logo threes in the first half and step back threes and like going off and like he was on Pace for like a 25-point game I think he had one bucket after half time okay so we literally we saw what doctors said with GG Jackson in last night's game big first half zilch second half all wrapped up into one basketball game  so doc let's hit up some comments here before we get out of here and and you know wish the people a good weekend man let's get cracking here all right Paul no keonte George or scoot Henderson for me it's keonte a 90 to 10  it's it's a hundred to zero for me  I mean where is school he's hurt and he might be out for the year now he plays for Doc tell him who does he play for Portland  and what do they do late in Seasons at least the last two years shut it down just saying man this is 100 to 0 Kiante I thought I was being generous with 90 okay so what we're saying is Paul yeah it is 100% keonte put a y in there and we'll move on all right Christian Rodgers says I traded Triple J Jaron Jackson Jr and Jabari Smith for Anthony Davis I already liked it of course  Triple J went nuts last night right after he dealt him but  I'm still waiting for the Triple J shut down the Lakers are rolling and Anthony Davis is not going anywhere I like that trade a lot  yeah and the Lakers are are in a Big Time push now this is go time right doc this is not they're no longer cruise control and maintenance and all we've turned the corner here we got about 20 games left and it's time to start the ascent to what they think is going to be a gold ball no Jabari Smith is rolling Doc and you know the last three games this had to be hard to give up from my man here he's at basically 20 points and basically like 14 rebounds over these last three games but  it's been the last three games is this sustainable the this is not how Jabari Smith has been rolling throughout his career obviously it's great to see um you know he's at 13 and 9 basically if you round up and down on the season and so I would say that these games right now are an outlier I am worried about a JJ shot down because Bane probably is not coming back smart probably is not coming back shot definitely is not coming back so Jaren Jackson Jr is kind of out there with the with the the Memphis hustle with the G League team okay so how long do they want to operate like that probably not until the end of the season and so doc if you told me that JJJ was gonna play the rest of the year and if you told me Jabari Smith was going to do what he has done over the last three games the rest of the year I would say don't do the trade but I but you can't tell me that and and I don't think those things are going to happen so I like to trade  Eman Bears wants to know  about  d-ball Paul what is going on Rick's 17 minutes 0 points  I  don't have two good games and two horrible games I I can't do it man he drives me nuts  I think we're finding out why Paul Reed is a backup and paid his back up you know he's making Zeke nnaji money he's making jock landale money okay that's the you know that's where he's at and by the way all of those guys are making a lot more than like a Russell Westbrook or a Kelly oubre right these guys in veteran minimum contracts for the love of God make it make sense um but yeah Paul Reed I'm looking at his game log here Doc and the last game was like what it was a Boston game though so probably a matchup thing Nick nurse went small in that game and that's the problem there's these games were Nick nurses like I've got to go small to try to keep up with the others because they don't have the 35 points a game from Joel embiid so when they're trying to make that up and I mean Paul Reed didn't score a point so I got to put dudes out there they're gonna put the ball in the hole sacrifice rebounding and defense I mean look  Nick nurse is my guy okay I'm buddies with Nick nurse I feel bad for him they're screwed without Joel embiid I mean stick a fork in them they are done they are a toasty turkey ready to come out and eat okay um and so I don't know Paul read to me is a streamer doc if it's a Thursday night and there's three games and I'm down five rebounds in my matchup I'm gonna go ahead and pick up Paul Reed and put him in my lineup but that's it that's that's all I got on Paul Reed I do like who they play in the next two games they play they play somebody who has got a couple decent centers and then they played Dallas who has three big men so I think Paul Reed's gonna play well and his next two games but man he's just he's rough and you know Nick nurse may be your guy I'm not a big Nick nurse guy I'm still mad at him about Chris Boucher and then 20 years he sat on that man and Paul Reed  is dark around play Boucher either this is not a nickname dude this is a bullshit motor thing stop very guy Nick nurse boucher's 31 now dude he wasn't when Nick nurse got him he's 25 he was always lazy  but a lazy player man  what's up doc and Rick it's Brian B can you guys rate these players in order  amen Thompson Andre Drummond Grayson Allen  Rick I'm gonna take this one first I'm gonna go my order is Grayson amen Drummond  I'm gonna go Drummond Allen and and I'm in um in in that order let me let me just quickly hear look at Drummonds game log just to make sure but I I don't think I'm going to change my answer here where is so no I'm not going to change I mean God Bless America these are some numbers man 17 and 26 20 and 11 okay seven and eight not big then 11 and 8 and 10 and 15 none and no no these are solid numbers man and look there's going to be games where where he doesn't play a lot and then like Doc explained like the Twin Tower thing okay so when you aggregated all and accumulated all it's all going to end up with a pretty darn good stat line for Android trumpet I do trust him on Grace now and obviously kind of low on the points high in the three it's good to see and then I'm and I think it's gonna be kind of up and down here I mean I love the kid but that's how I would stack a trump and one on Grayson two and I'm in read  oh this is nice  this dude acts like I talked about my 30 Team league for like 30 minutes to show uh Doc is 13 is the biggest iron topic there is well Rick's awesome in that league and I don't think we spend that much time on it so sorry um Barnyard Bros come on man come on man you do not it I would bust your balls if you excessively talked about your 30 deep team I would take you deep Brett Barnyard Brothers just know that I am the 30d police here I will take doc deep talk too much about his Squad right I just talked too much about my squad in Sam hickeys letter with that trade that we talked about yeah that that was I now next week he'll be back with hinkis hinkis number or whatever is the most ironing topic there is ah  Brian B wants to know is it me or is Halliburton Tyrese Howard not 100% are they playing him because the 65 game rule he hasn't looked the same since the injury that's just not true that's just not true that's just not true Brian I got to get you right Brian we got to get you NBA league pass my friend um Hallie was Halle again before the All-Star break the minutes restriction was removed he had 10 threes in the All-Star Game he's been a badass in every game but one since the All-Star break he's going like over this stretch like right around 20 and 10 the Pacers have won seven of their last 10 games all with Tyrese Halliburton trust me the I mean I watched last night's game why are the wire Halliburton literally took over the game like Max trusted the night before although with assist  he had Bam Bam Bam Bam four times in a row after making a step back three three of them to see how come one of them to turn her and and said night night to the game Tyreese Halliburton is Tyrese salbert and I am not worried at all I mean clearly we have a handy that could get re-injured but I don't see an injured player out there right now I don't either I do understand the question though because the numbers are different than they were before yeah I mean I think that's what Brian's point is I think the numbers are different but like you said he's leading in different ways maybe you know like we were talking about Kobe white we were talking about Steph Curry these guys you know your shot comes and goes you get on streaks you get in cold spells and you know maybe he's not bombing threes all the time but he's he's helping out with the sis and the Pacers are winning they're rolling and I don't think there's anything wrong with Tyrese Albert um thoughts on Joel and beat on a 200 slots  which means  you got to cut him or you gotta keep him currently ranked 8th in the standings Lee goes up to the end of the season Rick if there's no ill and you're trying to get in the playoffs and win a ring are you hanging on to Joel and beat right now you have to he's you just can't drop you just can't drop them they're if look I would I feel better about Joel embiid coming back than I do about Julius Randle coming back Julius Randle and the Knicks still have not ruled out surgery that is very got cut so now it's about the comeback sham shirani and Adrian rewards now scale reporting that there's hope and optimism which I flush because it means nothing but they're talking about a late March return to the court at which point a ramp up would ensue so there is a chance especially in a league is he says here where goes all the way up to the end of the season I think that's a horror horrible way to do it I would shop off at least the last week maybe the last two weeks because that's silly season okay that's not indicative of the team that has gotten you to that point but okay you're gonna play it out to the ending might actually come back for that second to last week or that last week and if you get that far and then you're you know  taking a syringe and injecting into your team Joel embiid you can't drop him to me do you can't drop him  all right yeah I don't know man I I don't know I I even if he comes back and gets on the court in March and then he I mean maybe like I think I think we're gonna see Joel embiid play like three meaningful regular season games the rest of the way and for me I don't know if I can hold him for the rest of the season for that but like you said there's so much risk involved in dropping him in case he does come back early in plays like here's where this takes my brain be Doc I've done this before you drop a guy like Joel embiid doc what is going to happen when this when when Eon drops to L&B what is going to happen  news is going to break the next day that Joe will be his resume on court activities okay well that could happen where I'm going with somebody is going to pick him up right oh yeah he's somebody in his league is going to pick him up so immediately then you're going to be like oh shit I just screwed up okay now check this out what if that guy that picks up to Ellen bead plays my man Eon in the championship round and he has indeed and aeon does notion is going to want to jump off of a cliff okay yeah those are big ifs they are but you have to prepare for that he's gonna be feeling the same way if he sat on Joel embiid till the end and we don't see him again until the till the actual playoffs he on good luck with that decision uh Doc and Kim have weighed in last one Dan sekiro Vincennes or Derek Lively in Nyan Cat they're both on the wire Ben Simmons is dead to me dead who is that  who has been Simmons when I see Ben Simmons now I think Bill Simmons which is very very unfortunate because I don't like that guy and I won't say his name again I've had problems with that guy over the years so okay and all you guys like him and his cute little podcast I think that guy sucks okay so um and he thinks I saw and that's fine um but but Ben Simmons doc he is dead to me man heard again  he's heard again this guy will never be the same guy he will never be the 16-8 and 8 triple double dude with the defense of goodies that he was in Philly that guy's gone never coming back no I I agree um I I'm guessing there's somebody better than Derek Lively to pick up off your wire although Lively block four shots here tonight he starting for Dallas  but I would scour that wire pretty hard and find make sure you picking up the right guy I don't think the right guy has been Simmons now they do play five games next week but Ben Simmons will be lucky to play in two of those so throw the five games out the window and take a look around Rick I think we're out of time dude we're right at 59 minutes that's the Wheelhouse is where we like to be I'll be back on Tuesday with Ken the K train Crites one of cameras favorite people you and I will be back here doing this again next Thursday maybe we'll have a clear picture on what people should be doing with Joe Ellen bead by then LeBron could have scored his 50,000 point and  we'll go from there  you know man doc thanks for joining us everybody on the road of our fantasy basketball podcast good luck and go in some games yo
