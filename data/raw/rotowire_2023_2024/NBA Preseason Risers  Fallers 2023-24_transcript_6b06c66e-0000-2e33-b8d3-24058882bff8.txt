Warriors who is 80P right now is 138 on Yahoo  is it finally time Jerry Montgomery has not played this preseason but the other starters have appeared in at least three of the four preseason games at the Warriors played comingo has a 31% usage rate in these games scoring 30.2 points on 1 8. 2 5  the thin bench the old starters that's the formula I like you're right and he's had a heck of a season yeah my man who's your my only concern about Mega is the presence of Chris Paul actually I do think Community is gonna get more minutes this year he's a great value on DraftKings basketball especially going a little bit too high for my taste on Underdog but yes I like kamego for for a breakout this year at least an improvement of what we've seen in the past couple of seasons  who was your first preseason  my Riser guy who's up is Jeremy Sohan of the San Antonio Spurs adp's at 1:34 it's as high as 145 on Yahoo Wednesday night Coke coach Popovich announced that Trey Jones last year's starting point guard would be coming off the bench and second year six foot eight forward Jeremy so on will be the starting point guard hello the second year player from Baylor has a draft pedigree hey remember he was the number nine pick in the summer of 2022  and as Alex wrote on RotoWire Wednesday night in the 17th season were so hands off 30 plus minutes he averaged 16 and a half points over seven rebounds over three assists and 1.5 Steals and blocks per game and in those games he was at forward not point guard directing the offense so you'd almost expect the assist to go up he does have some free throw shooting issues he shot a thin hair under 70% from the charity stripe last year  we'll see who's running things in the fourth quarter but this seems like a very positive development for Sohan Shannon how far up do you bump so hand in your rankings  I I bump them up quite a bit his ADP is around 130 right now that's averaged across all sites on best ball I you know for 1:30 if I'm drafting specialty heads the Hat Head to Head or a points League I'm bumping him up about 20 spots and that would actually put him around the range of where he's going on Underdog he's that one and Underdog he is going higher now since that that news of you know being named the starting point guard it's it's an interesting case I picked them at 97 in a basketball draft last night I do think he's within playing that range I like him quite a bit more for best fall where percentages do not impact a player's value than I do in rotisserie rotisserie I would still be hard-pressed to take them you know higher than 120 ish well you're fishing for upside morham and best ball versus no point in being conservative in best ball right and and I will say like the the starting point guard assignment doesn't mean that he's going to be out there averaging five six seven assists per game I think this team's going to share the ball there's going to be a handful of guys that average force is per game you know including one guy that I'll discuss later  all right well Alex tell us about our friends at Vivid Seats  NBA season is here on behalf of our friends at Vivid Seats let's get one thing clear

savings  who's been impressing you in preseason and  we're going to go to Chicago and discuss Kobe white he is one of my risers for today Kobe white has been locked into the starting lineup for the Bulls he's their starting point guard it looks like that's going to stick it's been that way all preseason even last night when some of the regular sat for the Bulls they kept Colby white in there at the point guard spot and they put in other players to soon move to soon move and others to to start and keep their core bench unit of Caruso Torrey Craig and if you others together  Kobe white is an interesting late round pick current ADP of 152 you can get them around 141 on Yahoo 165 on underdog  Kobe White's per 36 numbers from last year per yeah per 36 numbers from last season 15 points 4.4 rebounds 4.2 assist 1.1 steals 2.73 pointers better percentages than he had earlier in his career as well he said up to 44.3% from the floor 87.1 from the line  I like Kobe white start living up to some of his pedigree you know he was a first round pick number seven overall in 2019 he's not going to be the he's not gonna be a giant playmaker at point guard you know Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan again I probably be the two assist leaders on this team still but Kobe white can get you three and a half for three and a half to four and a half for game he's gonna hit 3-pointers probably score 12 to 14 points for game as long as he's locked into about a 30 minute role I really like Kobe white quite a bit as a late round guard it makes a lot of sense right because the last year the Bulls walled in me awkward with ball being out all season and they had an ugly mess of point guard starting why not try a young Kobe white who's got scoring upside because it just didn't work with the other combinational last year  yep and they are Beyond Levine and DeRozan they're pretty thin for scores in the backcourt so if either of those guys get hurt I think Kobe white gets the ball more  I have some bad news guys  I might be out on John Collins our our pre-season one of our sleepers John Collins who's being drafted 102 on Yahoo ADP just invisible during preseason just like he's not even out there watching the Jazz highlights watching the games I'm like is he out there I don't know so perfectly worst part of his Hawks game and brought it to you yeah exactly it's like it's gonna be the same exact issue again and like yes maybe this is his birth 36 in preseason this is four game sample  14.7 points a 9.6 shots  pretty low six point nine rebounds 0.9 assists and half a stock that's the worst that's pretty bad you know like I think he's still draftable after pick 100 I don't want to say he's like undraftable he's like a bust sleeper if that's even a thing but I'm just like I'm really discouraged like it especially because their front court is kind of they got guys it's not like they Kelly only big minutes I drafted Kelly Olynyk with my second to last pick in NFP Casey I was like well you know why not um for some positions as well but I'm just I'm worried  a young Taylor Hendricks might become a problem too it's it's concerning  and you know Atlanta gave him every chance they wanted him to be their number two star and it just never panned up  well you got someone on your end can who you also are kind of down on  ya love the player hate the fantasy side Al Horford of my Boston Celtics it's hard to say a guy with this low in ADP is down but he is down 80P at 1:44 but he's doing as well as 125 on Yahoo look despite Boston's past success with big lineups the 37 year old Horford will not be a starter at the beginning of the Season instead it looks like Boston's gonna go with Holiday Inn White in the back court and Tatum Brown and porzingis as the starting front Court this is good news for Derek white managers is there was some debate that white would be the one going to the bench it's also good news for Celtics fans who are worried about Jalen Brown's ball handling skills rather have two true guards out there but anyway back to Big Al he is much more valuable and real Hoops than fantasy for late pick centers on Yahoo I prefer Steven Adams James Wiseman zubac in LA or even Isaiah Jackson in Indianapolis for his blocks just you know  he's 37 he's always going to get the second of back to backs off I think Boston's very happy to rest out Big Al until the playoffs I I endorse everything Ken said except for Gene what James Wiseman yeah  I I agree there's a way if you're in a 12 team league and you're picking Horford like 125 you gotta shoot for someone with upside like yeah or because zero upside zero  okay Shannon who's up next for you all right I hinted at mentioning a San Antonio Spur and I've got one who's stock is rising Zach Collins 25 year old Center we've discussed him a little bit this present but he's going to be starting at Center alongside Wembley who will be at the four four the Spurs Collins had a pretty good season last year and 23 minutes for average he was 11.6 points 6.4 rebounds 2.9 and assist 0.8 blocks with 52% from the floor 76% from the line  he also attempted 2.33 pointers so it is possible that's a growing area of his game where we see him actually Eclipse 1-3 pointer made per contest I really like what I've seen from Zach Collins this pre-season in 22 minutes he's averaging basically 15 and 5 with with I'm sorry 15 points 7.3 rebounds five uses as well and 1.33 pointers made and again that's only in 22 minutes per him starting alongside Wendy I think will work well and Zach Collins is a pretty good playmaker for for a center where I could see him averaging three and a half assists per game from the from the pivot  and I think it gets more minutes because with Wendy now they don't need Wendy's gonna take care of protecting the rim obviously at eight foot nine or whatever he is like Collins can now kind of be the power forward on defense  center on offense  and I think Popovich might finally stick  to a more standard rotation now that he's got some Talent on this roster versus the crazy tanking resting everybody all the time mess that was the last few seasons and going back to Horford Collins being selected right in that same range in most drafts so I'd much rather have college much right yeah I should have put him in there sorry he's a columns right now ADP 132  my final preseason notable is an up PJ Washington although this is partially because other guys are down the miles British situation I just don't know I don't know what to tell you I have no Insight I have no Savory it's just who knows and also  Brandon Miller you know I'm not sold summer league and preseason can bind 12 points on 3824.82 shooting six boards three or three assists with 2.7 turnovers 1.7 stocks it's just I don't know I don't know if he's ready but PJ Washington before Ken's Clippers  uh dismantled the Hornets yesterday and preseason was averaging a higher averages but Washington had a more a more muted game yesterday he's averaging 19 points on 17th games for 36 so look we've seen him return top 100 value before he's in a pretty good situation despite the contract dispute out of a dispute but they were they were really taking their sweet time signing him I just think he's in good situation this year and he's proven it before and no Plumlee you know plumblee was there for what 2/3 of the season last year before he went to the Clippers so freed up some minutes possibly at the center position for Washington as well see how williams does  you have another down  can I do have another down I do have another down buddy hield in Indiana  so look  managers a buddy hield especially in nine category  Roto League remember he'll being awesome I mean last season he ranked 26th in nine category total season rotos stats 26  most of that was coming from banging 3.6 triples again a game with great percentages when he played 31 minutes a game and appeared in 80 games 80 games who does that in the NBA anymore but he'll came off the bench for all of Indies preseason games with sophomore Benedict mathura and starting in Stead the Pacers signed Bruce Brown who you might think is as old as buddy hield but is actually only 27 they signed Brown to a two-year deal and looks like brown not healed will start at small forward this is the last year of healds contract extension talks fail this summer and 30 years of age Hill is on a very different timeline than Halliburton is 23 miles Turner who's 27 and math learning is 21 just it seems safe to assume is minutes per game are going to decrease coming off the bench for the Pacers he's sure not going to see 31 a game and he really seems like a logical trade candidate at the deadline where presumably you know he'll be an Off the Bench score for a contender  I do I the one caveat being healed hash shown that he can hold fantasy value in a ventral in the past so I I agree his his numbers are are going to be down this year he's still going to hit and insane amount of three pointers if he can keep his steals rebounds up a respectable levels in a ventral even if you only playing 25 26 minutes per I think they're still fantasy value there it's just gonna be a lot tougher for him to crack top 100 value there's absolute value he's going to bang he's gonna hit a lot of Threes but his stats will be down from last year and those that may have wrote him to wrote a wire a roto League Victory is last year should not expect the same thing  Shannon who's your third preseason up or down candidate this pains me to say this I've got a Detroit Piston whose stock is falling Jaden ivy  fifth overall pick in the 2022 draft had a very good rookie season for the Pistons averaged 6 16 points per game 5.2 assists 1.63 pointers week on percentages but he showed some growth towards the end of last season he has been stuck in a sixth man role all preseason for the Pistons Monty Williams is trying to put his stamp on the team and figure out a rotation that makes sense for him personally I think Ivy is a very important piece for the Pistons to develop for their long-term success at and I want him to be the starting shooting guard alongside Cade in that back court but I don't believe it's going to happen this year he's at least at the start of the Season he will be deployed as the Sixth Man  you know that's gonna be it's gonna be an interesting rotation for the Pistons it means Cade Cunningham Azar Thompson Isaiah Burks seen a lot of minutes yeah I'm not I'm not that worried about Alec Burks honestly Jalen Duren is the other the fifth starter for the Pistons and then off the bench for the backyard you do have Burke's he's there killing Hayes had a very good preseason he is a very good on the ball perimeter defensive player he is going he is I believe that he has  his Haze is a success this preseason has earned him a spot in the rotation they have Monty Morris honestly I think it's Ivy and A's that are the two backup point guards or the two backup guards for the Pistons at the start of the season  so we shall see Thompson's bend the revelation  Azar Thompson's being drafted too low he is looked fantastic this preseason he is a great defensive player he's shooting much better than I think most people expected his playmaking solid but Jaden Ivy is the one who is taking a hit so I have Gene Ivy in our staff keeper League I kept him early on and basketball drafts I was happy to take them and in the 85 to 100 range now not so much I worry about his value for for his fantasy value for the season  yeah the Pistons for being as bad as they projected beam I'm sorry Shannon have a weirdly deep rotation that I talked to predict I I legit think that they have a better eight-man 9 man rotation then like 12 teams in the NBA I like their roster I'm not saying they're gonna be successful this year they've got a lot of young guys have to develop but their top eight is super interesting well we need to we need obviously we need a healthy you're a Kate which hope this totally totally unbiased all right you've blurred out your Detroit background for some reason these video it's like here you're not proud of the Detroit stuff there was going on  I'm just trying to get away from all these reflections of lights and you know well let's let's wrap this thing up with our nfbc observations you guys co-managed a team I drafted my team last night we both streamed our drafts so if you go to the world of wire NBA YouTube page and click on the button that says live streams or something of the like they will be in there I'll start with you guys what do you what are your summer observations from either just a team together or the nft in general well very fun to bicker what on-screen during a live draft what I think our biggest point of angst was we were really hoping to get one of our sleeper point guards late  be that Conley or Schroeder up in Toronto or yeah Mike Conley in Utah  we had a few other queued up and they all got gobbled up as we sat there at the turn that's the you're at the turn the Killer is just watching those  23 some odd players go off the board and man we were like okay we gotta get one of these three or four sleeper point guards and they all went and we were not you know grinding our teeth  yeah and you know to take away the main takeaway for me is drafting a team with another person  is always going to be difficult I know there's any way to properly and it's nothing against Ken Ken you're fantastic man you're my favorite uncle  I look up to you and respect you but I do not respect your basketball opinions what you were you guys drafting at 12 we were 11 so we both not I drafted from 11 as well okay so we both we both drafted from the same spot you got I don't think that's really go through your entire team here you got Trey young Jaron Jackson Cunningham booch Randall we both have Randall and drafted him we both drafted Randall and round five um we both have Keegan Murray  we both have Trey Murphy  and we both have Camp Thomas yeah and as you as you probably expect the RotoWire my League's feature where it sucks in all the players and teams from your league gives you the lineup advice it's a great feature and it's works on a whole bunch of different commission sites and also works on nft Casey and it says we're number one on the power rankings but of course that's because we tend to agree with the RotoWire projections pick with RotoWire in mind  I know you got really mad because we couldn't let go of it it kept bugging us you really hated Shannon the fact we took former piston Jeremiah Grant in the sixth round yeah that's probably where we should have gone CJ McCollum thinking about our point guard problems more of just like the roster build and statistical category you know categorical targets that we had at that time I mean it was a huge run on forwards at the time cam Johnson went right before then Jeremy Grant Kyle kuzma Zach Collins who is Ford eligible on nfkc Jabari Smith but we really wanted a guard in that spot unfortunately like Ken and mentioned you know Tyler hero janelyn William Simon's his cell CJ McCollum CJ McCombs the guy who we probably should have went probably should take Macomb but we were too busy focused on entertaining the masses during our live stream to go in to a hard debate  with this look I it's talking too much I know it's hard right look I don't I don't like McCallum in the sex I'll just I don't like what the sex so like but you're right the Guard the guard situation is bad after that like you're talking about Rozier McCallum Derek white who I think is way too early in the seventh Reeves yeah I you know but I wasn't you know what I don't think it really bothered us until near the end when all those sleeper point guards went off the board then we were like oh geez yeah that's good earlier that's that's a point that like that's the main thing from the NFP Casey that I wanted to bring up if you're planning on doing one of these drafts  I feel like the forward pool is shallow get your forwards early  and there's a lot of sleeper guards that you can take late like complete Flyers at the end of the draft  because I kind of ran into a situation where I felt like I didn't have enough forwards and the multi-position eligibility and NFP Casey's very small yeah you need to start to centers and there are only four words Center eligible multi eligibility there's no guard forward multi eligibility so those four words Center guys exactly why I took Randall I was like this is a this is a steering Jackson so we went all into Jerry Jackson yeah I think Randall yeah that's something I will be considered except Durant was on the board for me so um it looks like he was on the board to Durant over Jaron Jackson come on I took youngest and Durant back to back I and those those fix makes sense I think it's solid approach you know Ken and I very consciously reached on Jaron Jackson in this format specifically because we know he's better eligible yeah Ford Center eligible blocks and centers in general are at a premium especially those ones that have good percentage is a long with blocks and threes Jared Jackson's just kind of like one of the perfect players for the NFP Casey format my hope is he just you know plays the career high in games picks up some of the scoring slack with Miranda out and proves were the top 20 selection we're not bearing a point guard we have Trey young and Cade Cunningham we need Cade to stay healthy and Chris Paul I think  Chris Paul's oh we got Chris Paul yes I think Chris Paul's value is not going to be as depressed as people expect with golden state I actually think he could have a ridiculous number of assist his scoring will be down but he's gonna be setting up Klay and Curry for for Gigantic he's gonna have nights where he just has tennis list off Kate and Klay and Curry three-pointers only so we took we missed out on  all those sleeper guards we mentioned we had to settle for Chianti George as our last pick which I like that's fine maybe becomes a starter in you know they they don't I think he is probably the best point guard on that roster tht you know important factor Court Tucker who we've talked a lot about the last couple episodes I like them but a lot of folks a lot of pundits do not believe he'll be able to hold on to the starting point guard job and if it's not him I believe they're going to give keyonte George a little bit of a leash there and see how he goes I think they're just kind of bringing him along slowly oh great last pick flyer we'll see  all right gentlemen well this three car fantasy Trainwreck has hit the end of the line
