hey everybody  welcome back to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast sponsored by Underdog Vivid Seats and rival fantasy  Thursday October 26th my special guest once again  is NBC's know Reuben my former co-worker Rick Hamlin is under the weather today and will not be here no and I are gonna break down a bit busy Wednesday night for you all right after this Jam hey know I've been podcasting for like 10 years but I rarely ever hosted or did anything of importance I just sort of showed up when they call me and  started talking so I always forget to do stuff like say remember to like And subscribe and and mash all those buttons that you can so guys just do do all that stuff  so we can we can keep this thing going as I said I'm trying I'm trying to be sick but I keep fighting it off camera cameras got the flu or something so no part of the part of the problem is going to be that you are so you answer my text so quickly and you're always like yeah I can do it whatever so it's just easy to ask you to do stuff when when we're in a jam so  you might be getting more phone calls for me going forward fine by me it's always fun potting with you and just talking about basketball and now we have actual games to talk about instead of just speculating about what the season's going to look like because when we go however many months it was with no games eventually we just we hit on all the points everything's gonna happen and now we can say we are right on half of it wrong on half of it so that's pretty cool  yeah and what else is cool is I got a box in the mail yesterday and it had this Rotoworld  had this little wire I mean it's 22 years guys that's fair have this Roto wire pullover Under Armour Polo over in it and I'm like this is some sweet spot I'm fired up I'm putting it on even I can't say the name right half the time so thanks to Roar for sending me some stuff I was got a hat and busted that I get me t-shirt know if you keep doing this as much as you've done it lately you you may be in line through some RotoWire swipe as well  I won't complain about more fantasy clothes I can't nobody  fantasy clothes I like that I have not heard not heard that term uh all right no so unlike you I was sitting in my office last night with all three of my TVs going um the league pass is free right now so you can literally watch every game if you want to I was bouncing all over the place I was having a good time I was having a party in my office by myself just enjoying some hoops I kind of envisioned you do in the same thing but you just told me that you had a different plan last night  no the yeah I mean obviously 90% of the time I'm sitting in front of multiple screens watching all the games and riding about them but last night I was able to go up to Charlotte's about two hour drive for me and watch my Hawks go and look freaking awful Jalen Johnson was fun saddiq Bey play pretty hard and I enjoyed watching him play got some steals so I don't expect to stick but  it's it's not fun when you when you drive to hours to go watch your team and the guards the two guards that are getting paid a ton of money combined to shoot what was it for for 26 and yeah just looks bad  yeah no other way to put and you know Charlotte was fun I enjoyed watching Charlotte which was kind of cool but yeah want to see more Jalen Johnson minutes and I want to see the Hawks play better basketball but it was still a lot of fun and  a lot of fun fantasy guys that I've been talking about played pretty well between Mark Williams and PJ Washington lamelo was pretty fun to watch as well so hopefully  the Hawks can get more minutes for Kong Wu and more production from train to Dante those are my two requests  a convo  minutes were concerned transition Dante combined to shoot seven  well trade was 4 1 9 I mean I think he's out there as a deep sleeper if you're in a deep league right now  Jalen Johnson was 9 or 13 21.7 boards Off the Bench he played 29 minutes also had two steals in a block so and he also looked good like that he fit the eye test and if you're in a deep league and looking for someone to pick up off Weaver's today say  some of the other big names are gone I think Jalen Johnson is at least worth a fly right now but you gotta have somebody you're comfortable dropping you can't just you can't just go  you just can't give up on guys you drafted this quickly for the most part yeah I'm not expecting him to keep doing 21.7 boards to steals in a block but he's gonna play a pretty large role of the bench it's going to be him saddiq Bey and DeAndre Hunter kind of cycling between the forward minutes there so I think he played 29 minutes last night I would expect 24 is probably more of a realistic number but he was a lot of fun like the Hawks have been really good offensively because of Trey young but they haven't had a ton of like really good transition play over the past few years and like I just feel like Jalen Johnson I mean I think it was towards the end of the first quarter of the first half he had like three straight dunks or maybe he had two and and bogged on bogged out of it also had that poster dunk that came out of nowhere but he's just so a one-man fast break he was getting steals he did have a block and it's just another element to the Hawks offensively that they just haven't had so he's gonna play Big minutes I don't know if he'll start because saddiq Bey fits as kind of a floor space a little bit more and you kind of need as much space as possible when you have Clint capela starting at Center  but Jalen Johnson's going to play enough of a role to be worth rostering I think it's standard leaks even well and we're gonna talk more about Jalen Johnson on Tuesday because my guest instead of Noah it's going to be Bob RAF and the voice of the Hawks you guys are all going to be Hawks out by the time I'm done with you living in Atlanta and everything but yeah Bob should be here Tuesday and he's always super fun one of my favorite people to have on the show so be sure to check that out next Tuesday all right some of the good stuff that happened last night some of the good League past stuff the Lucas 30-point triple-double to open the season despite his calf injury was pretty sweet the entire OKC Thunder lineup Sans Chet Holm we're in was pretty sweet yes she was a monster Chris steps for zingas debut for Boston telling you man Boston is Boston's the team that I think that's the one to be Persia was crazy good Cade Cunningham scored 30 Zion Williamson made it through the whole game without  getting hurt and put up pretty decent numbers some guy named Desmond Bane that I got bashed for drafting like 31 points a full stat line five or six threes he's the man I don't think we need to break in those guys down there not available in anyone's fantasy league the only thing you can do is go to Underdog that the over on those guys you know  you can also go to FanDuel you can go wherever but I've been playing a lot of Underdog Noah and I I won like  like 70 bucks the first night opening night  and then I of course swung for the fences and tried to win big money last night was doing like five five over five overs which is essentially like a parlay and I came close but I'm gonna get back they get a little more conservative tonight and get some money back but man Underdog underdogs pretty fun  cam Thomas plays for the Nets all right  he set a record NBA records scoring 36 points off the bench in the season opener he hit eight three-pointers  he didn't do a lot else I got him in my 30 Team league which we were supposed to be breaking that down today I think there's so much excitement with all these games and so many players to talk about I don't know how much we're going to get into that one guy I had I did draft in that League was Camus and then I put him on my bench for the week so I missed out on the 36 point explosion do you have any Camp Thomas thoughts um I certainly have thoughts I can't remember if I have him in any I remember after their first preseason game I think he actually started that one because I think cam Johnson was out and he started had a really big scoring night and I think maybe some people were excited and some people said well you know we know he can score but that's it but it really kind of felt to me like okay like he's probably gonna be their Sixth Man and be inconsideration for six man of the year because a lot of times it's whoever can score them the most coming off the bench is certainly at least in consideration  and he's not going to average 36 points per game Off the Bench but when he comes in the game he's gonna have the green light to kind of shoot whenever he wants usually if he has it going like he did in this one so no you're not going to get anything else aside from points he'll be on the court enough to get you know some other stats here and there but nothing consistent aside from buckets and he's pretty good free throw shooter pretty good at getting to the line as well and points lie is I think is where you're gonna make your money on Campus  you make money on campus Because  he's the most inconsistent fantasy player I've maybe ever come across you know looking back at last year's game game log on January 11th against the Bulls he had he played one minute and scored 0 points  the game before that he played one minute and scored 0 points then on Friday November 4th because I know where plays 32 minutes scores 17 he has 21 the next night and then 19 the next night and then he goes for six points and four points  then the minutes just died and go away he's down to 743 yada yada yada  all of a sudden on Saturday December 10th there's a 33 Point explosion and then it really gets interesting in February he went 44 47 and 43 points in back-to-back-to-back games  and but then he disappeared again there's a two-point game there's a seven-point game there's a 0 point game there's a 4-point game so he's just all over the map and in  along with all of that it's mostly just points in threes that he's getting so I'm super excited to have him in my 30 Team league I'm I'm getting him in my lineup next week and if I drafted him in a regularly I'd be kind of excited about it too I mean how can you not be excited after 36 Point opening night debut but do you think would you cut who would you cut players to pick him up no would I get if you had Taylor Horton Tucker who kind of struggled last night  who else who else would be droppable for  like bogie bogdanovich maybe would you drop down of its to pick up cam Thomas maybe I think Taylor Horton Tucker I was actually talking about him was exactly the other day because people were asking about it in our in our Q&A  and I didn't even realize that he had started in the preseason so I checked I was like okay wow he actually is starting and playing pretty well I didn't expect that to continue during the regular season but evidently it did after he started every single preseason game so there's a reason for optimism with Taylor Horton Tucker even if he struggled in their first game I don't think he's gonna be incredible but I don't know if I'm dropping him quite yet for campus but I think a guy like Bogey's a great example of somebody that's kind of a safe place that you may have gone and like the later rounds that okay like  he'll probably still be there on the waiver wire or somebody with similar production probably still be there on the waiver wire let me take the upside swing on campus while I can and then if it is like you said which is very very possible and then it's inconsistent like he has 36 and then next game he shoots two for 11 and has 7 points like that's very possible as well he's an incredible score when he's on and when he's not hitting shots it's frustrating so I would take the upside swing might as well because like I mean like what if what if he becomes more consistent and he averages 20 points per game Off the Bench this season I think that's a lot more valuable than what Bogie's gonna give you that pretty consistent just estimating 13 points per night so  yeah I like that and yes so I mean if you got a guy at the end of your roster who let's say you drafted miles Bridges  I think he's no yeah you just go go pick up the hottest free agent you can find which in many cases maybe maybe cam speaking at Taylor and Horton Tucker last night there were several things I did not like about what went down the fact that you only had eight points almost all of them in the first half  I did not enjoy that you know I had forces  he only hit three of nine shots any only played 22 minutes I was kind of going all in on tht and the end of last week I had him in FanDuel I had him in some some Underdog stuff I've got him on some fantasy teams so he was hugely disappointing but he started at point guard all pre-season for this team it didn't work out last night but I'm I think you at least Gotta Give  tht till the end you know beginning of next week before you you're dropping him just because of the expectations we had coming in so I think it's too right yeah and those like looking at the minutes like it was a pretty weird game for you so I haven't gotten to go back and like really look at what happened but Laurie Market only played 31 minutes Walker so I only played 22 looks like a bunch of bench guys played about two and a half minutes so maybe gonna add that on in a closer game and then got blown out so yeah and I mean they gave 10 guys rotation minutes and I think that's kind of what happens is a lot of teams are probably going with more of an Iron Man rotation but they gave 10 guys rotation is this time Chris done and Colin Sexton played Chris Dunn played almost 1 6  I think that I mean if you're trying to Guardian Fox like Chris Dunn's probably their best option to guard Fox and I don't know again I haven't really gotten to look back at what the matchups were but I think they're trying to slow down this high octane King's offense then maybe tht isn't the best option for that maybe that limited is that time I guess I probably be giving it another game or two before I'm all ready to drop THD if you bought in on him enough to to draft him I mean I didn't anywhere but I think that if you took the late round swing on him give it a few more games  well THC reminds me a little bit of worst deal back in the back in the day Boris getting a bunch of weight towards the end of his career and we used to make fun of him eating Big Macs and stuff and he is T is not a small dude like he's got some girth he's gonna have trouble staying in front of some of these some of these cars probably but he's also really good offensively and and and  I I think he's gonna bounce back in the next game A Funny Thing Happened on the way to my Victor woman Yamaha prayed celebration last night as I  built my whole  day around that Derek Lively  comes out of nowhere for the Mavericks not out of nowhere but sort of out of nowhere I mean we knew he was gonna play for them a little bit because they really don't have big men that they can put out there but Derek Lively came off the bench to start the game but  they quickly realized that was a mistake he needed to start so he started the second half and actually kind of blew up and had a big game he was making plays on both ends of the floor  he had an incredible  put-back dunk in traffic that that did not look like something a rookie would do and he battled with Zack what's his Zach Collins  and the Mavericks desperately need a big man who can score and play defense to compliment Luca and Kyrie and as great as Luke was last night as fun as when he was in the second half of that well in the fourth quarter is really when he came alive there I have only really impressed me last night I think he's he's gonna be bannered around in the Rookie of the Year chatter and it's only one game I know that I still think when we gonna win it I still think Chad's going to be dominant but Lively looked great last night  he really did and I remember getting the notification and seeing that Jason Kidd was rolling with Derek Jones Junior in Mexico but in the starting unit and I was like  that just doesn't it doesn't make sense like you're going against one seven foot four seven foot five Victor one minyama at power forward so they are they also have Zach Collins down there at Center and they said you know what we're gonna go with Cleburne to kind of guard the starting center and Grant Williams who I'm is an undersized power forward like I want to say six seven six five something like that he's pretty just smaller power forward and he's a really good Defender but it's like you probably need a little bit of size down low and Lively it started all preseason so then he figured it out okay Derek Lively and Josh green makes more sense to Derek Jones in your musically but cool we figured that out but to me it was okay Lively is going to be a solid fantasy option because he's a rookie should have some good games should have some bad games but he started and a lot of the rookies aren't really getting minutes to start their careers because a lot of them went to places that have a lot of depth but he was able to come off the bench and play really well so that was really encouraging to me it's not just an opportunity based thing like he was awesome so I mean a double double e played 31 minutes almost but I'd be very shocked if he wasn't in the start of unit for their next game yeah I mean I  I did a RotoWire mailbag column last night it should be posting time and I got like three different Derek Lively questions and my my comment on all of them was the Mavericks need this guy like they need him right now they don't  they don't have anybody else really that they can throw out there and play center that's gonna do what he does so I mean I think  it's trial by fire I think he showed you know his coach and Mark Cuban and Luca and everybody else a lot last night and and it was pretty cool one of the stories at night I think  the entire San Antonio Spurs team was  pretty much as advertised know like we knew Collins was going to be good right he's gonna be a solid fantasy Center we know points so hand was gonna be fun the guy had the ball in his hands the whole night didn't shoot it very well but he was super fun I wasn't sure about Kelvin Johnson but Kelvin Johnson looked good seven or nine boards and seven assists which is freakishly high for him and very encouraging women Yama slow start some foul trouble was just doing that porzingis on Dallas thing where he spent all of his time outside the the three-point line as you I think  may have suggested would happen in a day with Dr a podcast but then in the fourth quarter we started mixing it up we got down low we started he started making some mid-range and and did some cool stuff made a bunch of Threes And then Devin vassell was playing on a different level than everybody else out there I felt like at least on the Spurs he had 23 54th Street assisted steals if you drafted them in Battle Fantasy I think you got to feel pretty good about yourself right now yeah I mean we have been talking about you know all the hype going to be surrounding 1B but point so hand was fun maybe we were wrong maybe it's point keldon I don't know he did have more assists but it it probably is more long term going to be points so hand I don't suspect that Calvin Johnson's going to continue to do borderline triple doubles stuff but he was like able to have that level of production that's pretty encouraging maybe a little bit more well-rounded than he's been in the past where he's just been appointed sky is that Collins aside from not giving us any threes like pretty well rounded game not as many rebounds I would have expected as well but it's only one game Devon Bissell as good as we've been talking about for a while now we've been very high on him I think a lot of people in fantasy basketball have been got paid and now it looks like he's ready to kind of take off I'm if he keeps up this level of production the Devon Bissell All Star campaigns going to start very early for me and then Wendy yes fell shovel another guy I just want to mention real quick was trade Jones a lot  yeah that's ready to drop him and I was like well he's still got to play enough minutes to provide some value 16.5 board 6 assists he showed a little bit of a 3-point shot during the preseason and showed it again last night like he wasn't known as a shooter first couple years and then has I mean added that element to his game a little bit not going to give you a ton of value from there but that makes him more dangerous on the floor will help him be on the floor and just be more productive so I was pretty excited to see him give that level of production last night as well well and he also came through with big shots and big moments in that game that game was tight all the way all the way through and Trey Jones  you know he lost starting job he could have pouted on the bench and and moved in and been you know this is not what I wanted and I'm not happy about it but he came in and he also gave them really meaningful and minutes I think  I think the Spurs are gonna be better than we think they're gonna be this year I think the Mavericks are  still  they still are probably they have problems on that team they they have some problems but I mean Luca was all world and Lively came through and Kyrie hit a huge  open three off of Luka pass and they got the win but fun game to watch cool cool that was on national TV and everybody got to see it what else we got we got you know I'm gonna do I'm gonna read this first ad and get that out of the way and it's my new favorite thing Underdog fantasy is the number one platform for NBA basketball DFS player

actually play Underdog it's fun and it's cool I like it so check it out who else we got no there's so many names to go through from last time we probably  do this all day max strus  one dimensional 3-point shooter who doesn't do anything else comes out of the heat gate with 27 points and 12 boards and a bunch of threes it was Max strus  drafted in every League do you think I don't know what his percentage of roster ship is I shouldn't looked at that  honestly I I think I may have taken him and it may have just been a mock like a late round in one draft and I think that may have been it because he has pretty one dimensional generally speaking obviously he played 39 minutes last night had 27 points 12 boards a steel in a block along with the 73's  and I don't know I guess you're pulling up his roster ship or something I am he like he's gonna play Big minutes in Cleveland but  even though he had a monster Double-Double last night I don't know that I'm ready to add him off the waiver wire I think  expecting this level of production from him consistently as gonna be asking a lot obviously the rebounds aren't going to be there with much consistency  he didn't like know Jared Allen there I guess he was able to step up a little bit to help them out there Evan Mobley wasn't as good on the glasses we may have expected I think it was more of just like a really good opportunity really good game for him but I'm not gonna buy the hype and expect him to be like he probably is I guess I shouldn't say I'm not ready to pick them up off the waiver wire because he probably is worth rostering based on playing a large role and giving you a lot of Threes but that level of production is going to be something that if you're expecting that or anywhere close that you're going to fall very short of that so if you're desperate for threes cool like he provides that spacing element to a team that felt like they had four really good players and we're just missing one piece last year like he fits perfectly I know I said that at some point during the offseason he fits that role perfectly but aside from threes you're not gonna get much else with any sort of consistency so if you played him in any sort of DFS lineup last night congrats great job but I don't know what else he's gonna give you this season other than three he's not going to come out here in average a double-double  well  I'm on my way to find out  what his ownership  or roster ship percentage is  but ESPN is decided to start kicking me out of my  login and make me log back in oh I think I'm I think I'm in so  yes I will find that in a second  see here on Yahoo is 41%  41 yeah he's available in 60% Yahoo leagues and then  in ESPN he is  a handful don't want once  it's amazing I can stream video from my house but I can't pull up pull up a website  is it really worth all this trouble to find out what Max trees is at I don't know the question of the day right there  we're gonna find out we've gone this far we can't turn back down we we need to know we're so close I'm there  12.8%  wow he has been  so max 3 I mean after that game I'm taking a flyer still in a block and 12 rebounds and to assist  and a bunch of others you know a lot of points a lot of Threes it's it's probably worth a flyer who else was good Kevin Love  13.10 boards three triples for the heat are you surprised Kevin Love is still some relevant after day one of the NBA season  necessarily surprised by it I mean we know it was going to be him or Caleb Martin starting at Power Forward at same like it kind of had a little bit of a minute split going he can still shoot obviously and he's he's rebounding was never about athleticism it was about being really good at boxing out I don't think he's weak now just cuz he's a little bit older so  it also just I mean looking at some of the numbers there was a lot of rebounds to kind of go around I mean the heat shot 40.2% is a team and the Piston shot 44.6 Stewart had 14 rebounds in that game Jimmy Butler at 13 so a lot of rebounds go around  so not super surprised I think this is probably going to be  not something we expect consistently but like probably pet Kevin Love this season he might have a game or two where he just like goes off and hits 83s because he ran randomly does that once here but pretty consistently a couple threes and decent rebounding numbers is something I think to expect so still having like having him on your roster I don't think is a bad idea  just because he'll be rather I think he'll be on the more consistent side as far as like that level of production but  because like double doubles with three threes I don't think that's something that will happen often but  you know maybe seven rebounds and a three and a half is something that he can average I'm probably not picking up  okay at least not now I'm probably not big enough of anybody right now I yeah I looked over my rosters I don't really have anybody ever I really want to drop just yet two more tht games like that I might get there the game you were at PJ Washington and 25 points Mark Williams everybody's favorite breakout Center at 13 points 15 boards three Steals and a block I don't think there's a lot to say there those guys should have been drafted almost everywhere a PJ WC sitting on your way of wire though you should probably pick him up I will say that yeah any anything to add there no Mark Williams like the stats were good but he just looked really dominant down there like Clint capela isn't a bad Center like I know he's not like nobody wants to talk like a pill in fantasy because he's kind of like that traditional Center skill set that nobody gets excited about but he's a good rebounder and a good Center and Mark Williams looked phenomenal against him so he passes the eye test as well as putting up really good numbers and then PJ Washington averaged I think about a steal on a block last year and didn't give us either in this game but still had a really good game so I expected he can and he only was one for six last night but we know he can shoot better than that so he had a good game but he can be even better than he was which is kind of crazy  um moving on to Indiana my Pacers who I'm who I've high expectations for this this season I've been predicting big things for Bruce Brown I've  told you guys and everybody else to take Bruce brown with your last your last pick or at the end of your draft Bruce Brown came through 24 points and a career high six three-pointers the Pacers won easily looked really good top to bottom buddy hield who people were worried about getting traded or being disgruntled came off the bench  and 14 points five assists four three-pointers in 25 minutes  I think but buddy hield is gonna get on board with this the Pacers just announced this morning they signed Rick Carlisle to the long term contract extension the the key pieces are in place for this team to be really really good and the next five over the next five years and they're going to be good this year there might my my super bold prediction to win the East you know if you had to make something crazy um  and prediction wise that that to me is a crazy bold prediction but anyway I'm big fan and Bruce Brown went undrafted in your league you might want to go check the way we are  definitely and Buddy hield was really good I think as I had to confirm this real quick but he's never played in the playoffs still so like the Pacers should make the playoffs this season based on  I think what everybody kind of expects like I'm expecting at least the postseason so he has a chance to do that I still gonna be playing a really big role Off the Bench not surprised at all that he seems to have kind of bought in a little bit and man everything looks good I guess when you're playing the Wizards so I guess when you have guys that are playing Washington this season make sure they're in your lineup if you're playing DFS get those guys playing the Wizards I saw someone tweet basically saying okay if you're if you're betting just take the over and every single Wizards game like I think to start the year until they make it they kind of a just a little bit it might not be a bad idea to just kind of take the over on the team that doesn't play defense but plays a lot of offense there's I mean I remember having conversations where people are saying they might average on 12500 points a game and give up one 305 well after game one kind of seems like that yeah and Jalen Smith also played limited minutes for the Pacers but he looked he looked last night like we thought he would look last year when he was the starting power forward he was very active he was all over the place and he played really well I think he's gonna earn more minutes as the season progresses if you're in a deeply I think Jaelyn Smith  should be on your watch list right now a couple other guys a manual quickly went off for 24 and 6 for the Knicks the Knicks almost full of the upset against Boston which would have been interesting  beef stew had 14 and 14 for the Pistons Jalen Duren had 17 points 14 boards for blocks that guy has come in as advertised Wiseman did not play bags was quiet with eight and eight if you drive if you somehow have Wiseman on your team he's the guy you could drop for hop free agent I think my other guy my little late season  deep pick was Denny Schroeder  over there playing point guard for the Raptors down a 22.7 assists for three pointers played a lot of minutes nobody else is playing point guard in Toronto for now  so I think that's  I think extruder Shooter's gonna be kind of fun the journeyman that just won't go away  Kobe White  kind of a rough night didn't shoot it very well he's 4 or 14 he did finish with 15 points for boards for assists two threes starting for the Bulls at point guard  didn't look as good as I wanted him to I also think there were some opening night Jitters going on there and that's think this is opening night for all these guys so you can't you can't expect them to just come out and be totally in a comfort zone so I was okay with what Kobe white did I got a lot of him a lot of invested in in Kobe White  Xavier Tillman look good for Memphis  Harrison Barnes went nuts for the Kings even though there's like 47 years old John Collins had a double-double for Utah Mountain played good  played very well for Portland Off the Bench and Bones Hyland I don't even know who bones Hyland place for Noah the Clippers he was really good Off the Bench the late game he had a big game on bench for the club I mean every time I hear bones Island I was like I can see his Denver Nuggets like in that'll never change for me it'd be locked in Forever um  and then I've got some guys who didn't do so well listed here and we've pretty much already hammered them  trade dejounte and THD so let's go on to another let's talk about Vivid Seats for a

the NBA tonight right we've got the Sixers at bucks and we've got the sons at Lakers  we do it'll be the first time we get to see the new look bucks and this Sixers team Sands James Harden there was reports that he had his bags packed and was ready to join the team and they told him to just stay home so not to question anything because there was a report that came out that said something that he was tending to his mom who was ill and like obviously we don't know for sure about that because it's a report like I'm not questioning whether that's real or not but it does seem kind of fish it that report comes out he tries to join the team and they tell him to stay home because it would seem like if that was a legit report that if he were to say hey guys I'm ready to play now that they would say yeah please if that was really like really the reason so kind of fishy there but no James Harden there's another report that came out said the Clippers are going to kind of back off on trade talks for him so if you were taking a flyer on James Harden in round four  you might have to wait a little bit longer hopefully not too much longer before we get to see him play for at least somebody hopefully somebody but I think  you know we should see big Nights from MB DeAnthony Milton Tyrese Maxey but more importantly we get to see Damian Lillard play a regular season game for the Bucs alongside the honest alongside a healthy khris Middleton which is exciting  I feel like they've done this past few years where they've had some games on opening night  and then everybody plays the next night and then we have to wait to see the Bucks in six years playing on Thursday I feel like that's happened a couple years in a row now but  I'm glad that they kind of waited for this matchup so now National TV only two games tonight and I can focus on both of those and really get to digest what's happening in the first one and as well as the Suns Lakers which if I'm not mistaken it was again and Bradley Miller helpful right Bradley Beal not gonna play  so who steps up in their place for Phoenix because that's that's the big stream  for the stream of the night is going to be whoever steps up and Bradley Beal didn't play in game one and a lot of us went with good one  a lot of us went with Grayson Allen and none of that really happened I think it was I could Gogi who actually played better than those guys  so I'm trying to figure out what's gonna happen tonight because Booker not being on the core is huge and he sort of the point guard right now so that leads me to believe good one good one maybe the guy  he might I think I mean Grayson Allen stepped into the starting unit Joshua kogi didn't expect him to do as well as he did but he had a really good game but  I don't know that I'm really it's hard to pinpoint this early in the season okay exactly who's gonna step up and play and have a really good game like somebody one or two players are probably gonna play a larger role and be more productive than we expect hard to really predict for the Suns at this point he's a full new roster and we only have one sample size of a game and are Gordon played 32 minutes Grace and started and played 21 Jordan Goodwin played 14 off the bench at imagine Goodwin Place more I wouldn't be surprised if they just moved Eric Gordon into the starting unit though based on what the minutes looked like and Jordan plays Off the Bench I think it's  I just it's gonna be a big Kevin Durant game and that's probably the only lock that you can say is that Cadiz gonna  shoot the ball a lot he shot 22 times in their last game played 37 minutes and now you're taking out Devin Booker's 21 shots I wouldn't be shocked if it was 25 or more shots from KD maybe maybe even bordering on 30 shots but also him having a little bit more of a playmaking responsibility so to get are Gordon Grayson Allen try and get them going from deep but it's hard to say exactly who's gonna step up I like to what Jordan Goodwin did with Washington last season when he was able to play a larger role and get some steals but  fingers crossed I like Jordan Goodwin but I don't know for sure if he starts I think I like him but if not then  I like I like the obvious takeaway the is gonna be a Kevin Durant game which is true because you you can't have all the big names in your FanDuel lineup tonight because  you are going to want to have Giannis You're Gonna Want to Have Joel embiid and you're like Kevin Durant's got that big bald spot on top of his head and he's old and I just don't think I want Duran but with no Beal and no Booker Durant is you have to play Duran so that's going to be that's going to be interesting to see how that goes down should be should be a pretty fun two game night we didn't even talk about the Lakers this Anthony Davis going to  get back in our good graces after that ridiculous disappearing act he pulled the other night like didn't score a point in the second half  yeah I I'd be very very surprised if Anthony Davis didn't do better against use of near kids than he did against Nicola yokich and the Nuggets however like you'll get just like he's not a horrible Defender but he's obviously more known for his offense and he's a confident Defender I'd say like pretty easily but it's Anthony Davis you're expecting him to have good games against pretty much everybody because he's that level of a player when he's on the court but I'm expecting him to bounce back after a really bad second half and a much better matchup with a Phoenix Suns team that has nurkic and they have drew Eubanks  yeah  it was better it's  it'd be pretty disappointing  Drew Eubanks  and you you a lot of your two young women she's the host of Dating Game oh no the honey  I

talking about our 30 Team league  which was  poorly thought out by me  because there's so much other stuff to talk about nobody cares about my 30 team draft at this point I wouldn't think but I will say that I am destroying my two opponents right now I'm up seven to two in both games one of them is my co-worker over to ESPN professor professor Dre  the lineup I played this week is actually not the right one because I screwed up but  so a 30 team draft I am starting dear and fox Coby white my guy Jalen Hardy did he even he didn't even come in the game for the Mavericks last night I don't think Noah so that was  that was a mistake and he's coming off an injury they said he was available he didn't even play me a while cam Thomas  cam Thomas is on my bench they had him as a questionable coming into our member they had him Luca and Dwight Powell his questionable so they were all playing and now I'm looking at it and it's saying Jaden already and play because of the illness so I remember them getting cleared oh maybe maybe you sick so I guess they cleared them and then didn't play them and said oh yeah actually they're sick which is really cool uh so I've got Darren Fox Kobe white J nari  Austin Reeves Victor woman llama Robert Covington who started last night  I think you were talking about him last week know and I was like oh I'm not falling for this Covington stuff and then I drafted him in 30 and started him I've got Zach Collins I've also got study Osman who he did not talk about who actually played pretty well off the Spurs bench as he'll do but as it's been heavily documented documented by me over the years the cheddy pill is a tough one to swallow I do have Cam Tomas on my bench I have paid for their but even with the mistake on cam Thomas I'm rolling through this league right now  hey we didn't mention scoot Henderson what did last night  Slow first half and ended up scoring 11 points wasn't great I was just watching his shot at him so before we started a lot of his scoring was done kind of in the fourth quarter on Bones Hyland kind of after the game not was the game was over but it's kind of later in the game so wasn't quite as flashy but debut for him as it was for some of the other guys but I'm not a too concerned about that it was is the Clippers they're a tough team  all right and then camera is six and two and one in each of his  two games in 30 DPS got Dame Lillard going tonight so that's pretty huge that's just that's his first pick had PJ Washington Rudy gobert who we didn't mention looked really good he looked good stat wise for Minnesota last night but he didn't play very well him and cat or funky together I could still it's still doesn't  seem like seem like it's right  anyway there's there's some 30 deep Shadow we got we got it and we contractually took care of our obligations there we go no you got anything else that  just excited basketball is back I've been just reading through all the the box scores to try and see what I should watch and just a lot of weird numbers you know like because I was starting a little bit of a Twitter thread before we started this I'm gonna finish it up after  five three players had five blocks last night five players had four and six had three blocks it's just it was crazy like Anthony like then the the Timberwolves Anthony Edwards ready go bear and Cat all had a double-digit rebounds and cotton go bear at four blocks I'm just excited for basketball to be back and all these numbers seem a lot of fun great for Fantasy Basketball  yeah it was it was pretty fun and Jared Jackson Jr had a lot of those blocks you're talking about as well  all right I'm Dr a he's no Ruben I'll be back on Tuesday with the voice of the Hawks Bob Rathbun at 11 a.m. right here on the road of wire fantasy Hoops podcast thanks for watching
