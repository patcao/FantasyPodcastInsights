welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy and FanDuel it's Friday February 9th Alex barotha here with Shannon McKeown and Ken k train Crites All Aboard for post-trade deadline Madness host trade deadline Madness get hyped grab your coffee do whatever you gotta do you know look at everyone's roster realize that Kevin Knox is a part of the Jazz and  Robin Lopez it's got traded and all this stuff let's let's go through some bigger trades we're not going to get to dialed into the draft pick minutiae and cash you know I think the Bucks acquired some cash yesterday  but yeah let's just start at the top the Knicks have the headliner  Bowie on bogdanovich and Alec Burks from Detroit and then Quinton Grimes and some other stuff goes to Detroit the Nicks are going to be missing Julius Randle for another two to three weeks OG I know be now got diagnosed with an injury that they'll cost him three to four weeks he had been out it was an elbow injury Jalen Bronson dated a day I think the hope for the next is that Randall and Anna nobe both come back in late February optimistically but don't be surprised if you know it's actually March yeah for the next this adds a bunch of scoring right this is I mean real life terms I love this move they didn't give up that much they get a scoring punch Etc but when everyone is healthy on New York  bojan's Gonna Come Off the Bench it's just gonna be in Randall The Starry lineup  you know the big Winners can but what do you think here either from a real life or from a fantasy perspective well let's face it if some Midwestern team and traded for these two whatever one be jumping up and down like yeah the Nixa plan really well and now they've got three key players hurt  and but people love East Coast bias Nick  train oh my gosh everything's fabulous like  it's this is not that huge a trading maybe this makes to the small size of the other deals made but people are jumping up and down I realize there's 100 columns the have to write a winners and losers article  but this is fine those two don't play defense so this is gonna hate them sooner or later but it's a very nice Band-Aid on a team that does need some scoring and hopefully it helps him get through what's going to be a rough month of all their stars out you you wouldn't drop Bowie on would you you have to at least wait until anovion Randall come back and then see what happens I agree Shannon yes yeah exactly but Bogey's gonna be fine until Randall and or OG returns but once that happens he's gonna be droppable but for now hold them and then you know down the stretch run find a good replacement to stream in there  Shannon what do you think's going to happen with Will Grimes in Detroit will will Grimes waiting wrong man oh will Grimes have meaningful role in Detroit I meant as in will of course of course well if I will it hard enough maybe but I actually expect crying to have a reserve role with the Pistons you know really coming off the bench and and subbing in at the two and the three spot so he'll essentially be their their sixth or seventh man right in that range Cunningham Ivy and a Sr tops and should be locked in at the one two and three moving forward for the Piston pistons in the starting lineup at least speaking of the Pistons they've got to win streak baby back-to-back wins Cornflower over the past eight one of the hottest teams wake up the bottom of the standings well you know Grimes is gonna get all those glorious Killian Hayes minutes  he could get some of those I wanted to put a compilation video of all the time recommended Killian Hayes as a free agent pickup I want two years so I would be you know at least 48 minutes viewing pleasure  I like will Grimes from a real life fit on the Pistons from a fantasy perspective I do not expect him to have a big impact yeah Clinton Grimes well we'll get into it later but he's my long shot pick but long shot okay hey Dallas made two trades yesterday Landing them PJ Washington from Charlotte and Daniel Gafford from Washington the Mavs now have a two-headed monster at center with Gafford and rookie Derek Lively was kind of lower's both of their values unless Lively's nose injury is worse than expected he has missed five games with his broken nose Alex if you heard any more injury rumors on lively  got that thing off baby no I just yes I know I think it's just it's given a lot of trouble so I you know those injuries only last so long unless it's got like like shattered shattered and I think it's just cause for me yeah yeah but so to me fantasy wise though hey now Marvin Bagley and Rashawn Holmes  are the centers for your Wizards who we know at least play a fast pace and zero defense  I think you pointed out in your column yesterday Alex the bagley's  the safe pickup and I did pick up Marvin Bagley in the league but you have always loved the permanent production of her Sean Holmes who is 30 years old  yeah look uh pick up Marvin Bagley but I am worried worried in a good way that shot holds guys start playing minutes again  he just the past two seasons for him the last two seasons ago in Sacramento he basically fell out of the rotation this year in Dallas he couldn't he couldn't latch on but those were situations where teams were trying to win and they had some other options  Washington doesn't really have other options and I think they would love to rehabilitate Rashawn Holmes value as much as possible he is 30 doesn't fit their time line but I also don't know what they're doing so yeah your recommendation is that you think Holmes is going to get extra run because Washington is is not trying to win it's pretty much that checks out yeah I think I think if you're in a 16 Team league you should at least entertain the idea of Rashawn Holmes 16 Tamar sure sure I do I think Marvin Bagley is actually the the apple of this yeah waiver wire period post-trade deadline waiver wire period he's the hottest pickup in my opinion he performed he's performed well with the Wizards coming off the bench or getting spots starts when Gafford was out Bagley is currently out with a back injury and it's already been ruled out for Friday's game but it Begley is the guy who I would want I think he's should play close to 30 minutes for game for the Wizards once he's healthy and he could be productive you know he might not be a good winning player at the NBA level but he can produce from a fantasy standpoint if he's getting that many minutes  I agree backlinks our cover guy for the Pod this week and I've got him in my pickups my waiver wire talk later but guys question for you  PJ Washington is he really a first round pick better than Grant Williams because they gave up a first round pick and William's to get Washington it's not about its Grant Williams it's his contract really everybody hates him and his contract deal but it's a year longer he's worse  did PJ Washington is significantly better than Grant Williams I actually am probably one of the few we can't talk about PJ Washington in a waiver wire segment because he's too heavily rostered set over 70% I think that should be pushed up higher because of this trade I am one of the few pundits who believed his value will increase from the fantasy side with the move to Dallas people so I've seen some claimed as more competition for minutes with Dallas I do not believe that's the case at all he was the backup to Miles bridges in Charlotte whereas in Dallas he should be the starting power forward as soon as he's ready they have he's competing for minutes with basically Maximilian Cleaver Derek Jones Josh Green is going to start at the three  give me PJ Washington I think he's got a start he'll be you know 14 points 67 rebounds and get you those steel or I'm sorry the blocks and three-pointers from the four position which is really what has buoyed his fantasy value for the past couple years anyways  I was a big PJ Washington fan not this past summer but the prior summer when Bridges was going to be out for the year and I thought Washington's Really Gonna own the starting four spot for hornets and frankly he never did grab the bull by the horns he wound up getting sent back to the bench  I I fell a little burned on Washington last season  I don't know we'll see I think it's gonna I think they're gonna they're gonna I might see some Gafford at power forward I think it's gonna be a the others are always gonna be a mess in Dallas PJ Washington scored 43 points in an NBA game less than two weeks ago he  he's good he's significantly better than Grant Williams all right well wonderful Shannon take us to the news out of Oklahoma City  all right okay see Thunder add Gordon Hayward Hayward spent out since Heber 26th he was questionable on Wednesday which was an upgrade when healthy he'll probably come off the bench for OKC he's really the only meaningful veteran on this roster SGA remember I mean he seems like he's been around forever and he kind of has but he's only 25 so this is you know a good veteran presents add some composure to this team further playoff run  Alex  when do you think Heyward is gonna return to the court so he was actually questionable for the Hornets previous game before being ruled out so I wouldn't be surprised if he's back before the All-Star break  okay nice and where do we see him sliding in for the Thunder you know right now they're going with the starting lineup of SGA giddy door Jalen Williams Chet Holmgren does he push giddy or dirt out of that starting lineup or is he gonna be coming off the bench  so  I think he'll come off the bench to start or to begin I should say Come Off the Bench that's right they'll come off the bench um but I won't be surprised if he steals minutes from namely like Aaron Wiggins but then I could see him closing games over Josh Kitty exactly exactly and Dort look Doris up and down his minutes are up and down sometimes they don't need them for his defense he'll get in trouble whatever  so they love defense they do love his defense and yeah hey words not a Lockdown Defender  no he's not and of course getting traded does not fix his injury issues I wrote that my article it doesn't fix what's going on with Hayward but I would be I would be shocked  I shouldn't say shock I think you'll play about 24 to 28 minutes most nights but could push into the 30s in certain situations  you know I like this move for OKC they did need a veteran as you pointed out Shannon they don't really have a better on the squad and it came at a really low cost I think it's a few second round picks and they've got a ton of salary room on this squad so there's plenty money wise it's not a problem at all my only kind of minor complaint is it's not like  Gordon has a ton of playoffs success he might be a shell shocked as these kids once playoff intensity kicks in because I don't I like to see I should look up how many playoff games but he never had a run with the Jazz he wasn't healthy for the Celtics playoffs stuff don't you remember that playing with Charlotte that beautiful composed Ronnie had to the final four right didn't they make the final four thanks so he was he was great he was great that was many go it's a college Bible for you yeah it is good though I like the fact you know you bring in a mentor for giddy who definitely should not be in a mentor role himself so I like I like the move for okay see yeah Alex take us to Philadelphia oh yes Philly Agatha buddy hield from the Pacers who Pacers gave up furkan Cork Mass so rest in peace the cork mazaro one of the last you know signs of the processes is finally left the building yeah I just  the buddy hield is going to I don't think he's gonna see that much more minutes or usage than he was in Indiana maybe at first because the Anthony Melton is still out but you know when when Melton's healthy when Bethune is healthy  I don't 100% know what they're going to do with their starting five  I think I think Buddy hield is going to continue to play about like 26 to 28 minutes a game he's gonna add to the erratic results of Kelly oubre here you know what I mean like  Kelly is a gunner couldn't always trust him some  three for 16 nights  and now you got you you never like who's gonna be hot and just keep shooting I don't think he can have both of them on the court together too much to just kind of redundant but I I actually told my Philadelphia fan here in Vermont when they made that hardened deal I said they're going to use these assets to get buddy heel to the trade deadline and then they did actually didn't have to use any of the assets they got in that hardened trade they were able to get healed for second round picks so frankly he was a nice cheap move for Philly  what assets they got assets for herding I believe that buddy hield much like PJ Washington I think this trade will increase buddy heels value I believe he will eventually start for the Philadelphia 76ers it might not be the first couple games but this is a team that's rolling out Nicholas Batum and the starting lineup that doesn't need to happen you can slide to buy Sarah's over to the four have buddy heels start at the three you could even start buddy Heald over melting and have melted in return to that back up role that he strived and for many many years so I actually think Buddy hield will eventually start see more consistent playing time and as a result have more consistent production than he did in Indiana the season Indiana never really settled on a rotation Carlisle is experimenting left and right yeah um we had some other smaller deals the Schroeder Dinwiddie swap which gave me a migraine Dinwiddie then got waived Toronto guy oh tribology and Kelly Olynyk Tillman went to Boston Detroit gets fontecchio just undefeated in the fontecchio era  that's true but you did you wave Gallinari  yeah yeah those two hanging out with their own Espresso Bar in the Piston locker room you know he had that much cheese Mo Italian cheese Mo and Loverboy you don't have one in the room you know I have one yeah it's like they're gonna have a plan on the stereo system zucrow by the way is the Italian Elton John  yeah it's like you know some teams get guys from some guys from clutch Sports some guys like guys from certain colleges I thought the was going to put together the Italian national team what are the great tracksuits hanging out  Little Caesars that's bad news all right well time to talk about our

this is the ever-growing popular segment of the site where our beloved fans usually through YouTube maybe the Twitter's I don't know we're on tiktok with us I can't tell  ask us fabulous questions that we answer them live we're going to start with Paul Paul wants to know he drops so Han for GG Jackson of your Memphis Grizzlies  was this a good move  I don't hate it so hot you know last three games for him he's been pretty down he's played better since moving to the bench but he's still been fairly up and down GG Jackson just got signed to a four-year contract  off of a two-way deal  and yes he is also inconsistent in his own way but has shown some stuff for the Grizzlies lately I think this is kind of League dependent  I think Sohan might end up being a better category League player Jackson could end up being a better points League guy because Jackson could be empty on blocks deals like he's just a gunner right yeah yeah I mean I agree I would go GG Jackson he had a big 27.9 rebound performance last night against the Bulls you know over the past three games he's averaging 20.3 points seven rebounds 1.3 Steals and three three-pointers he'll go percentage is gonna be a problem you had a three Fourteen and four  an issue is so hot too though right oh absolutely yeah yeah so on definitely has the some efficiency issues as well but Gigi I love his upside for their mayor of the season they obviously believed in him after giving that four year deal trading way David Roddy to kind of clear some more minutes for him as well I wouldn't be surprised if Memphis sits even more folks like aldama or you know Triple J down the stretch and Gigi is truly Unleashed all right here's one more let's come from Noble by the twitters he just dropped Kelly the clinic Olynyk for Andre Drummond in a 14 team category league is this a good or bad move fellas  I don't mind this because we're seeing some  alarming things out of Chicago  Drummond started next to vujevich the other night played 35 minutes when for 16 16 with four blocks came off the bench against Memphis 31 minutes 21 thirteen one one and one uh yeah I look Drummond if Drummond played a guaranteed 20 minutes a game he would be a musk roster player if he's gonna start playing 30 minutes a game this is like you gotta add them in like every League like 10 team points anything so yes I'm fine with this 14 team cat he is worth an ad you know the one one caution to win that I'll throw out there is Memphis essentially we're gonna round up and say I'll seven footer he's six eleven both Memphis and Minnesota started 27 Footers or six 10 plus players in their front court against the Bulls so that opened up the opportunity that's why Drummond receding just received the spot start going against Minnesota's twin towers and then he played 30 plus minutes plus I mean the Bulls haven't made any roster or any trades at least in like two and a half years or something insane it might be a little bit longer than that they basically  are running like six guys right now until that Williams gets back so drumming by default should get pretty solid minutes and we already saw you know in the webinars that he seen earlier this season or for over the course the entirety Tire season 16 minutes per and he's already grabbing eight and a half boards and 1.1 steals I expect the minutes in the production to be up for at least the next handful of games  all right Falls in one last question this one from Peter let's come to rephrase this a little Ben mathurin are also to soon move of Chicago  he's saying are they still holds but let's say which of those two do you prefer rest of season  both of them are still a hold math and is interesting now that heel is gone  I think you know maybe he starts playing 30 minutes more consistently I think they have similar upside but to soon mood does stuff other than score points specially on defense that matters not going to do  so um if you need defensive stats I would lean to soon move if you're more offensively leaning I will go math and  well I'll talk about Ben Math More in our waiver way or period but that's where I'm leaning to sumo's fine but he is the player if there is anyone who's been impacted by drum and seeing increased run it's assumed to Sumo played 39 minutes three games in a row and tell Drummond was Unleashed and he's dropped below 30 minutes each of the past two games 29 and 27 he is awesome the player that moved to the bench when Drummond receive that spot star against Minnesota so I like Ben math quite a bit just because he's a dude who can go out there and score 30 points at any given night it's this this this Bowl's Twin Towers line up is  its kind of reminded me the Detroit Pistons a little Jalen Duren Isaiah Stewart Little Andre Drummond Nicolas vujevich Isaiah Stewart's like six eight Maybe  all right well that's it for the fan feedback Alex take us to the big money segments yes the way for wire so for our games next week just a heads up that you gotta be checking your schedule for whatever  site League you play in because we're dealing with the All-Star break coming up soon so you know from February 12th which is Monday February 19th only a handful of teams five in fact play three games  everyone else please too except the Oklahoma City Thunder who played one loan game and despite that Ken  I'm recommending you pick up Gordon Hayward this is a little maybe a little counterintuitive you know Hayward I should say the main thing here Hayward expected to return soon he got dropped in a lot of leaks yeah and as I mentioned at the top it 32 minutes per game this season he's averaging 15 5 and 5 I think there's a strong chance he takes money from Aaron Wiggins I think he could close over Josh giddey Lou Dort here and there might miss some time this is not like a major priority add because he is still injury-prone he will probably come off the bench all that's gonna have some resting games that's just like Hayward injury wrist yeah if you're the thing is if you're in like a i 12 teams you know there's gonna be a lot of other options out there for you but if you're in a 14 team leader 16 Team league I supposedly if you're in Fab if you have a Fab situation and you got nine waiver wire options you're trying to pick up you know eight dollars three dollars two dollars throw Gordon Hayward at the end of that and just see if you know you can pick him up if you if you absolutely need  a boost  can or you going with I have an unusual suggestion as a supposed to an actual name I'm just saying the whole gaggle of Memphis Grizzlies just throw a dart at somebody Santi aldama GG Jackson Scotty Pippin or even Jacob Gilyard they're all rostered 7 to 24 percent Memphis has no one healthy they just dumped Robbie and Tilghman  I mean they just they gave Gigi Jackson a contract a little after they gave Vince William a real contract just throw a dart at this Skeleton Crew somebody's gonna be someone's Gonna Shine but I'd be lying if I said I knew Vince Williams should be long gone but check for him he's he's rostered in 64 percent so a third League's you can still get Vince Williams gonna be awesome do you two have any preferences in this gaggle of Grizzlies  oh boy um well I could tell you in the last 10 games Vince Williams per game followed by Jared Jackson that sounds y'all dama who we know is solid when he gets the minutes so I would say I'll damaja is actually after that yeah I'm actually a major preferences know but I think the order of the minutes per game is not bad I my preference is to not touch John conchar with and any length of full but give me fat give me Santee Santy Claus give me Gigi Jackson give me Scotty Pippen Jr I like Scotty Pippen Jr more than gillyard start got the start exactly me yeah Scotty Pippin's been Scottie Pippen Jr has been very solid when he gets plenty time it's been like every other game is the interesting part but over the past four contests he started that he's played in he has started three of those four games and he is top 300 fantasy points in each of those four games if he sticks in the starting lineup I think he's absolutely worth the look you know and this reminds me so much of when the Houston Astros tanked and they uncovered Jose Altuve at second base as a gem that if they were not tanking Altuve they never would have gotten the ads to show what you know a star could be I'm not saying they're going to find an MVP but the Grizzlies are going to uncover some gems I think so cheap gems whether it's  William's words Jackson or its Pippin but I love reading their box scores and they're going to uncover some gems for when they're competitive imagine how cool l2a would look on an NBA basketball okay cat I want to give you I'll give you a quick pop quiz you have no reason to know the answer to this how many players do you think have gotten at least one start for the Memphis Grizzlies this season oh I'm gonna say 1 6 1 7  23  can you were pretty much right it's 18 players have started oh Grizzlies this year and 13 sorry 14 have started at least seven games oh 11 have started at least 10 games so how do you how many years  Juniors Jared Jackson Jr Vince Williams Junior Scotty Pippen Jr Kenneth Lofton Junior oh yeah and Austin yeah GG Jackson the second and then honorable mention Xavier Tillman senior yeah I love  a guy who  five looking 45 year old David Tillman he doesn't have that he's just he's just born a senior you  came out with that bearded receiving he says his own he is his own dad he's a junior and a senior who is your daddy I am um that's the top research right there Alex God that's there's your money we should just close the pod on that they're not gonna do any better but that said Shannon give us your  top waiver wire pick of the week yeah bennedict mathurin for the Indiana Pacers he yeah with Buddy hield gone that should open up playing time for bed Matthews 52% rostered on Yahoo we've seen the way Ben math can perform when he gets hot his per 36 numbers are solid this year very comparable to his rookie season 20.4 points 5.3 rebounds 2.7 to assist not much on the defense then but a salad 45 and 83% for the percentages and he's also hitting 1.83 pointers and and that again that's per 36 I do not expect him to get 36 minutes per game but there is a chance you know they're either going to keep him in a reserve role haven't been the sixth man having been that microwave that Vinnie Johnson Off the Bench or he could easily replace Andrew nem hard in the starting lineup and probably should he's definitely the better player between the two but I went be surprised if from this date forward been math is the third leading scorer behind bi behind Halliburton and seacom for the remainder of the season passing Myles Turner you know I think nembhard will be starter in name only meaning yeah you know people will shy away from Africa is not starting but Catherine will have more minutes more importantly the neb hard regardless of who starts yeah they don't they don't need more offense in that in that starting lineup exactly it does really need defense all right who is your second pick up and you could have done this as your long shot but no no you had the colonies to make him a regular pick I basically got two long shots I will say our our friend and co-worker Ryan said who had the hose Altuve reference on their bingo card most of my bingo card for Ken is HR violations so very few player names HR violations in 70s NBA players who played for the bullets  West on sale the references stuff like that Hayes yeah Run field I just made up maybe Jeff rule of the good job that was 80 oh man well there's another guy who is not from the 80s taeler Hendrix who was probably born in 2001 yes Hendricks of the Utah Jazz 3% roster right now this is a deeply suggestion gesture and wake Kelly Olynyk and Simone fontecchio in the wake of that Hendrix played 18 minutes last night yes he only scored three points he took at least he took five shots you know not bad maybe he can score eight next time eight rebounds one assist and one block per 36 though for Hendricks 12 points seven rebounds 1.3 steals 2.43 2.9 stocks stocks are special interesting for those in category leagues the whole peers that he could start shooting better than you know 38 3575 from the field but if you're in a deep league and again you're kind of throwing darts at the wall maybe some late season Shenanigans and March for the Jazz you know they spent a pretty high pick on Hendricks I forget exactly what it was but it was a high lottery pick or a mid-line we need to give his minutes to Kevin Knox or Luca simonik you know the actual G League power forward no no  play Hendricks he's like 12 years old though they a little concerned that his young age we did yeah 9th overall pick yeah he was born November 22nd 2003 in Fort Lauderdale all those are as a one other one other note from that Utah game is Walker Kessler started at Center they went big started Kessler John Collins marking in and you know so Kessler Kessler stands Rejoice 10 points nine rebounds six stocks Yeah Yeah Yeahs Kessler manager should be ecstatic with this trade yes okay well I'm gonna go with who at one point Shannon said was the top  trade deadline fantasy winner / waiver wire pickup and that is Marvin money backs Bagley in Washington he's got to be the starting center now that Daniel gaffords in Detroit admittedly backley is hurt won't play this weekend but it's not a big time injury right Shannon all right Alex  Bagley yeah so I was looking up I was looking up badly stuff 28 that's a 2819 all rookie selection Marvin Bagley to you by the way I force straight absences I he partially participated in Tuesday's practice before being ruled out Wednesday and then Friday so he's on his way back he's on his way back look per 36 this season and that's split between Detroit and Washington 21 points 10 rebounds 1.4 stocks while shooting 52% from the field it's not a good free throw shooter at 69% but you kind of expect your centers to have poor a free presentation look this Washington team is terrible they don't play any defense Marvin was going to get a ton of offensive possessions I don't know why they didn't deal Tires Jones that's a whole other topic for the wizards but Bagley is going to get a crazy amount of touches crazy amount of minutes maybe Rashawn Holmes pushes on but there's plenty minutes on the Scott Off full squad for both of them I think Marvin Bagley is a really nice upside waiver wire pickup right now I don't there's there's no where you can wage right but I wish I could wage her on will Marvin Bagley score  a career high points at some point with the Washington Wizards yes  yes his career high right now is 32 points and I he's got you will have a cold one night or just stopped caring or go to a fashion show and badly will get 33  fashion  she's always doing any fashion stuff like come on play the ball play the game all right Shannon who's your second pick up I like it I like it a lot a star Thompson defensive wizard for the Detroit Pistons he started to games in a row back-to-back games both wins for the Detroit Pistons have I mentioned that yet this episode 27 is double digit wins they're sniffing double-digit wins for the season 27 and 28 minutes in those two games with averages of 9 points five and a half rebounds 1.5 steals nothing to get too excited about all right we know he has some problems shooting the ball he's 63% from the from the free throw line 40 48% from the from the field which is actually pretty solid but only 15% from downtown the three-point shot will continue to be a struggle but if he is truly Unleashed and playing 27 28 to 30 minutes for game for Monty Williams we're going to see solid defensive production from as our tops and so if you need defense that is one of the key areas where he will be able to contribute for your fantasy team you know it does remain to be seen how this team is going to integrate find heo and Austin Grimm so I do expect both of those players those are the two trade deadline Acquisitions that I expect Detroit to work into the rotation I don't believe that we're going to see Troy Brown EV  yeah Malachi Flynn gets too much run for this team and but hopefully hopefully with fantastic fantasio and Grimes they don't unseat Thompson you know we have muscala banished to the bench to never return we'll see I can't trust anything that Monty does but you have to assume he's gonna he's gonna just roll tops now out there and starting lineup for the rest of the season the Fournier gets minutes and why they have a bottom out already I don't know if fortnite gets minutes piston fans should just boycott the arena they should just refuse to go I think there may be already doing that but that would be an atrocity sidebar you and I were slacking yesterday about Jaden Ivey really should get a ton of minutes in fact play until his knees bleed well he did play 40 minutes last night that over time W over the Blazers 408 I was kidding a little with the bleeding knees but amazing comeback win amazing come back when the game before Ivy had 19 points in the fourth quarter  yeah and VP chance will start ringing out  and LCA how many fans were in the arena in Portland for that classic Pistons Trail Blazers matchups I could probably tell you if you give me a minute what was I was gonna say something he's Alex you were going to stay in Detroit yeah attendance 18,125 that is a lie like ladies and gentlemen is Portland is a good place to watch a game that's and they do butts in the seats the Portland Phil's up every time no matter how good or bad that team is  I've you know maybe it's just like a true match show situation Marcus Sasser Detroit Pistons 11% roster  Detroit last night played 38 minutes 17 points 11 assists and two steals we're going to talk about grinds a little bit we yeah a little bit later very soon find heck yo those guys I think they're going to see  meaningful minutes but I don't think either like guaranteed 30 a night I just think there's room here for sasseur to see 20 minutes again regularly you got I mean given what he's shown it would make sense like he is a much better passer that I think people anticipate he's not just like a spark plug scored he's not Camp Thomas he can pass and he also has shown some stuff on defense despite being under size so yeah I hope I get some run down the stretch Sasser has upside and frankly I like him better than who I put in my long shot which is sad because I got to pick first being on Eastern Time but I'll also stay in Detroit for my Longshot I want to I think Quentin Grimes is gonna get a ton of run as well you see Sasser and Grimes coming off the bench a lot I think Grimes is gonna get 20 to 25 minutes a night he played 30 minutes a game last season for the next was it all that great though a little 11 points 2.23 1.1 stocks a game but probably should have more usage with the Pistons  but I guess I am also raising my hand for the Detroit back court for my long shot but yeah Sasser or Grimes could be interesting  yeah I think Grimes he's mostly just a three-point specialist so  yeah but category League yeah you need that well let's go to Shannon's long shot pick who a name that I've been pestering you to up his rest of season projections a little but maybe post trade now you proved correct Alex but go for it yeah Josh Green for the Dallas Mavericks I was amazed to see that he's only 21% rostered he has been on quite a tear over the past week he is averaging 16.8 points 5.8 rebounds 3.3 assists and three steals in 33 minutes per he has been a lock in the starting lineup since January 3rd he has started all 17 of his appearances have been as a member of the starting five for Dallas he had one dnp which I believe he was injured or sick for that game but over that 17 game stretch  31 and a half minutes per 12.2 points 4.2 rebounds 1.93 pointers Dallas believes in Josh Green I I can't say I have as much faith in him as as they do but you know there are plenty of Rumours with PJ Washington going to Dallas prior to the deadline and Charlotte apparently wanted Josh Green for and a lesser less heavily protected first round pick and Josh Green for Washington and that's that's the true reason why that Dallas pick is only top two protected is because they had to sacrifice that those protections to not include Josh Green in the deal to me that's clear sign Joshua's going to stick in the starting lineup I don't think they're going to start Derek Jones over him like I said I do believe PJ Washington will start at the four Josh Green should be locked in as Dallas is starting small forward he's a good three he's a 3-point specialist for the most part he can't get you some defensive stats and not great but solid sole  percentage is from the floor free throws dicey doesn't take a lot of those but if you need some scoring and 3-point shooting he's worth a look you mentioned percentages actually he's been on a great heat of the last 10 games 52% from the field and 85% from the charity stripe the last June games he's figured something out I think he could be that ideal catch and shoot guy that Luca and Kyrie need the shot clock is dwindling down hi yes he's hot he's gonna shoot a little less hot but he's basically like a 5040 guy so um yeah  we'll see  any drops I mean guys other than the rooster Gallinari anybody Killian Hayes anybody we're we're not we're not Derek Lively  that's kind of a bummer Gafford showing up cards both those guys  I think it does hurt both of those guys I don't think they're going to be drops but shallower league if you're gonna attend team emergency unfortunately you might have to keep an eye on it  drops I I don't think there's like any immediate drops I mean maybe didn't witty actually you might want to you might want to get sick or dropping dead when he's not on an MBA roster currently I guess the concern would be that he signed somewhere and starts playing like 26 minutes off the bench but  you know if he has to be sacrificed for you to get a really strong waiver pickup and I think you can probably go ahead and do that  and there's some other guys who says like we just don't know like Dennis Schroder is he gonna play a 34 minutes for Brooklyn or is he gonna play 24 minutes for Brooklyn ah we don't know about like olenek is Ola get bought out is he going to start playing 15 minutes is he got maybe he's a pickup it's just it's there's some stuff that's still kind of unclear so  I think that  is a general overview of what's going on all right well that's the end of our waiver wire segment let's talk FDF or DFS sponsor good friends and FanDuel yes FanDuel who sponsors are Friday

and Alex  there are six games today and we have the highest over under and Atlanta at Philly 243 almost more than any point in the season any individual date you gotta check the lineups today you got to check the injuries guys got traded they got moved guys are sitting out soles on like who can play right away and who can't on these trades like like fontecchio for some reason he's like got a you have to go back to the border and hang out just go back to Italy and physical there it's a whole thing I mean Nick and I were talking I came and believe they were games yesterday and there were nine I mean it's like what are we doing why are they deadline that is a little crazy they used to have it closer the All-Star break but then the Sidetrack the All-Star break so they said we need to and we need to have this deadline before the All-Star break but I agree they should it should be a  game free slate on the on the trade deadline that would be fantastic and the day after just two days and then push the season back or start two days early like why are we anyway he don't get me started I'll be my young man they'll be my young man rant on these podcasts okay so on this slate  it's it's small enough where I can just quickly run through the games here it just in terms of who's actually playing it Lana at Philly Washington at Boston Houston at Toronto Charlotte at Milwaukee Denver at Sacramento New Orleans at the Lakers Shannon where you turning first I mean that that Atlanta Philly game is like you mentioned highest over under of the night and there's a lot of intriguing options in that game as well dejounte Murray you know is questionable so keep an eye on that bogdanovich will likely start in his place if Murray sits capella out which means it's another okongwu spot start and that makes him a solid option on both DraftKings and FanDuel 7100 on FanDuel and he is it 6200 on DraftKings so quite a bit more value in play there with the the draft with DraftKings I also love the fact that on both sides he is Center power forward eligible just provide some flexibility there  on the other side and also let me say if Marie sits Jalen Johnson just absolute Terror he's been awesome in two games against Philly earlier this season he is averaging 53 and a half fantasy points I expect him you know especially from Murray's out he'll have to shoulder more of a load but the other side the Philadelphia side I think I think we might see some Paul Reed hate um he's really underperformed since Stephanie is starting lineup but that's mainly due to an illness that held him back for a couple games and he only played 15 in 22 minutes while being under the weather against Golden State on Wednesday night he played 31 minutes finished with 30 fantasy points six six points eight rebounds for assists two blocks two steals I love his defensive upside  give me some Paul Reed 5800 on FanDuel and 65 let's see yes 65 on FanDuel and 58 on DraftKings sorry  yeah this the early portion of the Slate features some teams that I'm like today do they even care anymore right Atlanta do they even care anymore like he does he care yeah Washington against Boston do they care anymore Toronto do they really care anymore Charlotte against Milwaukee do they care so not bad teams to Target Boston by the way  17 point favorites over the Washington Wizards though I think there's you know I know they put a game time tag on table and I know we're confident we're gonna play  I think that's  that's my big time to rest our yeah lead dog I I don't know if we need that green color by Tatum's name I would put I'd Switched at the gray because I see them conveniently letting Jason rest tonight  yes go ahead sticking with that game though the interesting part for me is actually mentioned earlier Marvin bagley's out Rashawn Holmes to be determined if he's even gonna be available after being traded to the Wizards that yesterday so what will the Wizards do at Center is one of the big question marks for DFS are they going to go with a small lineup move kuzma up to the five plugging Kula Bali or someone like that into the starting five I think that's probably the most likely scenario you know they cannot two-way guy Eugene Omari yeah he's like not a real Center he really oh that's crazy oh this is like a Chuck Haze situation I even realized that he was only six foot six he is I did get the yeah I was blessed with watching play for the Pistons a little bit last season he is undersized from a vertical standpoint but he is he is a legit man and can Beef It Up with anyone down in the post hey I actually got a good DFS question in the chat  asking if in Atlanta is a cone to chalky to play in tonight's DFS I'm looking all these other studs centers we got some bonus going against yokich tonight obviously Anthony Davis the Lakers  is a cone with two Chucky to play in DFS tonight guys  so that's a tough question because  there could be so much value on this slate that opens up that I think roster distribution could be fairly wide at the same time at the center spot  I think a lot of people will turn to him specifically but Shannon also mentioned she's playable a power forward I don't know sharing maybe that's maybe that's more of a question for you I do think the Dual position eligibility will actually keep his you know there are tons of centers available that are solid options tonight but because the Dual position eligibility I do think he will be chalky but again I mean there are plenty there are plenty of intriguing options where you can have a guy who might be rostered and 35 40% of rosters in your lineup and and counter that with two three percent roster players as well to really offset that chalkiness so I'm not too worried about his roster percentage for tonight's sleep  we should also mention pushing along the game's here Houston versus Toronto very healthy their artists healthy they've been lately but Houston know Fred Van Fleet still a Christian up to 7200 on FanDuel on the back of a 13.13 rebound six assists three block performance two games before and only 24 minutes he went for 1974 to steals like a block at 7200 against the slower-paced Raptors are you interested in playing Tom and Toms and at that salary Shannon that that and that 40 Point fantasy outing in 24 minutes that you mentioned that was against the same Toronto team just a week ago I I do still like him s7200 which probably yeah I thought there was no way I would plug him into my lineup when I saw how much he was on FanDuel but I think there's upside where he plays you know 35 or more minutes and and not only eclipses 40 fancy points like he has two of the last three games but approaches 50 so I think he is worth that option he hasn't really put together the complete game where he you know 13 rebounds fantastic 13 points he could score more than 13 points in a game and he can dish out more than six assists as well he's just so good on the defensive end like his brother where he can pick up those Steals and blocks that I still like him at 7200 on DraftKings he's only 5800 he or I'm sorry 5300 his roster percentage on DraftKings I believe I believe in the most recent spot start for Freddie Van Fleet he was 70 right over 70% rostered I expect that again on DraftKings tonight  I mentioned the Charlotte Milwaukee again Milwaukee minus 14 and a half at home Jamie and Lillard and Chris Middleton are both questionable that's something to keep in mind you know last night I just I feel like I need to bring this up last night Middleton was out for the Bucs and Lillard did not play  and the Box were only 2 point underdogs to the Minnesota Timberwolves why they got smacked by the way 129 to 105 they should yeah what do you talk about anyway Charlotte obviously they're missing PJ Washington now there's gonna be some value presumably opens up on Charlotte kogi kogi Martin's looked interesting Alex let's use this Milwaukee spread issue to plug the NBA picks we drink column on RotoWire where I do think you should you should dabble a little more into the spread for bucks games you're good picking bucks problems well it's pretty easy because they are the third worst team against the spread in the entire league and I always say bet against them so I mean that's my that's my blanket advice if you're like should I should you spread tonight the other side yes absolutely yes anyway um yeah Shannon I mean let's let's I don't want to spend too much we've gone over an hour already there are three games left on this slate I think a lot of people might actually end up ignoring the Denver Sacramento game maybe that makes like a gpp you know kind of interesting spot but what are you looking at here at the final three games yeah one thing to watch with the Denver Sacramento game is Denver played last night you know second game of back-to-back it's possible you know Jamal Murray yolk at someone sits on the Denver side the Charlotte Milwaukee side I well I don't expect Milwaukee to get spanked by Charlotte but I I do I do think there's some intriguing options on the Charlotte side I would not buy into the big performance Cody Martin had and Cody Martin also is he's expected to play but he's listening he's listening is probable with the knee injury for tonight he had 42 fantasy points in the most recent game against Toronto played 28 minutes 19 points five rebounds 8 assists yeah he scored a lot of those points early in the game I don't believe that he's going to repeat and have another 40  fan fancy Point outing even in 30 plus minutes he typically doesn't do that but you know Brandon Miller absolutely I got like a lot for this late even though he's in that mid seven thousand dollar range Nick Richards Nick Richards I never picked the right game for Nick Richards Watson cheap for the Nuggets I think he could get big minutes tonight on the second of a back-to-back that game went all the way to the last 30 seconds but our last minute against the Lakers last night love to see Denver to shut down the Lakers was great but Aaron Gordon was having a bang LeBron all day I could see Watson getting some big minutes tonight there's yeah I mean I  I would pay money to watch Aaron bank with brown again tonight Peyton Watson has been very solid for the day he like any any his roles consistent he seen 20 plus minutes and like six seven games in a row 25 minutes last night the production kind of total popes been hurt so that's helped opened up some minutes I know I don't know if I'm paying 5200 on FanDuel for him though when there's someone other oh no on the slave I was I was hoping he was cheaper for 4200 on DraftKings so he is an option especially if Denver arrests someone I like him more when his usage is just going to be increased because one of the regulars the city  yeah before we wrap this up I will just mention this last game we didn't touch on it but Zions questionable values his questionable LeBron's questionable Anthony Davis this questionable so kind of a toss up your guys are gonna have to check that one on your own um but that that wraps things up for us before Shannon's know Ken's somebody has to rant somebody I got a rant I got a I got a rant cute up Ark Chicago Bulls what is wrong with you stop sitting on your inept hands and do something the Bulls are 25 and 27 27 9th in the East and destined for playing status with the old man Duo of DeMar DeRozan and Nicholas Busch this team is going nowhere yet held on to DeRozan whose 34 Lucius who's 33 and Andre Drummond an old 30  at the trade deadline didn't move any of them did nothing at the deadline Drummond and DeRozan will be free agents at the end of the season which means they're both gonna walk for nothing much can't play defense Patrick Williams is a restricted free agent that wants to leave and he stinks teams were dying for Alex Caruso and his chief contract yet check cargo did nothing enjoy your time Chicago in the mediocre pit of despair where you will reside for years to come I completely agree with you Ken I mentioned on the the RotoWire XM NBA Show on Sirius XM MBA radio with Nick the Shameless plug yesterday that I'm worried that this Kobe White emergency has actually tricked the Bulls and the thinking no this is he's out he's Lonzo ball now we wanted this Lonzo ball Levine DeRose and much thing and the problem was we were missing lawn so but now we have him again his name is Colby white so we're gonna win 50 games next year lonzo's never been this kid  that's not take that is true that is true actually you could have coupled Caruso to get to rosin off your books people were clamoring everyone was mentioning Drummond is a great backup center I don't know why drama's not in Philly frankly there had to be deals Chicago could have made I don't understand them sitting Pat  I've taken that stance and keep release before where you know I could pick up a worthless Dynasty late round pick but instead I just want to stick it to those other those other owners because I feel like they're offers are garbage so it's pretty clear that's what Chicago did they said we don't need all these second round picks from you we're just gonna hold on to our guys and watch you so old men and watch him walk at the end of the season that'll be great yeah oh man um okay mispronounced names section I think we well we had like a will Grime snafu oh will as it will yes Grimes get minutes and I misread it as will instead of Quentin Grimes is certainly Quentin Grimes but now it's not on mispronounced names so thank you everybody for joining us on the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast presented by Underdog fantasy and FanDuel Ken take us out of
