hey everybody I'm Steve Alexander Dr a welcome to the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast today's Thursday April 11th  Rick camo is here to talk about Hoops as we do every single Thursday and this is our last Thursday of the regular season  yo what's up everybody it is Dr Ray fswa Hall of Famer Steve Alexander I'm Rick Campbell the fantasy free and we are here this is championship week last week should have been championship week for your league but there are leaks that are playing their championship week this week um you know I'll go time right with rest shut down Yana's going out um no this isn't it you don't you don't play your championship game this week so doc look my business is all but taking care of and fantasy basketball except for one League um it's a how many teams in the league it's a 16 Team league closing in another on another championship here I'm liking how the the points are stacked in here heading into the final three days but the rest of my League's Docker in the rear view mirror the dust has been settled I have a very very very very good story to tell you and the people about that but I want you to start us off here how did you win 30 deep for the second time and you are now one chip away from the doctorate Dynasty and 30 deep  well I I drafted Victor women Yama with the 25th pick  honestly that's how I won the first year that I won was 2011 / 2012  and that was when I picked up Lynn sanity two days before Lynn sanity happened  took you out in the finals in that one and that  that's a tough one dude that was that's that was tough um  this one I took out best and best Bruce and thank goodness we're not playing this week because Victor women Yama is probably done for the year  I'm down 06 and tied in three right now if we went up having to play this week out and it mattered I don't know that I would have held on but I had an incredible draft I went wimble number one I took Fox with my Darren Fox with my second round pick Austin Reeves was my third rounder somewhere in there I picked up Kobe white and cam Thomas  and  Payton Pritchard was huge for me all year so I decided to really  healthy and fun Year and that in 30 deep man if you can stay healthy and you can put six or seven guys out there play a lot of minutes you're gonna do well it's just finding six or seven guys to put out there  every night that can get it done is that columns when when we wasn't playing that song was doing well so those two kind of  pivoted off each other but I I'm so thankful to to get a second 30 deep title  talk to Ray congratulations man that's big  a lot of the guys that win the title in 30 deep they put that in the name of their team 2017 champ 2019 champ whatever it is it's that big of a deal I still have not won this ship yet I am about to dock here shortly now I don't know if it's today or whenever I'm about to pin My Little Queen to have 30 deep change from a weekly lead to a daily League because it's no longer 1994 well when we all started this thing it's 2024 or whenever we started I know it was 1994 but it was a long time ago you're going to make a presentation to the  rules or what they call it the what did he call that there today the the committee the competition committee  the people that I'm going to Lobby to change this great League to the way that it should be now Dr Ray  in recent years in fantasy basketball I have been unlucky um I've had you know you know my teams Doc in yeah I'm sure you're basically in the semi-finals in every league in every year that you play and so that's typically the case for me but I haven't been getting shot up but I've just got a lot of bad stories to tell right well not this year doc I was in four Yahoo League's like I said I'm in one one championship game this week I'm going to win three out of those four I won Camden Dynasty final four of 30 deep this is probably the most successful season I've had like by percentage I'm gonna win a chip in four out of my six League's so 66% um that's about a successful as I've ever been and I've been successful so I'm very excited right now Doc um I won a nice little stack of money in a league called what's this league just NBA Dynasty I won 723 to 7:03 how did I win pickups streamers staying one step ahead of the opponent that's how you win and that's how I won that League um doc I'm about to win a it's a 16 Team league and this league doc I got to give you the math on this league okay I mean um and I'll get to Camden down to see here in a minute in the regular season it's a 16 Team league and it's uh not a regular it's a you know it's a custom league on Yahoo um 20 in one was my record in the regular season and I had  let's see here 113,000 points the next highest guy had 93,000 points um and so I lost the second to last regular season game Doc and I lost cat I lost kuzma um I lost another main dude Jalen Johnson so I was like um am I not gonna close the deal here I've got a very very close win last week and it looks like I'm going to close the deal now in terms of Cam Dynasty doc I am super excited about winning this Championship Ken kreitz want it last year the K train obviously our colleague here at RotoWire and and he was in it had a badass team me and Ken and Darren Wilson who's a media guy in Minneapolis um we we have the three best teams in the league one of us were going to win this championship and it ended up being me Doc here's how I won this league because Sunday was a war of attrition it came down to Sunday I had like some little leads going into Sunday but it was all going to come down to basically Sunday night with the Minnesota LA game he had Anthony Davis I have Reeves and I have LeBron  so is the date goes along um he loses three guys due to injury kind of sort of the reason I want okay you got to have some luck guys he lost Draymond Green to the back he lost Anthony Davis to the eye and he also lost who else did he lose and Franz Wagner to the ankle injury okay all on the same day now Doc ion that day um couldn't play James Harden and I didn't and he had a great first half and I was like oh my God what did I do but then he left Midway through the third quarter that's why I didn't play him because he was off the injury report then on then started and I was like no I don't trust this at all um I also had who else left Jalen Johnson left the game um and LeBron James couldn't play and I couldn't play Caruso as well so I had injury hits he had injury hits and Doc really what won the league for me man we're streamers throughout the week um I I streamed Reggie Jackson on a pop night I streamed remember the Saturday game theory and Prince had against Cleveland when he popped for 18 with four threes um I'd Highsmith in the game where he had 12 points for steals a block in two threes I had a larva on Friday night it wasn't that great of a line but he gave me one one and one in the black Steeles and threes Metuchen mechu I want to talk about more here in a minute um Saturday was the streamer doc I mean this was a three-run home run of a streamer okay he had 20 points when nine of nine from the field three steals two threes okay and it came down to the fantasy gold is it always does with me and Darren um and then I stream house on the idea 25 points was seven three is I I streamed Davion Mitchell in that game at the Garden when he had 11 points with some goodies on good shooting that's why I won the league guys that was the margin of Victory me streaming and nailing the streamers so again even if you've got a rock star team like I do you've got to you've got to get the new ones you've got to go into the cracks for these guys man so doc let's pivot to tonight and  and talk about Chimes you met you because it's funny you mentioned him because I picked him up last week and 30 deep and through him on my roster just in case I had the play this week and needed a warm body and and he's it he's in my lineup if we were playing if it counted so met two um you like help me win this league he will always be in my good graces because of that uh in the last game he went 7 Points 11 rebounds two assists in a three that game that I told you about okay I already gave you the stats on that um tonight it's Detroit at Chicago so doc I really like this spot this is um the last challenging slate of the NBA season there are no games on Saturday Friday everybody plays Sunday Everybody Plays um I think everybody plays on Friday I know everybody plays on Sunday so you've got these huge silos on Friday and Sunday and it's not going to be hard filling out your lineup the decisions are going to be between like Aaron Gordon and I don't know you know Jaden McDaniels like like really good decisions okay so tonight met two and I'm recommending people getting him in there I think he'd be a good looking DFS as well maybe even doc on for a little double double prop right I mean not like the double double proper but a point rebound prop because if it's like 1 5. 5 7  I think he's gonna put up numbers tonight yeah I mean I don't know why he would not put up numbers there's there's no reason that he should not finish  this thing off with a flurry of stats across the board not I'm with you he's gonna be super cheap and FanDuel super cheap and DraftKings he's gonna be a value pick no matter where you get him and he should have an unprohibited path to Stats what's up let's check out his his point in rebound combo here on DraftKings Dr a and  here we go again doc  here we go again this is such a pet peeve of mine this is such a guess what doc there is none guess what  there is no line in rebound combo prop for Chimes you met too  not yet there isn't  maybe maybe 3:00 this afternoon there's so many things I want to say right now so many cuss words I want to utter right now and I'm just I'm just let's just keep it moving man um that that ain't cool driving that now that ain't cool man like we're gonna spot the actual guys who could pop for us and you're just gonna take them off the board it drives me crazy absolutely drives me crazy that that's why we don't do the prop game a lot I mean legit like I was at I was at another place you know last year another house for a minute and doing all this prop betting and doing a morning you know thing like we're doing right now and um you know you get you get hot on these guys man this guy's gonna pop so when someone's gonna miss a game I got the little nook and cranny here guy and of course it's never on DraftKings because the wise guys and girls the DraftKings know that too but it's so shady and so sketchy and so greedy of them not to put these lines out on these players it's so greedy it literally pisses me off doc it is a massive pet peeve of mine  He's a starter for a team right now put out a prop on him Elevate the number let us Target it they just take it off the board  screw you DraftKings I mean legit screw you that ain't cool man that ain't cool it's greedy oh I got another guy for you  can I interest you in Sam Houser who like I said he was my booty call he was my fantasy mistress he was my one night stand again and again and again and again and again over the season okay doc um against Milwaukee the other night 8 points two steals two threes okay you're not gonna get a huge game usually from him tonight it could be an empty the bench game for Boston doc Tatum is questionable Brown is questionable holiday is questionable porting us this questionable Derek white is not questionable but it's probably going to be a bench game for the Celtics they're at home against the Knicks who are a great defensive team but this is about minutes this is about shots and I think Sam Houser's going to be a good source of Threes tonight  he should be I mean anytime the Jalen Brown is not playing you want Sam Houser in your lineup we talked about this the last three weeks  so yes I and I I don't know why Boston would not rest everyone from now until till the playoffs because  I mean you worked really hard you can served energy all year you're up 15 games or 14 games whatever the number is it's absolutely ridiculous youngest is done the Bucks are clean on the number two by a thread right now and Boston can just chill make sure Al Horford feels like a 27 year old you know Monster when he gets out there make sure porzingis  has zero tweaks on his body Tatum and brown and Derek white should all be good to go jerus should be good to go like this is just they should just let Sam Hauser shoot every time tonight  so I agree on the house or thing but I disagree overall  I disagree with that you want them to have some flow going into the playoffs I don't that they're good I want them healthy here's here's the here's the comeback to that Boston has been doing the rest thing for about two months  um I I need to dive into this I want to talk about this in more detail on on NBA radio so more of a reality thing that a fantasy thing but doc here's where my mind is out with this  let's just let's take the last 30 games okay of a sample size for Boston doc I bet in that last 30 game  I bet you they have had their primary lineup with all their guys for 10 of those games does that sound advantageous for a team heading into the playoffs what I'm smelling from Boston is they think that their first round series is going to be their sort of Regal okay but what if you get Philly what if you get Miami and Jimmy Butler decides to join the party because Jimmy Butler is in a coma right now he's a nest okay he's not Jimmy Butler but doc what if he just decides to wake up what if he decides to shoot some Red Bull okay and and he like I mean the Jimmy Butler thing is insane it's insane like so so we just say goodbye to you for 82 games and then we say hello to you again is that what we're doing here um but that that's my Bible with Boston dog I'm not saying they're not gonna win the east  I'm not gonna win the East okay so we're sort of nitpicking maybe about a point is mood situation here but I don't like this I don't like you know they got a back-to-back so Horford one night person gets the next they've been doing this for two months doc two months I've been doing it all year and they continue to win  they have but I just I don't like it um it's some point to me you got to get lather up because  you can't take that first run for granted and you've got five days off remember the play-in tournament week Monday through Friday we're going to be watching these pit games the top six teams are on their are off their feet for five days doc five why do you need to rest now you got a five-day break coming up  hey you never be thrilled you know it's interesting because I've been talking Celtics all year and you're like nah I got Denver or whoever you got and you you just have been you have been reluctant to join me on this Boston bandwagon that I'm currently on hold on each of the whole thing  well I'm tired I got Boston for a whole thing I think you got Denver for a whole thing or you did oh I got Denver beat Boston twice this year Murray went off on the best defensive back court twice I'm rocking with Denver bro I got I got something animal year and I love the fact that the resting I'm not worried about the I'm gonna worry about them the flow when they go and this is not the Atlanta Hawks were talking about this is Jalen Brown Jayson Tatum and Al Horford you guys was experienced guys Drew holiday you know Eric white guys you know what they're doing guys who are well coached that team was well run this is not um the same thing is trying to get a team like the Sacramento Kings ready for the preseason like like the Celtics are just they're just better than that I think  I hear you dude I hear you that's Doctor Ray Steve Alexander he's an fwa Hall of Famer I'm the fantasy freak Rick kamla and we are the ogs this is the award-winning fantasy basketball podcast on Roto why are can I interest you in Xavier Tillman tonight Doc and this is only a deeply special and this is only if porzingis and Tatum and brown and Horford and all these guys are ruled out okay can I interest you in some Xavier Tillman tonight in the last game he started against Milwaukee played 18 minutes 6 points two assists two blocks one steal two threes um I was kind of like them when he played minutes in Memphis can I interest you in some Xavier Tillman tonight as a streamer  yeah you can I mean I'd rather put I'd rather roll with Tillman and the guy like Luke cornette um me too where I just tell him athleticism and his his ability to play basketball a little bit more than than Cornett and you know this point I don't know why Boston just doesn't let him do his thing like that house of shoot it let me get the rebound and put it back up all right how's her or Tillman where are you going there if if you have the decision between I'm going Houser that it would all depend on like I gotta have a good look at this matchup I've got in 30p and like determined do I need threes and points or do I need rebounds blocks and kind of go kind of go that route but I think I need threes and points so I'll be going how's our either way  so let's talk about Portland here we're trying to give you some streamers for tonight it's the last difficult slate of the NBA season um because Friday there's a million games Sunday there's a million games let's talk about the Golden State at Portland game tonight doc you've got Jabari Walker and you've got Chris Murray and the probably on your way by right now um and you can go out there and scoop them up Walker in the previous game against New Orleans wasn't great for points 10 rebounds no goodies okay but the last two weeks he's been at 11 points 12 rebounds two assists one three he's very light in the defense but if you need boards he could he could be an over the top guy for you now Chris Murray's more versatile right he's better at the three line in the New Orleans gave me one 14 five in two two blocks one steel four threes maybe the best game one of the best games of the year for Chris Murray who's 3-point shot has been very erratic and frankly very disappointing this year over the last week Dr Chris Murray's going 12.6 rebounds almost a block almost to steal and 2.3 threes per game Jabari Walker or Chris Murray tonight if you have the choice which way you go in here  and through a tough because I really don't trust either one of them  but I think the name I trust more just based on the overall Way the season has gone would be Jabari Walker yeah I I'm gonna go with Walker  did Chris did the did you even play oh yeah there's Murray Murray played  37 minutes last game  and he played well  five fouls yeah that's  that's a coin flip man I need to know I need to know who started well they they probably will start 8 in is playing Grant is out to Marty Kamara is out so these guys are probably going to start tonight like a 90% um and by the way a great follow on Twitter RotoWire NBA okay there's all these constant updates like right up to game time and stuff because right now um look like like we talked about one of the reasons I want Camp dynasty was Chimes he met you how did I get you as you met you well on Saturday doc you follow the news and you find and I took that one all the way up to the starting lineup but now it's right because if met two is coming off the bench I don't want um I don't trust Monty Williams that way but if Monty's gonna start him don't I trust it okay and boom they started him he had a perfect game basically and so you got to take the soul the way up to game time set alarms for yourself setting alarms Doc is literally the key to me winning all these championships it's literally the key okay um staying up on in these 20 teams he's 16 teams I mean I started that Pereira dude from Memphis right I started that  guy from Detroit that we can't say his name the elbow but I'm you know what I'm saying like the long name with these in the East I don't like I mean like I don't I don't even really know their games okay these are points I know they're playing 15 minutes they're getting like 33 and a half points per game all right I need a whole Phil boom go in there dude and then you cut them and you move on to the next streamer and you turn in your burn um let's I I here this out here real quick I started Pereira in a FanDuel lineup there and he did not play so that was that was me not setting alarms and not paying enough attention and right at game time but I'll tell you the most as the K train can Crites has told me on numerous occasions the most popular  NBA page at RotoWire is the lineups page and you can go lineups and all the proposed starting lineups for today tonight our out there if you go to line up space under NBA so looking at Portland it's says cute Henderson ran Rupert Chris Murray Jabari Walker Yonder 8 and those are the projected starters and then they'll have this updated right before game time but it's a great it's a great tool to use and and at least there is some some science behind that they're just not guessing what they think the lineup's gonna be but it's also not an exact science because we don't know but it's it's the page you want to check out  yeah I mean you trust us right over here wrote a while we're the best in the biz so yeah we got you um let's get into doc let's take a little bit of inventory here um because and by the way for me on Jabari Walker versus Chris Murray it depends on what I need if I if I'm more in the business of needing rebounds then I would pick up Jabari Parker and stream him if I need goodies fantasy Gold Blocks threes and steals which you pretty much always do then I would go Chris Murray um just flat open canvas I would rather have Christmas all right I want to revisit doc where we write or were we wrong about the shutdowns around the league and let's start with the Blazers right here I feel like we nailed this doc because we warned people about Jeremy Grant we warned people about eight and eight and his playing surprised me but Anfernee Simons is not Jeremy Grant is not okay I didn't think they were going to finish the season and as you were this isn't like Mr smart guy the whole time there are teams that I missed diagnosed okay  and we'll get to that in a minute but if in my thinking on the Blazers doc was if they're going to take those last two years with Damian Lillard there were of course going to take the first year with out Damian Lillard right as they continue to hit the reset button here so I feel like I feel like we nailed Portland with the exception of DeAndre 88 I feel like we're getting gravy real right now with eight and I'm surprised he's playing right now but what was your view on Portland well I mean I I think the whole story there is DeAndre ayton I think you and I both knew that Jeremy Grant was not going to finish this thing out  we kind of knew that every Simon's and Malcolm Brogden would get hurt like a lot of it was not surprising but when DeAndre ayton missed that snow game  because he couldn't get his car out of his driveway or didn't try yeah I was like man this is this is done like we're not gonna see this dude again all year like I just thought he was didn't care and it's gonna be shut down and it's almost like  someone's like Portland is punishing him making him get out there and play in these games like yes what yes what Mr Max contract welcome to Portland get out there and play with these scrubs you on play with and you're  playing every game down the stretch I don't care if you're ready to go to Cancun or not  take a doc that's the take of the day right there I'm buying what you're selling and Doc the Blazers obviously don't care if DeAndre ayton gets hurt right now that I've seen I don't care about DeAndre ayton's long-term health and well-being right they're playing him right there they're resting all these other guys are throwing eight now out there so you know the sarcasm continues here yes don't care if he gets hurt and blows the tire here at the end of the year they got him out here they don't give a damn no they don't and and by the way the next good year they're going to get from DeAndre eight and will be his contract year okay he is in cruise control mode right now on that max deal um let's talk about he's playing good I mean you got to give it to him  yeah but it's these are silly season numbers right do this in October do this November do it when teams are geared up for you and then he'll go back to being 14 points and nine rebounds he's tearing up that Glee though  yes Julie he really is you're right the Memphis hustle don't know what hit him the okay see blue don't know what hit him the Maine Red Claws docked I don't know what hit him the four Wayne Matt Aunt stock don't know what hit him okay I love that team named the Fort Wayne Mad Ants oh my God damn it up um doc should we just stand up and take about about  the Utah Jazz should we just take a bow  about the Jazz you know that you were that was all you do that was on you I I was I was not a part of that what about the Spurs the you know I thought  when he was shot down  today and then I did it NBA radio show with Antonio Daniels and he said cam  teams don't shut down top picks and I went back and looked at and I was like he's right and so I stopped the Wendy shutdown thing like  a couple weeks into the season a month into the season so we got that right that when we was going to play it out and doc I know you were saying earlier you know he's done for the year he ain't done for the year that was a back-to-back um Wendy was mad at Gregg Popovich according to Gregg Popovich I'm about to have to sit out last night's game so I believe Wendy's gonna play the last two games here Doc and he was not shut down and then you know I don't feel like we were wrong about Devin Bissell Jeremy so Hand they were hurt okay and they took it way late in the season and then shut them down right and now you've got killed in Johnson and I was watching the game the other night he turned ankle or whatever it was um so he's gonna be done for the year they're not gonna bring him back out so San Antonio did not shut down their main dude this year doc  no and and I I had windy in a couple of leaves and I got to the to the playoffs and got you know I got second place in two other League's and every time Wendy sat out again my my team  just kind of stunk I mean that's how good he was he was just carrying every team I had and it's funny um I went back and was watching some  podcasts that we did in the off-season last year with Adam King  and it was an interview with a bunch of fantasy analysts and and then it is like get to know an analyst and then at the end he's like where are you drafting women Yamaha and what do you think he's gonna do and almost everybody was like  you know I'd be comfortable taking him and round four maybe around three and a couple guys like you know if doctor is in your league he's gonna take him  in the first or second round because he reaches for all his guys but man I did reach for women every year or everywhere that I drafted and he exceeded my expectations by Miles and these seven and eight blocks six and seven steals five threes 30 points  20 remount games or just  off the charts man and what is gonna happen when he learns how to play in the NBA and what's going to happen when Gregg Popovich and the Spurs are running plays  for Victor women Yamaha how deadly is he going to be in fantasy League's and will we even be able to allow him to play in regular fantasy leagues or are the numbers just going to be too big I don't know  lots of chew on right there way way back in the day I talked to a guy when I was back in Minnesota um any played fantasy hockey okay early and I I play fantasy hockey now um but and I have and I've only played it for like four years doc I mess around with fantasy hockey it is not you know a blood and guts thing for me I messed around with it kind of stay plugged into the league a little bit this guy told me that they had to take Wayne Gretzky out of their fantasy league because I mean he's scoring 80 goals 120 assists like he's like if you get Gretzky if you get the number one pick you win the leaks we had to take them out of the league um are we going to get there with Wendy I mean maybe I it's hard for me to believe that we would pull a guy out and and say you can't draft him but it's even nutty that we're having this conversation um doc I did reach for wimby in the championship game I'm in right now I have went beyond this team and when we've been a rock star one of the reasons that I'm what was that doc 20,000 points ahead of the next closest team it's laughable man and so yeah I I took wimpy in that League he's been absolutely since Sensational and so let's continue on here with these shutdowns man this Grizzlies doc I can't remember what I said on a about them and I feel like I was wrong about Memphis I kind of thought that the Jackson and Bane would would play this out clearly Memphis out of their ideas I thought Marcus Smart would come back at some point doc um beat they just shut their guys down I mean they did like I think smart could have come back  here the finger that was like 18 months ago he jacked up that finger like what's up there right Jackson and Bain to me were healthy and then they just got the plug pulled on him so I was wrong about Memphis I thought they were going to play it out and try to like maintain the culture and maintain competitiveness and is that climbing their gym is like um either pull the guy's off the floor we want to lose well but they have I mean the fact that Jared Jackson Jr was not shut down sooner than he was is the win I mean that is a that is a fantasy win the fact that Desmond Bane  came back and played for what five games after missing half the season the fact that he tried and even came back out at all  I was impressed by that like that to me signaled that neither one of those dudes wanted to be shut down or wanted to quit on their team so they didn't want quit on the season now they the pulled the plug you know over the last 10 days I can't be mad at that I mean dude the injury report when you look at Memphis right now it's like 20 red crosses and then there's like five dudes you never heard of without a Red Cross next to their name so it's just absolutely disaster the g-league whatever the Memphis blue was that what you said no okay see blue is the Memphis hustle doc the Memphis hustle yeah so yeah oh yeah it's bad it's the Menace hustle it's it's the fighting Jordan Goodwin's right now Doc that's the Memphis Grizzly is right now 18 rebound Jordan Goodwin  my garden this league  start for a team but to me he's a legit backup point guard in this league he's a great rebounding guard he's a really grimy Defender it's got to get the shot better um but let's talk about the Pistons doc we're taking a look back at our advice here on shutdowns and largely Our advice was accurate however I was wrong about the Pistons stock and you know what  screw the Pistons for shutting down Cade Cunningham I managed to win the cam Dynasty okay in spite of this and and they were playing him and then they warned and now they've changed the injury designation on him doc um he went from left knee injury management which speaks to load management rest on to now left knee tendinopathy which tendinopathy has been a very buzzword for injury reports throughout the year here so I think with their telling us is he's not playing again this year a couple of things doc I am so happy with LeBron James and LeBron James look doc it got spicy for me in the cam Dynasty when he was ruled out right I'm looking at I got Anthony Davis lurking against me right and blocks her everything in this game with me and Darren Wilson for the Chip And you know Davis like had the thing with his eye and all that kind of stuff and he had to leave I mean that was very much in my benefit LeBron didn't play because of the flu so Doc and then Kate Cunningham shut down I can't play him I did get your mom hurry back on Saturday night that was nice um I somehow managed to go 2003 in the cam Dynasty this year I didn't lose a game okay pretty proud of that man so I did that in spite of Cade Cunningham and guess what guess what because last year they did not shut down Cape cunning pardon me uh late last year he was hurt the year before they did not shut down Cade Cunningham like Antonio Daniel said they don't shut down top pick rookies okay well they didn't so I  thought that would continue this year they've been playing Jade and I'd be all the way through so is this rest is it a little bit of a knee barking at him should we be concerned about that all I know is this stock I am going to be aggressively shopping Cade Cunningham this off season in the cam Dynasty I'm out I'm good I really like the player okay I really like the player the style ends are fantastic what I'm gonna do doc I'm gonna bundle Cade Cunningham with a high second round pick okay and and maybe one of my younger guys and maybe just a little sweetener on the edge okay and I'm gonna go big game hunting for an SGA for a Devin Booker for Donovan Mitchell I'm gonna try to sort of upgrade um the guard spot with Kate Cunningham because I don't trust this Detroit thing Doc I don't like how Monty Williams is coaching this team at all from the hard ass heavy hand approach right that has not worked to the rotations to the are they going to take again next year doc I'm out dude I'm out I will be trading Cade Cunningham most likely he will unless it's just crickets out there he will be off my roster I'm not just gonna give him away but if I can scoop up a legitimate deal for Kate he gone  well I think you and I have been mad at Detroit all year like nothing they did all year made sense and like you said  you know early on and halfway through the season there are a team that is I'm trying to figure things out and rebuilding  but they want to win right now and they want to act like they're a team that can win right now but they're not that team so you basically have money out there making all this money and making all these decisions on these guys and they're just out there running around like trying to play basketball but  you know  lack of steals lack of blocks from Cade Cunningham  I think he's solid but I think he's overrated I think his name is bigger than his game I think you feel that way and then sort of what you're saying without saying it his name is big enough that I think you can throw some some stuff in there with him and turn it into like a real badass player and I don't know that Kate Cunningham is  the badass player that that you really want to build your fantasy team around  I mean I I  think he is  stress fracture now the knee like  I don't know like is he just gonna have kind of a broken body like these are the decisions we have to make Dynasty League guys like he's either mine for the rest of his career or I make the decision yeah I want out on this Cade Cunningham Adventure I want out doc I don't like this movie I don't this movie sucks this is like one of those movies that my wife will put on we're just a bunch of random ass scenes and there's no ending the scenes don't tie together you're like it's good actors but it's like what is this movie even mean and then the movie just freaking ends they roll credits and you're like I don't even get the ending they didn't even in the movie that now I'm just pissed right they didn't even end the movie Why Did I watch this thing this is unbelievable okay it's the rotor wire on the game's play the game  The Game's played on K2 64 12 602 like there's nothing like about that nothing like  or doc we were right now yeah so that's where I'm at with Kate come out on Monty Williams too I'm out on the Monty Williams thing okay what what you know oh it was such a great coach in Phoenix was he you had Devin Booker you had Chris Paul you had cam Johnson I'm gonna kill Bridges you at DeAndre eight and you had good bench players like I mean yeah I mean he didn't stop he won coach of the year and all that but like we're seeing it now we're seeing it now you got Stewie you got Duran you got Cade you got Ivy you didn't play him right clearly you have no bench um but anyway um we were right about the Wizards die we in terms of the shutdown thing we were right about the Wizards again guys you can see this coming a mile away first year shot caller with a team taking over a team at the bottom head oh that's the most obvious tank of all time okay what a Danny age do his first year in Utah they tanked what a Joe Cronin do his first year in Portland they tanked what did Michael Singer do his first year in Washington they tanked what did Weaver do his first year in Detroit they  tank okay it's it's an automatic top and so we nailed we nailed the Wizards  yeah I I just gotta say hats off to Jordan Poole for trying to be weirder than DeAndre ayton I mean I can't figure out which one of those dudes  deserves the fantasy flake MVP award this year the fantasy flake is that what you said  yes  Corey kispert then he have Deja I love those dudes yeah without the Denny for for having a good year and making me feel kind of smart for having him on my roster all year and we kind of called The Quarry kisper thing coming as well and I'm interested to see what Kula is gonna do in the future  Rashawn Holmes thanks for getting me to the finals in 30 deep and then thanks for nothing else all year and died  accused man somehow  someway just still plugging along and putting up big numbers for those Whiz  I mean you know they say anybody can put a bat numbers on a bad team I mean I don't necessarily agree with that but um somebody's got to put numbers on a bad team I just think Kyle kuzma is a good player it could help when winning team he's just you know he took the money from Washington and it is what it is Doc lastly here let's talk about the honest answer to compo injury before we hit the streets and  take some of the comments from the people Janice goes out obviously as regular season is over with the cap injury we don't know when he's going to come back he might miss playoff games about this it's all unknown right now um a Soleus strain is usually like Giannis as a Soleus strain as a Castro it's usually this particular injury a one to two week injury Damian Lillard said he had this injury he said it was about one to two weeks it's not major but it's something and it might eat into Yana's playoffs a little bit it may create a re-injury situation for you on a story in the playoffs God forbid but doc  we have two games left for the Milwaukee Bucks we have games tonight then Friday and Sunday we get a million games so for the Bucs Bobby Portis could be a League winner over these last two games or if you had him in your lineup last night what he want for 30 points nine rebounds three assists five steals 14 of 18 from the field and two of two from down town the night before when Jonas blue the tire he had 15 and 10 with a steel and a three in two starts this year dot Bobby Portis is going 28 and 8 shooting 66 from the field in two thirds from three so it's two starts but when jaina says out Bobby goes massive and Bobby Portis might be a League winner right now because of this yeah for sure and I mean I would  if he's available in your league you got to go get him but I doubt I doubt that the leaks are still going on  and there shouldn't be any by the ones that are you know hopefully he's already gone but him and Pat Bev man I think Pat Bev is super strong  play right now too and he's starting for them and there's no Jana so everybody else has to chip in Middleton's probably gonna finish up strong I'm guessing  and those bucks man they're just barely hanging on there a game and a half up on the on the Knicks and I guess they held off the magic so  I guess they're going to do it they're going to be the number two seed but with two games left to get some magic a couple days ago it was looking a little dicey but  they're winning without Jana so that's good um papel last night when 13/8 and 6 with a steel in three threes and the Boston game he went 20 and 10 with three assists and four threes he also might be a League winner for you right now go and and Portis isn't going to be available on waivers most likely he is 78% roster in Yahoo leaks but Patrick Beverley is probably 25% roster so he's probably out there uh doc do you remember um do you remember what we were talking about and I mentioned those two trades in the same hankies letter League where I traded away Trey young a traded away sucks and it was two different trades but I got Fred vanvleet I got Bobby Portis I got Mike Conley I got Rudy gobert I got Draymond Green and I got Duncan Robinson remember when we were talking about those trades yes  so your boy won Sam hankies letter because of those trades I had some online up on Sunday 24 points for bombs um I pulled Conley out because I had already won the game it was 5 4 going into the late game so I pulled him out but I got Fred Van Vleet in in those trades as well final day of the Season he had 24 and 12 with two threes and and one steal doc the guy offered me those trades it was like Van Vliet Goldberg Draymond and Duncan Robinson for Trey young and Ricky Council okay yeah where do I say and it was like another cluster of guys for Jalen Suggs and bol bol and I was like yeah um literally powered a championship doc so yeah I mean this is been a great year hope the people out here document went in ships as well we've been doing our best with you guys with the analysis and God will and we'll be back here next year doing it again too hopefully through the playoffs but let's set up some comments right here and talk to the people can I just give my my man Luca dhantx it's a real quick shout out 34 points  9.2 rebounds nine point eight assists  1.4 steals  0.5 blocks  4.1 triples  and a career high 7 8. 6  free throw percentage to go along with this 49% field goal percentage  that dude took overly this year  his team took over fifth place in the west Lucas shot up immediately the number two in the MVP odds and I think it's a two-man race right now between Luca and Nicola yolk from BP no SGA SGS no longer in the in the in the core of that conversation for you he is he is I just can't imagine them giving it to him over  yoga it's your Luca but I guess I don't know  I don't know man I just know that I just know that the season that Luca just dropped in our face is  up there with one of the  craziest Seasons I've ever seen a guy have you talked about  the numbers that kind of pop off the page and scream MVP at you it was Luca every single night throwing a triple doubles and dude they're like 15 and two over their last 17 games he's helping Kyrie Irving get up off the court there acting like brothers out there and chemistry is all good like I I'm so far it I'm gonna throw some money at Dallas to win it all that's it I'm doing it let's let's talk about that real quick because Dallas is a freight train right now they are looking that look there's no there's no ceiling on them right now Doc do you know what I'm saying there's no ceiling on them so let's go to odds to win the championship here um oh my God oh my God Dallas is a plus 2200 to win the championship right now  absolutely it would not surprise me if they were in the NBA Finals I love Dallas to win it all at plus 2200 here's the other bet doc how much Dallas to win the West um I bet the odds are really nice on this as well plus 1100 for Dallas to win the West I believe right now the West finals is going to be Dallas in Denver  although well that can't happen if Denver's in the one hole and in Dallas I got Dallas beating the Clippers in the first round by the way um and so then that would be a second round meeting so there you go right there but but they will play um I would still I'm still gonna probably go Denver over Dallas stock but I do like Dallas um you know you want to get a little fun with your money throw 10 throw 20 throw 50 whatever you can do to try to really get a big bang and have a dark horse win it all I think the Mavericks that those numbers are great bet stock yeah I like to and I love I love when the Clippers and the Mavericks play in the playoffs because they hate each other and it's it's usually pretty pretty fun ah would you like to hear from the people yeah let's do it  Tori Thompson said my final opponent is mad at me because I already have a better team and now I just picked up Trey young Tyler hero and Brandon Ingram should I feel guilty that's that's solid solid question no  no it's you guys I just want 20 in one on a league of 16 players and I finished 20,000 points higher than the next closest guy  you want to die  you want to talk about guilty that's just greedy okay you know how many games that I had absolutely smoked and I'm still picking up the Abu kannamma moms and guys to throw in at the end of my roster to fill holes dude I was trying to run up stats on this league I went Urban Meyer I was State on these schools so okay I'm trying to cook you 70 to 3 around here and I'm not going to apologize and I don't damn care if you as a coach or bought her to don't want to shake my hand after the game I don't care I want the dub next  there's not a lot here I think we're done I think we're I think we're shutting this part down Michael Gonzalez  says my league goes all the way to the final day two week Championship round man that is tough that is that is very hard and the other thing is very hard is working in this industry and having to blurb a 15 game night when 30 teams are playing and that's sort of what we get on that final Sunday and but then again it's the final day of the season so it doesn't really matter what you write  it only matters if that guy's really gonna carry into the playoffs but man those those 15 game nights are Ricky and this 15 game Sunday is going to be nuts if it  for the people that it matters to  I do not envy your position I'm glad that I will not be required to watch any of that so again you got to set alarms for 12:45 for the 1:00 games for 315 for the 3:30 games and be able to toggle and move away and maybe save a couple of Moves Like if you've got seven waiver moves to the week you know save a couple of them for Sunday because there's probably gonna be some Silly Season goodies out there on Sunday some 30s some 25 from guys you're like wow you just had a huge game that's kind of stuff's gonna happen on Sunday so look alive I mean there might be goodies on waivers that when you're championship this Sunday all right I just proved you guys I won the cam Dynasty streaming guys all the way up until the end I stream to do it on Sunday stream to do it on Saturday okay you're gonna be doing it all the way up to the end and if you're not you're probably not going to win your lead  all right man well the plan is for you and I just keep doing this all the way through the playoffs let's go all the way through the finals I'm psyched about it and that'll be fun because we can talk really everything from DFS to  real life and and all that stuff yeah well we'll be getting all that stuff man all of it and then carrying and I are going to be here on Tuesdays throughout the playoffs as well so I'm excited that we get to keep this train rolling and Rick we will see you next Thursday enjoy the Master's and enjoy some Daytime baseball today I know you're fired up about some Daytime baseball I am I am I I've got I've got a opponents to absolutely shred in Yahoo leagues doc so uh yeah I'm looking forward to this man already off to a good start in baseball a lot of times I start slow dock right I gotta get the pitching staff right I pitching Nails already these suckers don't stand a chance doc I got Strider but I said Ellie De La Cruz in that is my guy all right peace out y'all better
