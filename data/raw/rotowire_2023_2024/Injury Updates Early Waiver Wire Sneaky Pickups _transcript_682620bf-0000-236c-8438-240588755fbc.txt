hello and welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast sponsored by Underdog Vivid Seats and rival fantasy it's Thursday November 2nd I think he's Rick I'm doc  and we're getting ready to rock  hey what's going on everybody welcome to the world of wire fantasy basketball podcast I am so happy to be back I have the fluff right now days I know Steve has been battling an illness here a lot of you may be it's cold and flu season but your boys are back the OG's are back and we've got so much to get to Steve last night in the NBA was it was it was awesome it was really phenomenal there's been a lot of for me I got a problem with the lack of competitiveness and a lot of these games and so if you stayed up late in the Eastern Time Zone we were all able to watch the Lakers and Clippers be extremely competitive over time game Klay Thompson hit a game winner last night for the dubs and we'll get to all of it here we'll talk about some guys who are catching our eye maybe both in a good way in a bad way as we move along here um but Steve what a ball game and I know you're a night owl like me so you were up until God knows when up for me watching a little bit behind live off the DVR about 145 mm I got to see the end of the late Lakers and the Clippers but what I loved about that Steve was old goats flipping load management the bird all right LeBron was in his third game in four nights played 42 minutes last night when 3512 and 7 had the flamethrower with the shot Kawhi Leonard second of a back-to-back he was vintage 386 and 5 2 steals five threes that was the good stuff last  night bro yeah and I had Bob Rathbun on with me Tuesday and he was really excited about the attitude the League's taking toward low load management he hates it and he said a lot of these guys hate it and they don't want to be load managed but but teams almost forced them at times so pretty cool that we haven't really heard a lot about ad and LeBron being questionable I've been out there every night  so yeah and and what was even better about it was 80 got that a breakaway dunk towards the end of the game that gave him his 25th point I think in a  one me a little little cash you know it was a it was good I like it man I like it a lot uh so guys um you know Jimmy Butler could take note of this right I am so tired with Jimmy Butler in the whole heat thing taking these games off they freaking took an L last night to the Brooklyn Nets without Spencer Dinwiddie Nick blackston and cam Johnson at home this cannot happen oh so so just to juxtapose that I want Jimmy Butler to start drinking what LeBron and quiet are drinking um you had reservations on Anthony Davis Dr a coming into the season and rightly so most of the Free World did I did not I told you that I was wide open and fancy free on Anthony Davis so okay last night 27 and 10 for blocks 10 of 18 he was Unreal on the season 26 and 13 three assists three blocks 1.4 steals 5343 85 a recruiting right now are you ready to plug in or you like now this is one week and the other shoes gonna fall like where you at with Anthony Davis man  oh I just posted something I was not supposed to oh  you know I am  I'm coming around a little bit but his Uncle Bob told me on Tuesday you really can't judge anything in this league until we hit 20 games so if ad is still out there cranking away and 20 games I'm all in but I just like I said I mean I fully admit that  I feel like those guys are like screw load management we want to go play and it's a different mentality than it has been instead of trying to see who can miss the most games that they may take a page out of Mikhail Bridges and see who can  who can all right yeah Mikhail Bridges and so you can miss the fewest games  there are some teams that are like in totally locked and go for mode playing their guys and there's some teams that aren't I mean Golden State comes to mind locked in right now Lakers and Clippers come to my locked in going for it right now it's very very fun so so let's shift over here to koala Paul George for a minute here doctor and I want to bring James Harden into this conversation  ever seen Paul George and Kawhi Leonard better together in a Clipper uniform then right now at the start of this season Paul George was phenomenal before he falls out last night 35 and 6 had six threes 20 in the fourth quarter made all three free throws to tie the game amazing um quiet as we said was great last night on the season Paul George massive 295 and 4 2 steals per game um 50 50 90 with the shooting splits Kawaii going 236 and 52 steals the shooting has been very very crisp from him I don't think it's a coincidence doctorate because we've got contractors from both of these guys but James Harden now comes in and and so I'll let you go first on this is is he going to throw off Paul George and Kawhi Leonard or is all of the announcers on TV or saying make their jobs even easier and and help them sustain the numbers they're putting up right now how do you think James Harden it being that that whale in that swimming pool out there in LA is going to impact George and quiet at all  well it's gonna have an impact right there's an impact because Russell Westbrook May Come Off the Bench bones Hyland is going to go away and Bones is playing well I mean he's devastating for bones which makes me kind of sad and then Harden is is yeah he's gonna get a lot of assistance because he gonna need the ball in his hands he's gonna need to be able to score  so I think that is going to impact the scoring apology origin Kawaii a little bit and then the fact that they're it's a new it's a new mind and and personality you're throwing in there I just think everybody is fascinated by its kind of like a scientific experiment we don't it could go really really well and could go really really poorly um  but man I I just  I think  the way that Kawhi Leonard has looked in especially last night like he the game before he was a very good but outside of that he's been awesome all season and PG was money last night too  I'm worried about it disrupting what they have going  I am as well I don't like the trade I would not have done this if I were the LA Clippers I thought their Vibe I thought there um role definition I thought they had a lot of things going for themselves right they're stars are healthy now you bringing James Harden and Steve Ballmer obviously is brand name lustful and and he just wants as much Firepower as he can get in there  in terms of Harden's impact on coin George for me if James Harden goes to LA with the same mindset he went to Brooklyn with where he was the number three he was the point guard setting up to rant in Kyrie willingly taking a vaccine then I think it'll work in Kawhi Leonard and Paul George are still going to cook um but you know coming into this season hard was talking about MVP what you play with the MVP dude you dummy and and you know leading the league in scoring and all this kind of stuff so if he has delusions of grandeur then the House of Cards is going to fall and he's going to be to blame if he goes in there with that selfless man I'm gonna get in where I fit in be the point guard of this team or at least I don't know because maybe Ross is the point guard of the team but in that's again why I just think it's too much I think it's like too much star power Russell's probably going to have to come off the bench at some point here Steve to your point um which is very unfortunate he had 24/11 and 8 last night 24/11 and 8 Old School line  on the year going 15 and 7 5139 and 50 bad free throw shooter what Russ is killing it and I think this is horrible news for Russell Westbrook out there in LA I think they're going to start with them all starting together they may have to just say there's too much redundancy we got to bring rust off the bench now for Hardin Steve last year with Philly obviously tremendous statistical year 21610 led the league in assists  how far does he come off with his personal numbers we talking 15 five and five like what where do you see James Harden's numbers kind of coming in here as he settles in with the Clippers  depends on which guy he wants to be I mean if he's gonna come in and feed the ball to  to the to Kauai and  and PG  I mean he may not score more even score more than 15 a game with that case I think it's this will be up there I think he'll challenge tray and Ty for the for the league leading assists but the overall numbers would be down he'll spend a lot more time I think  standing around if he's pumping the ball into those guys he won't be looking very shot I could see 13  13 10 assists and six boards Maybe  it's been it's a lot like it reminds me of the Chris Paul situation and in Phoenix you know Chris Paul's gone from being the man to be in the facilitator and standing back and watching Bells work for the most part  and if if heartened does that it's good news for Kauai it's good news for PG it's good news for Westie so I'm not expecting any miracles from hardened when he gets there but I just hope he can play nice with others and they all they all they all get along  I don't I don't hope  it goes out there and his devices  playoff meltdown right because it's coming um and and you know if they have like a 49 win 50 win regular season and everybody's geeked out there and oh my God James Harden once again I mean it's his way guys but um we had the king's move on last night dock with out it's Rick Hamlin it's the great doctor I Steve Alexander here on the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast but before we get to some players who were catching our eyes so far um you know no dear and fox for Sacramento Debian Mitchell AKA off night with 13 and 4 did have three steals I believe had three threes in the game as well last night of sabonis got to pick up with his numbers 23 11 and 8 they're not anticipating it being a long-term app since with deer and fox but um decent stat line I thought from Davie on Mitchell you know I think he played 30 minutes last night or 28 minutes he got starters minutes so um he wasn't sort of yo-yo off the court but obviously they lost as clay hit the game winner two tenths of a second left  Sac just can't beat that Golden State team Steve Wright first round last year you lose that Heartbreaker on Friday night when Steph swords for 41 you lose again but what you think of Davion Mitchell and are you like hard recommending everybody to pick him up now the fox is on the shelf for a minute now because I would have and I played him in DFS I've got him on a dynasty team he's in that lineup I'm not sure if it's yours of the other 30 team I can't keep my two dynasties I can't tell him apart kind of like the corn and peanut oil thing but um I I did play Devi on in DFS he did put up solid DFS points and  I was looking for a little more hairy Barnes last night but we didn't get it he can Murray looks very good but not recommending Davie Elementary pickup mainly because the Kings only have one more game this week  so it was a two game week and that's not enough time really to make him happy and I feel like the way Fox bounced up from twisting his ankle that badly and getting right back on the court yeah I knew it was gonna swell up I was gonna miss a game or two but I don't think he's gonna miss much more than that so I don't I think by the time you get Mitchell fired up and in your lineup it's gonna be too late LeBron versus Jordan magic vs bird Berkeley versus Michael basketball synonymous

Rick Hamlin it is Steve Alexander we're the ogs on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast let's get to some players who have caught our eye so far Steve let me hit you first of all and and he's your guy becoming my guy um and and I you know it's relatively obvious here but but Chet Holmgren man  um Steve gentlemen like I don't know like I I had a big bang Carol opinion you know coming out of college worried about the frame of chat I'm no longer worried about the frame of jet I'm not um it's the and the NBA is an Ever it's a lead that's getting ever less physical right but this dude is really really skilled and and a way better shooter than I thought he would be this early in his career I mean obviously missed last year's about a weekend on the year go in 16 points seven rebounds two point two assists 2.6 blocks one steal two point two threes only player in the league get two plus blocks and two plus deals 6052.80 with the shooting splits and when they kick out to him that right wing and he's got a tied up and lets it go it's if he misses him like whoa um it looks great coming off his hand I love the way he competed against Yoke's on Sunday afternoon and a game were okay see got beat  the frick down he held his water against Nicola yokich and I'm still a big Paula van Carol guy we'll get to him in a minute here Steve but I like if we redid that draft  I don't know man I'm obsessed with the combination of Rim protection in it in threes I'm obsessed with it the Myles Turner's guys like that Brook Lopez is Evan Mobley should be this guy right and and Jet checks both of those boxes Paula ban Karen doesn't check either of those boxes so um I know you love you some chat but but he's been way better than I thought he was going to be this early  well I mean I I'm not gonna take a Victory lap just yet but I mean this is sort of what I was hoping for this sort of what I was I thought this was what we were gonna see and if you think about it we're only a weekend  where we gonna be if he stays healthy where we going to be in three months when he really has some time under his belt and and figures it all out and you know I I think this whole Rookie of the Year argument is interesting like is check on we're really a rookie I mean he hasn't played in an NBA game until now but he sat on an NBA bench for a year at NBA Trainers for the year he had he was in every meeting and every every video session he was hanging out with NBA players so I mean he's not I don't know that he should really be in the Rookie of the race he's got an advantage over a guy like Victor but you know Victor is protecting the rim Victor is banging threes and so is checked and Chet looks better I mean Chet Chet looks like a seasoned and NBA yes special right now  it's a great point like I  got guys I expected shot blocking I think we all did right I thought maybe 13/7 and 2.2 exceeding all of those in the three-point shot so Steve get us into it will kind of play tennis here take me and everybody watching the road to our fantasy basketball podcast into somebody's caught your eye so far oh  well um  Jalen Johnson and DeAndre Hunter of the Atlanta Hawks both look different this year a Jalen Johnson spent time in the G League  and really gained confidence and gained A New Perspective on how to play basketball he came off the bench last night he's bounced between starting coming off the bench they've got City Bay their kind of jamming everything up if Sadiq Bay wasn't around  it would be Jaylin and DeAndre every night  and so that needs to work itself out and I think it will city has looked good coming off the bench Jalen's look good coming off the bench I'm not sure it really matters who starting so much but the Andre Hunter I picked him up in a couple weeks last night and  he looks finally looks like the guy that the Hawks thought they were drafting a few years ago out of Virginia and you know as as Raphael and I talked about on Tuesday  he's been scared to shoot the ball he under Hunters like he is he came from an offense where they that really wasn't the way they ran it now he's being told to shoot the ball whenever whenever he wants or whenever he can and he's not really used to that he has been used to that but he's doing it and then the numbers just they look better like he looks like a much better player only a week in the season but the Hawks had that big comeback win when they were down 2 1 and I think that kind of changed the mindset of that team got him turned around  yeah I mean hunter Scotty get healthy and stay healthy obviously he is right now that's been a huge issue it seems like every time he's gotten some momentum it's a it's an ankle it's a knee it's it's whatever um I took a flyer on Jalen Johnson in the cam Dynasty in the preseason just you know off of waivers like we've got you know you can kind of expand your Oscar and you know you know trick your astral a little bit to carry some extra dudes just see how it goes loved him in the preseason up to last night he was at least one block in one steal and every game this year and I believe he had a three in all of those games as well with a good rebounding rate came up the bench last night and so I don't know what if we're doing a matchup yo-yo thing here with saddiq Bey and Jaylen Johnson bottom line is I I'm very excited that I picked him up um he looks like he's going to be a Mainstay for my team unless Quincy or has other ideas and we shall see the both of those guys have caught my eye as well  so far here doctor right let me talk to you about a couple of Toronto Raptors  and Scotty Barnes a doctorate is delivering first round value right now off the charts and and look I think that this is Scotty Barnes I really do oh he's still leading the league in blocks does he is he still like 275 a game or something he's a 2.4 after last night he's at one steal per game 21 10 and 5 21 10 and 5 you know what Julius Randle type of line here for Scotty Barnett Kevin Garnett type of line for Scotty Barnes when you include the defense on the shootings been great 52 from the field 43 from 379 from the free throw line and and again I don't see these numbers go in anywhere I think Fred Van Vleet going down to Houston really open things up specifically for this guy right here to pack the ball more to get more used to Drake get more shots and then obviously the guy that backfield Fred Van Vleet in the lineup is Dennis Schroder had a marvelous game last night as they cooked the books up in Toronto very weird reality NBA result but I think  had 24 and 11 or something like that but on the season going 16 three and nine assists 45 from the field 50 on 383 from the free throw line and again I think that these numbers are sustainable for Barnes and Schroeder do you agree and have these guys caught your eyes well yeah I drafted Dennis Schroder in almost every League I was like you can get a starting point guard with no competition for his job at the end of your draft that's sort of a proven guy you do it so sure not surprising I don't think there's anybody there to challenge for the job that one guy was worried about doing that is Scotty Barnes and the way Scotty Barnes looks at forward they're not gonna put him at point guard like he's he's doing everything he needs to do right where he is they they shouldn't be changing much there so Scotty Barnes is like 13th on basketball monster in the right of wire ranking system as well that he's borderline first line first round Bowie he was first round by you um for a while there and he he still is in my book so I'm excited to see this this version of Scotty Barnes played the whole season what do you make it through last year like not very many games write 12 13  was that was that him oh Scotty bars yeah no he got somebody else ah I'm not sure you're thinking about yeah he played I don't know 67 72 games something like that Scotty Barnes a baller man he's an availability guy too well I was thinking of somebody else and it's all good it's all good I just woke up man  we got a bob Knight hangover going on  but yeah Scotty Barnes looks awesome  all right take us into somebody else's caught your eye here doctor a early in the season we're about a weekend  uh you know who you know who's number three in the rankings right now Rick do you know who's number three off the top of your head  is it shake you'll just Alexander it is not it is a guy that avoided  taking a hit in a James Harden deal it is Tyrese  Tyrese Maxey escaped with  nobody coming in to steal his job except a bunch of old dudes and KJ Martin  so that trade that sent all those Clippers leftovers who wasn't Nic Batum Marcus Morris and Robert Covington and KJ Martin all went to  the Sixers meanwhile Tyrese Maxey is running circles around people in Philadelphia him and beat him this pick and roll thing going they got this chemistry chemistry thing working and if you drafted Tyrese Maxey this year you are getting paid oh Tyrese Maxey is now Steve my pick to win most improved player and coming into the year my prediction was Jalen Brunson and knowing that we're probably not going to get a huge spike in scoring but we're probably going to get a first All-Star appearance well Maxi is going to check a box of going from you know 20 points a game to 25 26 27 wherever he's going to end up and first time All-Star so if you're out there and looking to play a Futures bet on most improve and how the James Harden trade kind of impacts that with the Maxi thing um I have now flipped on who I believe is going to be the most improved player over to Tyrese Maxey because there's no Harden and so the wrong way is wide open for this young fella um so Dr Ray let me let me give you another guy here that in this is a really really off the radar player maybe on waivers for some of the people to go out and snack right now um because he plays for the Portland Trail Blazers who are a lost and forgotten team now that they've traded Damien Lillard um and it's Malcolm Brogden and on the year he had a really solid game I think 146 and six last night in a win at Detroit they won two in a row now um Brockton is at 18 points 4.6 rebounds 4.4 assists 44 39 71 with the shooting splits playing 27 minutes are we sure he's not gonna win Sixth Man of the Year again I mean I know Portland's not going to win the probably going to shut him down with a month to go in the regular season and I'm prepared for that but but dang dude like and now you've got Anthony Simon Church scoot Henderson blew a tire last night with an ankle injury Malcolm Brogden is completely green lit right now Dr a is it in threes did not giving you any defense but he hasn't for years but but he's caught my eye man brockton's been really solid and shaydon Sharps right there with him right shade on starting which is why Malcolm Brogden is in the conversation for six man of the year and yeah I mean I feel like he's 16 5 and 5 every night he's gonna do that until they pull the plug on him and you're right man Portland is a mess we thought Detroit was going to be bad we thought so he's going to be bad Portland looks really messy excuse Henderson got hurt Anthony Simons down for basically two months right so it's gonna be all shade on Sharp and all my alphabet and  for it for the forcible future there so I like that take I I imagine the odds on Malcolm Brogden winning six Vander are pretty sweet  pretty sweet payout there so yeah I like that take  oh yeah I mean I I wouldn't put money on it because they're not gonna win and I don't see him finishing the year I'm just saying like these are six Man of the Year numbers they're better numbers than he put up last year when he won the award in the on the Green Team docket take us into one of the other players that's not your eyes so far here the NBA season is here on behalf of our friends at Vivid Seats let's get one thing

old job  Marcus smarten Memphis and things are not going well in Memphis  Brogden is in Portland things are not going well Portland meanwhile Derek white who were you was was it you and I had a podcast where I said let's pour one out for Derek white because yeah Derek White's fantasy value is now dead what's your holiday going there yeah we talked about that Drew holiday is there that's gonna push Derek white to the bench he's gonna be forgotten man and and then what happened there white is balling out the Celtics are rolling and trucking people they destroyed the Pacers last night like badly and Derek white he's more confident than he's ever been in his life dude he's having fun and he's out there playing with his guys he's making everybody better he's a just a great piece of glue and roll player for that team and he's also putting up numbers he is man that's Dre I'm Rick Campbell we're the ogs here on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast let's set up some of our comments here um Ian Solis says vooch or Jamal Murray in Nyan Cat vouch had a 2020 last night he really ripped those boards I know that Murray had a 14 assists game recently and you know I am and obviously last night I was just weird I'm not sure what the hell happened in Denver maybe they have something against my old stomping grounds my hometown of Minnesota in Minneapolis I mean that was just static and Denver's look like Flawless literally Flawless basketball so far I'm I'm going Jamal Murray here man um I'm I'm a food sky but I'm not really a gooch guy he gives you about one three doesn't impact you in shop block I know he's an elite rebound or in a double-double every night um but and I I still do see a little bit of a spike overall coming here from Jamal Murray he's gonna need it if you wants to make the All-Star team for the first time so I still say Jamal Murray over boots in Nyan Cat how about you I agree I think I think people forget how good Jamal Murray is because he was hurt for two years he's not hurting now I like him a lot I like him a lot um I I am feeling those guys are not ranked too far apart you look at where they rank and they're not voices a little higher but  I think by the end when it's all said and done it'll be Murray so you go first on this one uh Brian B says hey Doc and Rick is it time to drop scoot I have him in both of my leagues 10 team nine cat head-to-head and 14 team 9 cat head-to-head so are you hanging in there with scoot honestly I saw that he turned his ankle last night and left I don't know details on um it may be you do Steve is he out one to two weeks I doubt they've made any kind of diagnosis on that yet but but but are you dropping scoot right now well I think the key is you gotta 10 Team league you gotta 14 Team league in a 14 Team league based on what's going to be on the waiver wire I'm probably sticking with scoot unless I got like the Henry Hunter or or Jalen Johnson or one of those guys that's just sitting out there in attending League  I think we've seen enough to to wear I know there's good players City on your wayward and you're like I've got school  but I don't want to cut a name like scoop because everybody knows his name because he spent the summer playing against Victor woman  but there's there's guys putting up big numbers in 10 Team league wave of wires so I think on that League I'm probably dropping scoop picking up whoever I can get the other league probably gonna hang on to him but it is all depends on who's out there but  huge difference between 10 team and a 14 Team league yeah I mean there's no way I'm dropping scoot in a 14 Team league there's no way um put them on IR put them on the eel plus if you're in a Yahoo lead or something like that um we run the cam Dynasty on fan tracks and if there's the red flag or sort of the Red Cross looking thing then then both of those you can move them to an IR spot we have six IR spots this year you know for all the Miss games and stuff like that so just shove them you don't have to drop him in a 10 Team league I mean it depends on who is out there and and I probably still am not dropping because he's a point guard and he's going to give you the steals the three is the assist there so rare and you just don't find those on waivers you can go out and find rebounds on waivers or three zombies but you can't really find that point guard stuff so I tend to hang in there now let's go to Sean Kirkland here doc he says should I drop Tillman in eight in an 18  Head to Head category League Tillman was awful last night Memphis I believe Steve is Owen five right now I mean it's completely completely Dreadful um it in an 18 League I'm probably dropping Tillman right now there's got to be somebody better out there maybe is that Collins is out there and in 1800 at the five spot in San Antonio I did two uh eight seems Xavier Tillman's gone 10 Team league Xavier Tillman's gone 12 Team league I'm gonna weigh my options see what's out there uh 18 Lee you can't wait on Xavier Tillman to get it going and he was sort of a  sort of a free gift let's see what happens anyway when when Steven Adams got hurt obviously Tillman is not blowing up that Memphis  I mean I know  Bob said wait 20 games before making a decision on what you see but Memphis looks bad it's Desmond Bane and then it's just  it's bad so I would I would drop it um the other night let me see if I have these stats here Jaren Jackson junior scored 30 smart scored 23 Bain scored 30 and they lost by 15 to a Dallas Team without Kyrie Irving and scoring has been a major issue for Memphis but they got 83 points from their top three players and still got cranked by 15 to a team without its second best player that's how bad it is in Memphis right now let's go back to the streets here Steve we've got Kim Andrew or Andrew Kim if it's a juxtaposition of first and last name should I drop so Hand nine cat 16 team I say no and I'm looking at Sohan I've got him in an eight-man keeper League that I just joined this year I'm about to drop him I have a dropped him yet I believe that's a 12 team League that I'm in but you know he's the starting point guard he's going to have multi-positional  you know eligibility for your years of PG and a PF in in Yahoo League's so I hang in there Steve but but Trey Jones is nipping at his heels so I understand the question here where you out with Sohan well he what do you say a 16 Team league I mean you you can't drop you can't drop so Hannah 16 Team league but the the interesting thing about Trey Jones and Sohan is there basically Buzz killing each other um and in a perfect pop buzzkill yeah I mean it's a perfect because fantasy managers like oh man so Hand  point forward he's gonna run the show he's starting and Trey Jones is not going to do anything and then Trey Jones is doing plenty so hands so and still looks good on the court like I like him I like watching the Spurs play but fantasy wife he's he's a little tricky right now but I mean  even in a 12 team League I think it would be hard to drop so hand right now so 16 teams I think you have you'd have to just hang on  oh Steve let me ask you a question here from Dante's Inferno and these are two year guys he says what do you think Lively for Bruce Brown nine cat head-to-head these are your guys you go first on this man are you trading up Bruce Brown to get into some Derek Lively I'm probably am a Bruce Brown was bad last night Derek Lively was good last night  Derek Lively had disappeared the previous two games one game he was in horrific foul trouble early yeah and 5,000 like  he only played a few minutes and then the game before that was the game against Brooklyn where they didn't have a center and they went totally small ball  that was the day Ron Sharpe dud I believe and so Lively didn't play in that one because the Mavericks ran small to keep up with him as we saw last night Lively  when when the Hawks are when the Mavericks need a true Center he's it and we also saw Maxi Cleaver go down last night with the foot injury didn't look good it was sort of non-contact he just sort of came down on him funny on his own that's another big man out of the picture that leaves Derek Lively Dwight Powell as the only options in Dallas and Lively looks pretty Lively last night pretty pretty fun and he's only gonna get better week after week so I think that the two game break that Lively took so simply means he's sitting out there available in Morley's and should be I still like Bruce brown but I mean I feel like there are lots of Bruce Browns out there on their art many guys like Lively out there um I would definitely rather have Derek gladly than Bruce Brown Bruce Brown to me is a reality guy he is not a fantasy guy he's not a three-point shooter I think he had six in his debut with Indiana that's not who he is he's not going to have he might not have six threes in a game ever again um and Lively is going to be inconsistent and up and down he's a rookie okay he's gonna be prone to foul trouble he's going to be prone to the Yankees job by Jason Kidd on those nights where he's playing like a rook um but I would rather go Long Haul with Lively then up Bruce Brown James Chan asks doctor a trade Westbrook for Jeremy Grant 14 team Roto um really we play rotisserie basketball people do that like why why would you do that I don't understand like why would you do that I absolutely hate Rodeo's um I will take out a baseball invite I would not take  out of basketball invite to a roto League you got to play head to head man it is by far the best way to go all of that said oh man this one's tough um if you told me that Jeremy Grant would finish the year in a Blazer uniform instead of getting shut down ping pong ball style it's a no-brainer I would rather have Jeremy Grant for the Long Haul then Russ because I'm worried about the impact the heart and mostly on Russell Westbrook more than Kauai and Paul George but doc a I'm gonna say hang in there with Ross because I really do see five weeks four weeks to go Jeremy Grant's going to be in street clothes and he's gonna be in your Ill Spot and Russ one of those guys probably gonna blow a tire and then Ross is going to be killing it trying to get the Clippers out of the play in tournament putting up big cat Big Time numbers at winning time in the fantasy basketball playoffs I guess not that it matters for him he's in one of these Roto League's but I'm hanging in there with Russ because I think Jeremy going to get shot down how about you well Jeremy could also get traded I just feel like everything is so murky and clouded around Jeremy Grant like I I didn't think about drafting him anywhere this year just it's weird like he doesn't fit the mold of what the rebuild in Portland I think he resigned with Portland thinking that Dane was gonna be there and then two days later James like I'm out Peace So then Jeremy Grant standing there like holding holding the football like where did everybody go so I just don't have a good vibe about Jeremy Grant I guess that's about all I can say about it I'd rather have have Russell Westbrook and Ricky can hate on Roto in hoops all you want but a lot of people play it I'm with you I think Roto is for baseball I think head-to-head is for basketball but a lot of people are playing Roblox in hoops just because that's that's how they're commissioner set it up  they may not even know it they may not even know any difference  um I mean I'll leave it at that it's just there's a better way to play um and and you get more spark out of head-to-head than you do Roto it's such a long haul the marathon you get stuck in in statistical quagmires that you can't get out of

going to say goodbye to the people here man all the great people we appreciate you guys jumping into the chat asking us questions you know do it for all these podcasts we are on every Thursday at 11 a.m. eastern time on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast but we lost the great bob Knight last night God bless him on his journey to have and God bless those who left behind his close friends and obviously family members 83 years old and and Bobby Knight is not his way to heaven here dockcase so what you said he had a Bobby Knight story hit us I do and I don't know how I don't know how feel good it is given the situation but it works it's about nice story when I was in sixth and seventh grade my parents drop me off in Bloomington Indiana a couple couple hours south of Indianapolis for a week at bob Knight Camp so I went twice and this is probably like 7980 maybe 80 81 somewhere in there a long time ago and  I remember we checked into our dorm room and then they came and got us and they're like all campers gather at Assembly Hall and they had the author him set up with all these seats on the floor we're all out there there's a stage and Bob and I comes out on the stage and I'm like eight rows back  sitting there with my roommate and  he starts talking and he's like you will refer to me as coach and we do not put up with any crap here and we're gonna have a good time but it's going to be very serious time and he's like setting the stage for for I do not want to see all your little six and seventh graders running around like animals because I will I will shut it down  and so then he brings out Landon Turner all right and Landon Turner played in Indiana University he was supposed to be a first round draft pick in the NBA he got in a car accident uh over the summer and was paralyzed from the neck down  so he was in a wheel or maybe it was waist down maybe waist down at it so he's paralyzed he's in a wheelchair they wheeled him out there and these three kids  right near me I think they were right in front of me are like snickering  and being inappropriate and Knight sees it  and he's like  Joby he's on the Joby write his assistant coach he's like go get those go get those guys go get him bring him up here right now get me a telephone  so they bring out a telephone you know connected to a wire because it's the 80s bring out a phone bring these three kids up on stage he's like what's your phone number  kid gives him his phone number Bobby calls his parents hey it's bob Knight come back here and get your kid  called all three other parents had them come back and get their kids in front of all of us and we're all just sitting there like  like no one said a word everybody was 100%  so well behaved for the entire week it was it was just it was something else that really stuck with me and I would love to talk to one of those three kids today to see see how that impacted their life what's a phenomenal story uh yeah I mean  I mean that's that's  I mean it's it's shocking that even kids right kids make mistakes could make kids make dumb decisions would be snickering at somebody coming in on a wheelchair because they're at that's that's pathetic man and Bobby I had to check him and he did um Dre before we get out of here man anything else you want to tell the people were watching you were to read you hear on the great role to wire platform anything you want to tell the people you know RotoWire is is  RotoWire and ESPN sports Toby I've got my time to find it up equally between all three of those spots I'm easy to find it all three spots the podcast thing we're doing almost every day is super fun this one's great my Tuesday show I'm rotating guests in every every week I think Matt Strauss The Great Matt Sprout my ex co-worker is next Bobby was last Tuesday if you missed that check it out you learn a lot about the Hawks so yeah the only the only guy we didn't talk about Rick that I was hoping we would was Chris Middleton but we can hit him next week minutes limit horrible production the walking really doesn't look that great I was if you got Middleton and 12 Team league you hold them right now  um I I wouldn't have him in a 12 team League uh you know I mean just coming off of the the injury summer and all of the question marks is you going to be ready for opening night it would have just been a no for me um I would hold him though I mean it's gonna be a long haul it's gonna be a month before they get him up to a minute where he's going to be able to hover around 25 and 5 but um he's still I mean he's healthy he's just on a minute's restrictions so I would hang in there but it's gonna be a long slog  all right well you gotta you gotta go to talk to Steve Alford right I am interviewing Steve Alford obviously played for Bobby Knight for NBA radio and I'll be on NBA Radio later today at 2 p.m. eastern time talking about our beloved MBA and and having a blast so for Steve Alexander for
