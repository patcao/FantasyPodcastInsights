know you have you got some options down in Florida and Wisconsin you know sports betting is not legal here so that's where a site like Underdog comes in to play  I made the mistake of throwing in like three entries this past Friday night and then going on a dinner date with my wife and her on the way there saying wouldn't it be fun if we just put our phones away and either of us had I was like I can't really say no to that but what you don't know is that I have 300 dog entries that I've just not gonna check these for the next three hours like what are we gonna do turned out I adhered to that you know made a couple trips to the bathroom and make sure I brought the phone just to do a quick little check in we want two out of the three all right so we're loving playing on Underdog and you know especially like during the week I like during the weekend I'm a little bit more relaxed on it but Tuesday nights Wednesday nights like what else do I have going on I'm gonna toss in some other dog entries and I will say last night I was on the the more on 24 and a half points for Zion Williamson did not see the Pelicans beat up 25 points the entire night on the Nets and Zion barely played yeah leaving score for the Pelicans Court 16 points so that was sort of an oddity usually don't see a winning team with a leading scorer of 16 but you made a smart move you gotta keep the spouse happy and if she suggests that I think anytime anybody suggests that in a non-work situation he ought to take them up on it or all on our phones so much and if we're honest you know once you once you set those pics on Underdog I mean I don't know why it works this way but you're much more likely to hit if you're not stat watching you know like what whenever I stare at the screen is when guys just completely forget how to shoot the basketball but I was on the last night so that felt that felt pretty good even though you had a triple double yeah you are right we both to investigate the science behind that at some point I don't get I I was on I think it was point three bounce assist on Jared Jackson a couple of days ago and I turned into the game on while I was on the radio he literally went the entire third quarter without recording a single stack Point rebound or assist you play the whole quarter and didn't do it I'm like I just have a hard time believing that would have been the case if I was not watching the game but anyway we will talk about some of our potential Underdog liens for tonight maybe later in the show we got 12 games on the NBA slate on Wednesday so we're finally back to kind of a normal NBA schedule things were really weird during the first month with the play in tournament but you know we got our big Mondays big Wednesdays big Fridays and then Tuesdays and Thursdays tend to be those lighter slates if you're watching a Long Live get those questions in the chat we will hit those over the second half of the Pod we'll be going for about 45 minutes so if you start stacking those questions up we'll go rapid fire through those as we move along Brandon we have not really had an opportunity to discuss the OG Anna Novi manual quickly RJ Barrett deal that went down over the weekend no episode on Monday with the holiday I know Steve and Kent talked about it yesterday but really fascinating trade in a lot of ways like normally when a trade like that comes down immediately you're talking about right who won who lost and I don't really have too strong of feelings about it we can talk about some of the fantasy ramifications to me it doesn't this trade doesn't really change the calculus for either team you know it I wonder what Toronto is going to do next perhaps for the next it's like yeah you get a nice asset in OG and nobody I don't think this vaults you into you know Milwaukee Philly Boston territory right now in terms of immediate title contention but it was the rare deal where I think most reactions I saw were okay both teams kind of won or it's a net neutral for both okay you usually you get you know an overreaction one way or the other or one team is accused of fleeing the other I feel like that did happen I thought Toronto made out like bandits in this deal getting a six-man of the Year candidate in a manual quickly who's two years younger than ogn and Obey so you have a little more youth to deal with their RJ Barrett in Canada feels like a perfect fit and he's already gotten off to a pretty good start and keep in mind that that pick usually we scoff at second round picks but the second round pick came from Detroit which means it's basically gonna be like a fringe first round pick so even that it's pretty good you get three good solid pieces and I love the quickly portion of this deal more than anything else that puts it over the top or guy that's on an expiring contract and I think he's going to extend with the Nyx but you're not just trading for OG in an Obi you're trading for a guy that have to know give an extension to and is he really like you just said is he really changing the game that much  are they that much better because they added ogn and Obi I I think hey if it works and OG it plays the best version of basketball from himself and it clicks with the Nicks and all of that then great but they definitely paid a premium to bring him in for a guy that's been on the trade block for a year right and I've always been of the belief that an adobe is a little overrated and it's like you can't say that too loud because there's always going to be people they're like hey no he's not you don't understand this value it's like all right we're going on like year four of this now like all right is he gonna take that next step forward you know and it just kind of feels like he's been mostly the same guy you know he's become a more consistent shooter I suppose since early in his career but really it like he made his biggest sleep you know between like year one year two year two year three and since then you always been a very very good role player but I don't think he profiles to me is anything more than that you know it's like can he ever really be a go-to scoring option maybe the Knicks don't really need him to do that but I don't think their roster is loaded enough on top that swapping out Barrett and quickly for Anna nobe really changes anything I don't think they win more or fewer games you know I think it's just kind of a net neutral you know the fantasy side of things I don't think a whole lot changes for Anna Novi either obviously we have a very small sample at this point he's played one game look pretty good 17 points six rebounds two steals seven of 12 from the field three of six from three again I think he's the type of player that could slide in just about anywhere not somebody that you're ever probably going to ask me okay go be our number one option number two option certainly that won't be the case in New York the Toronto side of this to me is a lot more fascinating because you know they're bringing in two key players here you already have you know a bunch of guys who've been fantasy relevant on this roster so not only are we talking about okay how does a manual quickly how does rj Barrett fit in but you know what does it mean in terms of  down the line for for someone like Dennis schroders all the sudden coming off the back yeah and I and that's where maybe it works out for the Knicks and they needed somebody else that they could rely on they lacked that that other punch they needed to do something to put this team over the top felt like a move of desperation more than anything else but it's so it could possibly work out talk about a guy that's a any Elite perimeter Defender that can knock down threes at a pretty efficient clip each up 50% from 3-point range and his first game with the Knicks and by the way speaking of Underdog plays over 14 and a half points tonight I like it the Bulls are on the second night of a back-to-back some tired legs there and I think they want to continue to feed OG in and Obey to get him comfortable with that Nick's offense so I I like that what about this conspiracy theory that's out there have you seen this with with the ogn and OB trade that there's a dating back like the court case between these two teams is this what we're looking to so this is  relating to the the powerful agency known as CAA which I guess is an agency that represents players Leon Rose was the president of that agency now the president of basketball operations for the Knicks and since being hired he is brought in Tom Thibodeau who's a CAA Guy brought in Brunson who's a CAA guy and guess who is represented also in CAA is it okay that is correct so they are basically just stockpiling the Knicks full of guys that are ripped by this agency so now it doesn't take a once you figure that out doesn't take a rocket scientist to start put the start putting the pieces together start connecting the dots and when I saw that that that's what made me soften on a little bit I thought they just trade all of this for OG and Obi who could leave at the end of the year but this guy is repped essentially by  the guy who runs the Nicks you know no longer officially Affiliated but he's not going anywhere and and so there's a there's a connection there I think that's how old this came together I would be very surprised if they don't have a you know maybe not a Joe Smith handshake agreement but a pretty good indication that that he's going to resign I don't think you make this deal just chance to get you know I don't think you're renting ogn and nobody and giving up those kind of pieces if you don't think he's coming back but I want to go back to the Toronto side of things fantasy wise because again to me I don't think there's a major change in OG's value you know I think if you're if you're holding them in a league you're not you're not panicking because all the sudden he's on the Nicks I think it is maybe it kind of goes up or down like 5% one way or the other I don't think there is going to be a market change their I think the player that most people myself included are excited to see now is a manual quickly because you know on a per minute basis everybody's always loved them he's been fantastic for the most part he was playing 22 to 26 minutes off the bench for the New York dicks we saw him start immediately on New Year's Day against Cleveland play 28 minutes in a narrow Victory did a four fouls so you know maybe could have played a few more minutes have that not been the case 14.6 boards three assists two steals two three  it what is the ultimate upside here because I think it's fun to say oh man he can take off you know he could be an All-Star caliber player in Toronto I've seen a lot of that is that realistic is that something that could happen you know over the second half of this season are we looking more long-term with a manual quickly but what I will say is if you're holding him in a league I would feel much better about his upside rest of season now that I did a week ago yeah and we're already seeing that Toronto is willing to make deals to better their future and I would think just based on the player they gave up so that Emmanuel quickly is the most important part of that trade they they kind of have it in their mind that they're going to start building around that sort of player and they have other pieces but what this tells me is that they're not done I wouldn't be surprised if Pascal siakam was on the move I would be surprised if they moved off of Scotty Barnes but maybe that is the new core is like a Scotty Barnes manual quickly with quickly being your primary scorer I love it I think he's got all sorts of potential I'll go back to this the guy is still only 24 years old I think he's just scratching the surface a sixth man type that I think profiles to be more like an elite sort of score starting score in the NBA a guy that can make a Tyrese Maxey level jump in terms of what he can bring to the  table for a team Toronto is a great fit for him and it's seems like they're going to give him a big a big Lane in which to grow he brought up the Tyrese vaccine comp and I think if you're a Raptors fan that's exactly what you're hoping happens and if you're an expand that's exactly what you're hoping does not happen in fact that those two guys were teammates in college you know they were kind of in my opinion like a slightly less cool version of Monk and fox but make Kentucky said so many of those cool bearings over the years it's like I I don't know I I could totally see that happening I think we can't just take it for granted you know that was one thing I pushed back on a little bit on Twitter was like oh man you could be an All-Star this year but what do you mean with All Star games like a month I got no that's not gonna happen next what we talked about I don't I'm gonna go on record and say I don't think a Tyrese Maxey level Ascent is realistic I mean that that's one of the bigger year to year jumps that we've seen in a while I'm not saying a Man Too Quickly doesn't have that ability I'm just saying I wouldn't expect that to happen it doesn't happen very often but he's in the right spot for it and like you said siaka was played so well over the last couple of weeks that on the one hand if you're Toronto maybe you reconsider whether or not you need to deal him on the other hand is values probably at its highest point  this season and you know that's another guy who you're dealing with a contractual issue down the road and I think  the Raptors have always been pretty realistic I think about where they stand in the NBA and they're 13 and 20 exactly where you're not going anywhere right they have to shake things up I know if you're just buried in the fantasy stuff you know you're seeing man yes I'm playing really well Scott's having a crazy Year we love this trade you kind of don't realize that this team has been out of the playoff mix for a while yeah I mean they're they're they're they're like five games up on the Hornets right now this is not a good situation and and it's not like you're dealing with with a crazy injury situation this is just kind of what you are and they've been this version of of this team for the last couple of years and they're just slowly decaying down the ranks in the Eastern Conference and the guy that makes the most sense in terms of what you could get for him and and how much you would change the the makeup of your roster is moving off of a guy excuse me like Pascal siakam and it just it makes too much sense there and this is a team that everyone's in a while I start to think you know are they comfortable being stuck in the middle and I have to remind myself it's the same organization that made the trade for quite Leonard that was a super aggressive move moving off of a fan favorite they're top scorer in  DeMar DeRozan they were willing to do that and then they've just kind of like parked it for the last couple of years I think they want to get back to that level of aggressive nests and then you know we'll see how it turns out let's talk a little bit about the Tuesday night slate and we'll get to live viewer questions in a bit keep putting those questions in the chat we will hit all of those toward the end of the episode we got about 45 minutes so we'll be on until about 10:15 Central but again keep getting those in the chat and we will hit those Boston OKC one of the most fun games of the year you know a game that I believe Boston led by led by like two or three at the half and okay see goes on a big run in the third quarter they were up as much as 18 at one point and then Boston comes storming back made this a close game came down to three throws at the end but when the dust settled very impressive win for the Oklahoma City Thunder 127 one 23 another huge game for Chad home grin another huge game for SGA who just gives you like 30 606 in his sleep at this point you know Tatum played well poor as they just played well I mean this was this was the rare regular season game that that almost had a playoff field to it and you know I think we expect this for Boston right they're gonna show  up for a game like this but a lot of the reaction last night was okay you know we've always talked about okay see do they have the ammo to make a trade if they want to the question is do they need to make a trade and I would say no and if anything they should I think they should try to shore up some of that bench step rather than you know part ways with one of their key pieces because I want to see this core continue to grow together yeah I mean who are you trying to move off of I like I like everything they've got going on in that starting lineups so yeah maybe you make a move to tweak some things in terms of bench guys or bring in bring in somebody that could be that sort of microwave Off the Bench but they don't need to do anything to change their starting lineup not only is this a team that's winning right now in the regular season with the makeup that they currently have I think it translates to winning in the postseason when you have an elite Bowl Handler that can score at will that you can put the put the ball in their hands leading games and in tight games situations that sort of final two minutes that you look for you have to have a guy like that you know Tatum is that for the Celtics schedule just Alexander is that guy and he can defend so this is this is a team that I think is ascending a lot quicker than maybe we thought that they  would but last night I don't think it's an overreaction to say that could have been a preview of the NBA finals I think it absolutely could be and you know I'm never gonna write off Denver they're what a half game behind OKC right now so it's not like the Thunder are running away with anything their game back of Minnesota and the Western Conference like I Denver to me at full strength is still the team you have to go through but you know other than that do you really trust the Clippers the trust teams like the Lakers or the sun's that's pretty hard to do right now and then you kind of get into some of those other younger unproven teams Minnesota Sacramento New Orleans to me okay see is the class of that that secondary group and you know historically you have to take your lumps you got to make a run or two where you come up short before you make it to the NBA finals but it to me this could be the  the unique year where maybe you don't have to do that just because of the relative lack of a juggernaut in the Western Conference so I'm with you I think that absolutely could be a finals preview I don't think Oklahoma City necessarily needs to do anything to be beefed up this roster but again I think if they could add you know they could add Jordan Clarkson from Utah or even you know Kelly Olynyk I think getting a backup five behind because of General picks up three fouls in the first half of Western Conference Finals game against the nuggets  you know that that would be my concern it's like you know who do you throw at yoke which I don't love that matchup for homegrown I don't know people have said like oh Jared Allen from the Cavs like that'd be great I think you might have to pay a little more than you want yeah well that off you just have about three centers that they could go trade for right I was gonna say the magic Pistons of like eight centers on their roster not that any of them or that appealing but I just think you need like a you need like a 12-minute game bismack biombo type yeah you just need another body that you can throw at them that's all you're trying to do you're not stopping yoke it's just trying not to completely take the your starting big out of the game entirely I'm looking at the odds right now fun the Thunder 20 to 1 to win the NBA championship I think that honestly  I think that may have shifted after last night I think that that's how big that win was I believe that they were there longer odds as of yesterday but this is the one that I would like better is for them to represent the West at nine to one because I still think Boston or if Milwaukee gets there the tough to win that in his seven games series but in terms of representing the West because of all the reasons that you just mentioned the Suns can't stay healthy I don't trust the Clippers as far as I can throw them the Warriors are a broken down version of the themselves the Lakers are old and Denver is still Denver but you're dealing with championship fatigue and guys like Michael Porter's dealt with injuries Jamal Murray's dealt with injuries by dogs oh my God yeah I mean yeah you know you gotta watch out for that you know Eric Gordon don't know what he's going on there a police on that thing but you know it's hard to do it twice we've seen that it's not and it it's not an easy thing to do the greatest teams in NBA history have been able to pull it off are the Thunder that team you know we'll see but I think the Thunder have as good a chance as anybody else and it's not just based on what we saw last night we don't want to sound that overreaction area here on the podcast but I just think it's a little bit of a wake-up call that they absolutely do belong it's not just what they did against Boston they beat Minnesota recently as well they're taking down the heavy weights and they and they're and they're doing it in a way that I think translates to postseason success  I think you're right that we don't want to put too much weight on one game but at some point you got to put weight into these games right there I don't write you know you definitely don't I mean the magic beat the Celtics and they're not winning the Championships so you it's not about one single game it's just that that one game then leads us to talk about something that we were already thinking anyway  yeah exactly and by the way we have a great odds comparison page or ODS tracking page I guess to be more accurate over at RotoWire on our sports betting site so you are right and I'm seeing the Thunder at 22 to one right now to win the finals on DraftKings prior to tip off last night they were 30 to 1 and about two and a half weeks ago they were 50 to 1 wow yeah so I and it's so tough because I feel confident in saying that they've got as good a chance as anybody else and you get some pretty good odds on that but you also feel like you're really miss the boat you know if I'm betting 20 to one knowing that just two weeks ago there was a 50 to 1:30 it's tough to stomach that sort of thing I don't know that I can take the plunge but I would I would just say it's not a bad idea if you're a Futures better  all right I want to hit a few more things and we'll get to The Listener questions again keep throwing those in the chat we'll go rapid fire over the last 15 minutes or so I'm looking at the Yahoo MVPs page so this is the players that appear most frequently on the top 500 fantasy basketball teams hosted on Yahoo and you know we it's kind of been a two-man race between Scotty Barnes and SGA for most of the year we have a new leader as of this morning appearing on 23% of the best teams in fantasy basketball Derek White  wow  that's surprising to me  it's been a very quiet year as far as you know that the numbers that he's putting up I think outside of Boston there's not been a ton of talk about Derek white I think he's like the sixth most talked about player on that team but probably 17 points four rebounds five and a half assists 1.2 steals 1.3 blocks almost 50% from the field almost 90% at the line so I think maybe he's having a better fantasy season than real life I mean it's been a great season in real life but you know comparatively to other players on its own team you don't really notice some of those efficiency numbers but I mean he's been a top 25 player in eighth category leaks  yeah and it's somebody that we probably should have taken a little more seriously and in the pre-draft process because of the opportunity that he was given with the trade of our you know Marcus Smart being shipped off to to Memphis and he played a big role in the playoffs as well so this is this was sort of bubbling to the surface he's a really good player he knows his role and like he's around some of the best players in the NBA so you know this is a little bit like Steve Kerr with the bulls back in the day if you want to real throwback a guy that's just able to shine because when you have to focus your defensive efforts on the Celtics you know not really paying a lot of attention to Derek white but he's efficient enough to get it done yeah I just wanted to highlight that because I think you know again unless you're super locked in you might not realize just how valuable he's been and I know there's been some talk of maybe he sneaks out of the All-Star team in the Eastern Conference we'll see about that but certainly been one of the fantasy all-stars so yeah I drafted him in the Vegas draft that we did at Circa back in July I was sort of stuck in I don't remember what round it was but it was it was later in the draft and that was one of those where we didn't have anything in front of us we're just drafting players off the top of our heads and and I went okay so I need some guard help here who's gonna be a factor that's getting starting minutes and Derek white was was one of them so he's helped he's helping also I think maybe my rosters part of the percentage that one team that I have Derek white it's he's helping a lot you maybe need to draft more teens where you're just like hopping out of the pool sprinting into a cabana and just shouting someone's name and then jumping back into the pool honestly it was it was the it was the best so I I don't disagree with that I think we need to do a quick Story Time by the way so I received a photo out of nowhere over the weekend from Alexis lasowski of him you know kind of bombarding you and what appeared to be Amway arena in Orlando he is center now Peter and we said that's right the kid they're called the Kia center now Amway has been stricken from the record books over at the Downtown Arena so I got a text about two days before the game from Alan saying hey I'm gonna be in Orlando are you gonna be at the magic Knicks game and I said well I work the pregame and postgame for the magic so I'm at every game so I think I might make my way to that one and and he said he we scheduled a meet-up told them where I was at I can't really move from my post and I'm really bad at even though I've been in the same spot for like six years I'm really bad at explaining how to find me in the arena because I know where to go but I don't pay attention to the sections and all of that so credit to him with my shoddy description of how to find me all the sudden you know I'm typing away on my computer I feel tap on my shoulder and there's Alice and we broke it out and we talked about the magic Nicks and how old is Gibson is and then  and then we took a picture and thought you know you and John had to see it so not often that we get to rub shoulders with each other in this virtual remote world that we live in so it was cool to see Alan somebody I really look up to in the fantasy space we had him on the exam show last night he said that was his first NBA game in 15 years  what 15 years wow and he saw magic dub too things of change man I didn't realize he lives in Jacksonville he does he does just chopping it up about Jack's football all the time or what look so I think he's a giant fan he's a Jets fan I believe yes so yeah I mean I mean I made Jaguars fan from Green Bay he's a Jets fan who lives in Jacksonville so we there's not a whole lot of crossover there I mean obviously obvious of where he lives all though I have no ties to the city of Jacksonville been there once  it was fine you know like man I wish I wasn't it didn't feel like a true pilgrimage  right yeah Jackson bills not gonna blow you away they have some nice beaches and they've got the Jags that's about it there are a lot of jean shorts I'll tell you that yeah a lot of jeans shorts and that was as expected all right let's get to the chat here we got some questions piling up again keep getting those and we'll hit as many as we can we got about 15 20 more minutes here Chad says what's up guys what do you think the trade does for Dante demon chenzo's Dynasty value he seems to very clearly be a Tibbs guy and seemed like a future breakout guy before he left the Bucks good question Diva Johnson I think did look like he was on the ascent in Milwaukee had that I believe it's like a foot ankle injury that took him like a year plus to recover from and he was just never quite the same player and obviously Milwaukee had kind of moved into a different phase as a team by the time he was back  and now he's bounced around and feels like he's found what could be kind of a second permanent home now with the Knicks and you know that's something that we didn't really touch on as far as other ramifications from the trade is didn't even shenzo had already been in the starting lineup since mid-December he started 13 games in a row he's played 36 and 26 minutes respectively over the last two games I think we have to view the trade as a positive right you're sending out two guards and you're bringing back a wing in the next did bring back Malachi Flynn as well he's injured and also barely played in Toronto we'll see if he becomes a part of that rotation but yeah I think even chenzo was certainly a winner rest of season and we'll see what the next do this off season but I think if you're talking about dinosaurs evaluate the Arrow's gotta be pointing up yeah for sure and and I think that that was part of what led to the Emmanuel quickly trade I just saw and just reading the Tea Leaves of some angry Nicks fans on Twitter before the trade they were all confused as to why even chenzo was getting a lot of manual Quickly's workload and it seemed like Quickly's minutes were going down not up despite being a really productive player the most be something that Tibbs sees in Donte divincenzo we know how Tom Thibodeau is he gets his mind and his heart set on certain players and then plays them to death and and it seems like Devin chenzo is one of those guys he's still craters out sometimes and it's just not there offensively but but he's a guy look at what he did a couple nights ago capable of 38 points that he scored you don't get to play the Pacers every night but still it effective shooter good three-point shot and is somebody that's gonna be a factor As Long As Trump Thibodeaux the coach  all right couch at TTV says what's up guys what do you think this does for oh wait never mind let's see exact same question we got two different two different chats all right can't have enough Chads yeah all right that one's on me I got Paul says I just traded Booker Kobe white and keyonte George for Donovan Mitchell and CJ McCollum says I'm a little worried about mccollum's health issues what do you guys think so let's yeah let's just do a trade in Alice this year Braden  it's a lot it's seems like a lot to give up Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker I don't view those two all that different in the fantasy space Kobe white I like the idea of moving off of him but I don't think you sold high on him yeah and then and chianti George is a very tradable piece yeah I'm not in love with the deal I would I would say I would give you a c minus yeah I mean I if you're worried about my columns health issues then I don't know why you why you make this deal you know I what we should say is Donovan Mitchell's the best fantasy player in the deal right and I think you still gonna have a nice Runway here with Mobly out with Garland out where he could put up crazy numbers and like as soon as that happened Donovan Mitchell got sick and missed a few games so it's like all right we didn't really see what that could look like I want Mitchell over Booker obviously I want Mitchell over Kobe white I think Kobe white versus McCallum rest of season is like an interesting debate probably lean White  to me I'm not a keyonte George guy Brandon it depends what format you're in like if you're in a point sleep I get it the percentage is the turnovers really kill you in eight or nine cat so like to me that's just kind of a throw-in in the deals so it's like if you're just saying Booker and Kobe white versus Mitchell and McCallum  I I think that's a pretty fair deal either way it's kind of an eye of the holder thing but again if you're worried about mccollum's health I think I would have just tried to hold on to Kobe White  yeah I just don't think that Donovan Mitchell's enough of an upgrade over Devin Booker I know we've got the big three playing together again but Devin Booker's like the defecto point guard and his assistant numbers are gonna be insane I just I think he could have done a little bit better don't hate it but I'm not in love with it with you you already paranoid about CJ I hate trading for guys that I'm already worried about you trade away guys you're worried about  all right Eric says happy New Year guys Happy New Year to you as well Eric I need branded to keep saying good things about frauds Wagner last time he said his field goal percentage would be closer to last year's number he went on that heater thank you guys this is true  well I mean I would love to take the credit for that but it's really funds doing all the work here I eat he figured it out he figured out how to just be more aggressive he's getting to the cup  much with much more frequency I don't know if it was a tired legs thing's playing in the FIBA World tournament and he played all the way through they wanted a championship with Germany they could just took him a minute to kind of get his sea legs under him this year but look at what he's done over the last several games 25 27/32 24 28 and he does it so efficiently he's only shooting over 50% yeah I mean I don't know how much nicer I can get he's playing like legit All Star it's funny because Paolo is probably gonna be the guy I don't think too magic players make it to the All-Stars game but France deserves it over Paolo but Paolo make it because I guess the perception game is that Palos the star of this team friends with what he can do the range that he has Palos gotten better at his three-point shot it's a really good part of fronts Wagner's game and yeah I think he's just been he's been invaluable and he brings it on defense too so I hope that was nice enough for you  I think he's one of the five most underrated players in the league still he's amazing and I don't think I haven't really heard anybody talk about him as an all star and he's absolutely deserving to be in the conversation and I think you're right that  it's a lot to ask for the magic to get to and Ben Carol's the much more popular player you know somebody who's going to do better and an All-Star voting type of situation but yeah there's been incredible fun game last night against the Warriors by the way where hunger played well you know Jalen Suggs it hit a few threes the magic went 14 of 36 as a team I feel like when I was watching the game they missed every wide open three possible I don't know how they got to 14 on the night I think if so just made a couple more they probably win that game I don't know maybe I'll just watching it the wrong time but they got off to a really good start they were there was like 10 to 2 out of the gate and then Steve Kerr called the time out kind of steadied the ship but the magic we're making shots early on in that game I think it helped to buoy some of those percentages that's the issue that you see with this team but it's worth fronts Wagner is so valuable and fantasy but it's frustrating when you watch the magic and IRL in real life because they don't have that other guy that's Paulo and Franz and in the fourth quarter and that's it they don't have anybody else that they can rely on so they've got to figure that out are we are we done with Wendell Carter by the way we got a bunch of questions about him over the last few weeks like you know he's coming off the bench now he started a couple of games he still playing like 20 25 minutes max the numbers have been terrible like we could we just set this aside  for now and not worry about even fantasy yeah I mean in right now Jamal Mosley is I think still hiding behind the the injury ramp up being part of the reason why now he's coming off the bench and go go batas a is getting the starting knot over him go back to say he's just been a better player in terms of in the mix of this starting lineup then Wendell Carter Junior has been I don't know exactly what it is he's dealt with he had a hand injury then came back and dealt with some lower leg soreness so just seems like it's conditioning thing but he's not as good a Defender and this is a team that hangs their hat on defense so Goga isn't going anywhere in terms of fantasy I think you're good to move off of window Carter Jr I know you had a good scoring output a couple of nights ago but it just doesn't seem like he's gonna get the work consistently maybe a guy that you pick up again in the future  all right we got a couple questions from Kim Ron he says I grab quickly drop a gemski hoping that doesn't bite me later I would rather have quickly out of those two you know if you're in a if you're in a deeper League both should be rostered but if you're in a shadow League that's a decision you probably have to make and again I think you did the right thing grabbing quickly he also says realistically how long is Drummond a hole for I mean he's been a machine over the last week and a half as you'd expect as he always is whenever he gets the minutes oh we got an update on Boost earlier this week Brandon I came yesterday morning from for Billy Donovan he said there's no clear return timetable for Nicola said vous will not practice at all this week Bulls play in the second night of a back-to-back tonight they play Friday at home against Charlotte so obviously virtual play in either those games then they're at Charlotte next Monday a couple of home games on a four game week I would say booster which is out until at least the middle of next week we've also seen the Bulls kind of you know play this game was aquiline for the last month and who knows you know trade deadlines coming up all star break is coming up I don't I'd be surprised if it runs that long I don't think they're necessarily holding boots out to treat him and the same way that I think they're doing was Zach LaVine but this very quickly went from oh you know could be a week to could be two to three weeks yeah I'm not exactly sure what's going on in Chicago because I thought for sure they were holding Zach LaVine out for for the trade deadline but now they're talking about ramping him back up and and getting him ready he should be back within the next week so it do they bring him back just so that they can put them in a showcase or why even bother teams know exact Levine is I don't think it's all that necessary it does feel like a similar thing is going on with vouch right now I was dead wrong on Andre Drummond I thought after we saw that 24.25 rebound performance last week that that was that was it we're gonna get that again and he's he's been putting up these ridiculous numbers 16 23 17 rebounds over the last three games he continues to do it if I'm Chicago I'm like why don't I need vouch for look at what Andre Drummond is bringing to the table really turning back the clock these are old school Drummond numbers that we've seen recently yeah  all right let's go rapid fire through the rest of these Brandon we got about five more minutes somewhere out of here Chad says on the Toronto deal just make it less likely that we see any of gradey Dick the rest of the season I say yes just you know again it's kind of the reverse of what we talked about with New York you're sending out a wing and you're bringing back two guards and I know gradey dick has the size and he could conceivably play the three to me is more of a two at the NBA level and I think quickly and bear it obviously take Preston and over that now they did send out Malachi Flynn in some ways a direct competitor for minutes although he's more of a point guard dick more of a shooter a wing I just I think they view this as a developmental year for Grady I think they'll be you know maybe later in the season especially if Toronto really takes a step back I think he could you know see 15 20 minutes if they just want to showcase him at the end of the year but you know they've been bouncing back and forth between the G league so he's obviously much more of a dynasty asset at this point oh for sure I mean this is a guy that he's just not ready for the prime time of NBA basketball just yet they're not ready to put him in that position and we see that more often than not with these rookies of guys that were drafted after the the top 10 gradey dick is  a guy that should turn into a pretty nice NBA player but it doesn't happen for everybody overnight they're just too many good players out there to speculate on to hold gradey dick at this point Austin asks Draymond and keldon Johnson for Jalen Johnson and Donte divincenzo who wins that trade 10 team points League I'll let you answer first  well I'm just not all that interested in having dream on green on my team we still have no idea when he's gonna come back so I feel like that's sort of a dead piece to this deal Kelvin Johnson okay but he can be somewhat erratic like what I'm saying that have done to even chenzo we talked about him and Jalen Johnson what a surprise piece he's been for the Hawks this year so I think the second part of that deal is the is the winner here specially in the ten Team league  yeah I think with it being a point Sleek I like I like Draymond and I like Calvin Johnson more but I still prefer the jail Johnson even chenzo side of this one aunt says I need threes and I'm willing to trade to buy his Harris who can I get in return so by Sarah 7 a nice year as he always does he's going to somehow finish like 50th right where he does every season but you need you need high volume three pointers so  hmm you can attach somebody Tobias Harris you know somebody a little bit lesser and you know maybe you target someone like CJ McCollum someone like Terry Rozier someone like Tyler hero you know guys who ranked ahead of Tobias Harris and again you'd probably need to attach an asset there if you're just you know if you're just targeting three-pointers then I think you can name a little bit lower and you know like Bogdan bogdanovich has been hitting a ton oh yeah I'm plugged into Detroit you know Devin vassell these are all guys that are averaging at least two and a half threes per game you know Michael Porter Max Drew so those guys are all in that conversation  he could get a couple of those heat guys as well Tyler hero Duncan Robinson would be somebody that you could Target we talked about Derek white I mean he's when we mentioned earlier 23% of of winning Fantasy Basketball rosters right now so maybe you want to get a hold of him I don't think that's information that many people know so if you had Derek white it looks like that's translating to wins a he would be somebody that I would be willing to Target Fred Van Vleet in Houston guys like that  quick question not Draymond what is he back and he updates start of next week maybe maybe the Warriors we got like her on the podcast real quick yeah I mean we have it's been over a week since we've had any sort of update in the last one said he the suspension May last 11 to 13 games like okay very strange time period that came from woes if that timetable were to hold up that would mean he could be back as soon as this Friday or sometime in the next week I don't know I mean the dream I think I feel like we're just gonna we're gonna find out like the morning of a game he's just gonna be back you know it's very vague it's a unique situation there's not really a blueprint for a player having to kind of check off boxes like this so my guess is these back in the next two weeks I'd be pretty surprised if it extends beyond that but even so I just I still don't really want him in fantasy it's been a diminishing asset I think for a few years now yeah I mean look at what you were getting before the suspension it wasn't really anything that was I think driving wins for you and maybe Nick is right that it just you wake up one morning and all the sudden dream on green is back and active I have a feeling  there's gonna be more of a ramp up process where the first report you get is dream on green is back with the Golden State Warriors that'll be the headline and we don't even have that yet it seems like both sides are it's like it's like Ross and Rachel from Friends they're on a break right now and they are not speaking to each other all right Steve-O says I got offered cat in kaminga for OG in Claxton this is a 12 team 11 cat League  this is a really really interesting trade because obviously caps the best player on the deal because the worst player in the deal OG and Claxton combined I think this is fair it's something that it was almost a trade that I would be like terrified to make because I feel like I'm getting hurt one way or the other which means it's probably a good trade  yeah and I'm I like the fantasy viability of OG and Obi with the with the Nicks at least as of right now it's  it's a good player in a new scene fresh new toy kind of feeling so I I do worry that sometimes we do this in every sport whether it's fantasy basketball baseball football when we get a semi star player and a New Jersey we tend to overrate them a little bit so I worry that that could be happening here but definitely like what I've seen don't want to just dismiss it entirely I liked what I saw from comingo last night and watching that magic Warriors game 19.6 rebounds four assists a couple of block shots if that's the kamminga that we're going to get the first side of that deals definitely the winner I would still take cat and Camano but I think it's a very interesting offer to ponder Ivy Brandon Miller cam Johnson who do you want rest of the way 14 Team league  mmm I I think I would go with Brandon Miller quietly a guy that is in the Rookie of the Year conversation won't win it because the the two guys that are in front of him I've been so incredible but he is he has been really good in his own right really good outside shooter and it just seems like he's really comfortable out there gonna continue to get more of a Runway especially with all the injuries the Hornets have been dealing with and some of the old guys that could end up shipping off like Gordon Hayward  last 18 games for Brandon Miller 16 points 3 and a half rebounds two and a half assists about one and a half deals and blocks combined 43 45 87% ages so right that's if you go percentage what you worry most about with him and you know it's gonna go up and down but he's been on a really nice run and you know is it a tough spot to Charlotte's getting just how was basically every night except for last night against the Kings so yeah I would I think Miller versus Johnson is really interesting cam Johnson to me is probably the safer option it kind of depends like you know where you are in your league it's like if you're choosing one of the other if you need to move up the standings maybe I just answered with Brandon Miller I think they can't just gonna give you a more consistent 15.7 rebounds a couple threes better percentages Ivy is just not a consideration here I'm still interested intrigued by what he could be as a player going forward he's in a different like fantasy category for me than the other two yeah it and as much as I can get away from players on the Pistons with the last name that isn't Cunningham I'm I'm good doing that  all right well  and other Pistons question from Chad he said one more question who do you think ends up getting shipped out from the gluts of same type of players in Detroit great question this could in a lot of ways you know shape the fantasy landscape if you're if you're working on the margins the rest of the way I'm going to say boyade bug data Vic probably gets traded at some point yeah he's the most likely really  had you get traded other than cage I you know I think Isaiah Stewart would have suitors I think you know I mean even even guys like Alec Burks Joe Harris you know that's like there are some teams that maybe just want some veteran depth later in the season but I guess the question is one who gets shipped out to who benefits I'm yeah the shipped out part I think is easier to figure out like donovick is tier one in terms of if you were if you were setting odds in Vegas he'd be like minus 300 to be dealt at the deadline and then Isaiah Stewart Marvin Bagley probably would be next I think those those guys are killing Haze so wouldn't be surprised if he got traded in terms of who gets a bump I mean Kate Cunningham's already he's not gonna get a bump if anybody leaves he is what he is I think it could honestly be Jaden Ivy and I think if he just ends up in with more usage maybe he develops more into a player that we like in fantasy assault Thompson maybe he comes back into our good Grace's but I don't I don't think I'd feel I mean where do you land on that I don't feel great about anybody if a couple of these players end up getting shipped off I'll just kind of shrugged my shoulders and go okay this is what it looks like now I think a SARS the obvious one because we've already seen it but no you kind of said what was on my mind which is like all right let's say they trade you know trade alerts trade Joe Harris trade Isaiah Stewart it's like all right Kevin Knox time baby like are you really excited for Isaiah livers like yeah it's a it's a weird situation because the minutes would be there and technically the production would be there but I'm not I'm not super fired up about any of those guys so I think it's more about volcano where does he end up just his value slide you know if he ends up on a contending team where he's not being asked to do quite as much yeah it's  it's not a good situation in Detroit I think that's pretty much all we could say about that all right fellas we got to be on our way out Brandon appreciate chat with you as we do every Wednesday morning we'll be back at this time next Wednesday we'll have Alex Ken and on Friday we will
