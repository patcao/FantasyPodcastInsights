is February 22nd 2024 today we're coming off of our first slate of games following the All-Star break and I'm joined by Kyrie and Sprecher for the first time making his podcast debut he is one of our NBA editors which is doesn't mean anything to anybody because they don't know what you do but I will say this if you've read a single NBA news update on RotoWire in the past two years it's like a one in five chance Kyrie and wrote it  you have I don't know if you know this if you can if you can find this on the NBA on our RotoWire internal database you have 11,000 700 MBA notes to your name which is the sixth most in company history uh and you're doing a lot more behind the scenes than that so I'm happy to have him on the podcast today how are you doing kirian  I'm doing great thanks Alex that was a great introduction um I I used to be more aware of the number of notes I had written earlier in my career and now that I'm an editor I check it like once a year but  I think I'm still like 50 like I I need like 10,000 more to even crack like the top five so that's six plus gonna be there for a long time but you know hopefully you know a couple more years and I'll get to that 20,000 Mark yeah I'm I'm right behind Nick I think I need like a hundred to pass Nick I really have to I should just make like end of the year effort just but this this is this got me down a rabbit hole the other day when I was looking this up but between Nick Nick Whalen who people listen this pot over that is curion me and Jason chabil ski one of our other NBA agenda's the four of us have written more than 15% of Rota wires NBA notes since the dawn of mankind not just this year but since the company was founded in 1997 we were responsible for 15% of the notes written which is crazy I can't even believe that but I want to jump in This I Promise everybody listens to the Pod this will be the last time that we talked about All-Star festivities I feel like you get like a week buffer and then it's over so I have three questions for you Karen  one do you like all star weekend because apparently this is a controversial topic some people just hate it  two did you like this all-star weekend and three is there anything if you did not like all star weekend maybe even if you did is there anything you would change Above All Star weekend  I do like the all-star weekend it's not my favorite event I always tune in for at least some of the events Rising Stars challenge 3-point contest I always give the dunk contest at least a little bit of a chance and see where it goes the All-Star game itself it's always fun to watch for a first the first few quarters watching guys Chuck from Deep Damian Lillard hitting half court shots that's always fun to watch  but then when it starts to get into 20 point game and there's gonna be no competition at the end I kind of tune out so I do like it I did like this one  I didn't necessarily like the All-Star game itself that much this year I tuned out halfway through the third quarter when the league got big I really enjoyed Sabrina verse staff I hope they do more of that yeah  I really like the rise in All Stars or the rising stars on format that was super fun mathura and Ivy going at each other and getting all of those young players like Incorporated and playing on a stage like that that's really fun you know you see math and like really shine in that moment there was a funny bit with Halliburton and Myles Turner and mathura and they won the skills competition or whatever as a team and Hal Burton's like you know team we're a good team we're like we're the Pacers this was fun and in Indiana to win this thing it was the highlight of my week he's like I'm not sure about Benedict because obviously he got the MVP of the rides and stars and that's more of an individual things so I like that um math and getting to show his his star power if he ever gets a chance to do that if there was one thing I would change  I think  I think the Three-Point Contest is the like the gold the Nugget of the weekend right and that should be the final thing um like it should come after the dunk contest like I feel like the Three-Point Contest happens Sabrina verstappen and then the dunk contest and all of the air got let out of the balloon so that's like one minor tweak but overall I'm not like that big of a cynic I do understand why people like tune out of the All-Star Game I feel like a lot of the the hatred towards it comes from better sadly who are like all star game you know and then they're watching what's happening this is terrible so like you know don't put on the All-Star Game maybe but Nick was talking to me about he bet the All-Star Game and he was like I'm never doing this again but he bet I forget I think he hit a couple on threes overs I'm like that's the move if you're gonna bet the All-Star game back on everybody to go over their three-pointers because everyone just gets up to half court and just Chucks it  be I I agree with you on the Three-Point Contest I mean I love the Don contest don't contest is my favorite event it always has been I love the creativity it's a lot of fun it's worth all the bad dogs to get like one donkey never seen before but yeah I agree with you I think it's actually it might serve Burger as a warm up to the Three-Point Contest I do I agree with you take about the rising stars Rising Stars has become almost more fun than the actual All-Star Game  but yeah I remember last year last year when I was watching the All-Star game I was sent on my couch I just found myself like scrolling my phone for most of the game not even like that engaged this year I I checked the highlights so um yeah as on the MBA app as it was happening so yeah I was it was fine but let's get into some real MBA news we have unfortunate news for everybody who has been rostering and yakka Kong we're waiting for a breakout All Season not only to Clint capela not get traded we have a Kong woo out for the quote for Seibel future now  I guess my question is  do you think we're basically just going to get a variation of what we saw when Clint capela was out because capella was out before the All-Star break we saw some more Bruno Fernando for like 10 to 18 minutes Kong woo was playing 30 minutes and then Jalen Johnson will get some minutes at small ball 5 do you think the same thing is going to happen with a Kong wow capella plays more I guess my follow-up to that in a way is like Ken Capelli even handle 30 minutes the game at this point for the rest of the season yeah we've been waiting for the Congo breakout for years feels like but it hasn't come quite yet he was budding but  it's it's sad to see him go down for what the Hawks rotation is going to look like I think obviously it's safe to expect more of the same I do think that  DeAndre Hunters presence will be a big factor here he was he was also out one capella was our um when a Congo was out earlier in the season so if you can run out of run out Jalen Johnson at the small ball five more often and then you have Hunter and Bay at the two forward spots that's still a small lineup but I feel like that gives them a lot of size in the front court at least  to like combat that and plus I feel like that's just like the highest upside front court that they can throw out there so I would personally like to see that I'm not saying that that's what's gonna happen that's what I'm predicting what's gonna happen it's a safe bet to assume Fernando's gonna get that 15 minutes per game sort of deal I would like to see him more closer to 10 with Bay and Hunter and Johnson all 30 plus but well I that would be the most advantageous for Fantasy managers obviously because Bay and Hunter and Johnson are all rostered in a lot of leaks so I  that's what I would hope and like expect out of  Atlanta but realistically we're probably going to see a lot of Fernando which reduces the fantasy value of all of those guys I mentioned yeah Fernando might be worth adding if you're in like a super deep League off the double check on Atlantis schedule to see if they have I'm pulling it up right now they only have three games this next week so it's not like a great streaming opportunity DeAndre Hunter you mentioned having good had good back-to-back games 20 points in back-to-back only played 28 minutes and each so yeah this may be a situation where it's just it's just bad for everybody like it's just bad for a Kong woo if you're rostering him I guess it's good if you have Capello but speaking of big men  Isaiah Stewart suspended three games do do to an altercation with Drew Eubanks that he had I think it was in the parking lot I don't exactly remember they dropped the they dropped the charges but the league still suspended I had suspended Stewart for three games Pistons did not play yesterday so that is upcoming Stuart hasn't played since January 28th has not played in February so this is mostly just like annoying if you're rostering him but I it's a good chance to talk about the Pistons because he will return eventually very soon and so how do you think his presence when he comes back into the rotation is going to affect how the Pistons look post deadline  totally  real quick my little conspiracy theory is maybe Isaiah Stewart would have missed even more games with this ankle injury and they just kind of boosted him to questionable and kind of nudge the MBA to be like hey he's gonna be playing soon so you might want to suspend him so they might this totally get away with him still being injured and then having to serve the suspension I have I have no sources on that that's totally conspiracy theory um you know Isaiah Stewart's a solid player him moving to the four with Jalen Duren there has opened up more 3-point opportunities but then has reduced his blocks so he's still kind of like stagnant as a fantasy option as for how the rotation will look don't get me started on Monty Williams band I I had a lot of faith in him turning around Detroit I wanted to I gave him a lot of credit for what happened in Phoenix and then you know we won't get into all of that and I still had high hopes for him this season has been a huge disappointment all across the board he recently said I'm I'm done with prioritizing development and we're gonna win now and then in the first game following the All-Star break he benched Cade Cunningham in the first quarter and they proceeded to go down by 30 if you're trying to win no you got to play your best players man and then I came comes back in the second half and they make it kind of respectable or whatever and I get he's trying to make a point like we're gonna win now I'm  benching my best player everyone but then you're bringing in Marcus I like Marcus Sasha too but like you're bringing in these guys off the bench and it's just not it it's not Cade Cunningham I'm not saying he's an MVP candidate or anything but he's your best player and he's gonna give you the best chance to win games and he showed that when he got an opportunity so money Williams say like whatever he says to the media you can't take it um you got to take it with a grain of salt fontecchio has been playing really well at the four obviously he's probably the one that moves to the bench with Stuart comes back  then you also they also added guys like Fournier  at the deadlines that will add shooting that they haven't had I think Thompson still gets  like I don't know I don't think he gets pushed out of the rotation completely when Stuart comes back he's been playing really well and as Monty Williams says we're not we're not going for development and anymore we probably should be at this point so I'm not really sure what any of that means  I would just probably stay away from all Pistons  outside of Cunningham Ivy and dirt during um those guys are pretty solid right now you can trust them outside of that he it's gonna be ugly started coming back  probably has the biggest impact on fontecchio who was probably being picked up in deeper League's around this point of the season because of his 3-point shooting and his the minutes that he's played since being traded their butt ya fantasy was a good streamer a good streamer for a lot of the season um yeah I was I was looking through their recent rotation  clearly they are trying to win because they're playing veteran Evan Fournier proven winner so I think you know I think with Stuart comes back yes fonte could move to the bench but if you look at their you know if you look at their average the team's average minutes over the past like was just say three games basically you know you got again 18 to 20 minutes for four years setting there a shake Milton's been playing like 10 to 15 minutes Troy Brown's been getting minutes muscala it's like I think these guys can all just get their benefits cut Stewart can come in for 30 minutes and all the guys that we want to play will play from the most part but yeah make sure if you if your roster anybody from the Pistons just to keep an eye on what happens when I say Stewart  does come back before we move on to our next news item I do want to say thank you for all the questions in the chat everybody we will get to those in about five ten minutes we'll do a quick questions we'll hit questions and we'll go to waiver wire after that we also got some more news from the Memphis Grizzlies uh their mass unit Desmond Bane likely out until mid to late March is the latest update and then Marcus Smart will be reevaluating in three weeks that being March 27th  I respect that Bain really wants to come back he shouldn't he should not come back it doesn't make any sense I think the only argument because you don't want to get hurt for next year right I mean forget this year but just like they're gonna be competitive next year don't give them hurt for next year I think the only argument for for like wanting to bring Bane back is  Memphis might be basically locked into their draft spot  where the potential win loss change of Bane playing versus not I don't think it matters that much because they have so right now they have 20 wins the Grizzlies do Toronto also has 20 wins they're tied for the sixth first record with Memphis but they owe Toronto owes their pick to the Spurs if it's seven or farther out which I could not believe they gave up this one to six protected pick for yakka portal insane  but then way below Memphis is Portland with 15 wins you're not getting their Charlotte is 14 you're not you're not reaching Port literally with 15 wins like those guys are gonna Outlaws you the rest of the way Brooklyn has 21 wins but they owe their picked a Houston so they have no getting second to Tank Houston is 24 wins but they all they're picked OKC so they're trying to win too Atlanta also is 24 wins so that's like the only team long story short  you know people love to listen to me ran off standing over over audio they'd love that long story short what if you're a fantasy manager you roast or something in the Grizzlies you roster Bane you roster any of these guys who have emerged for the Grizzlies what is this update mean to you  pretty much what we expected from the beginning right there if they're going to come back they're going to come back in the final weeks of the regular season however  even if they do come back they might be limited because why would you want to risk two of your better players  that could be key players on a competitive team next year  also they just might never come back and the deadlines or the return date might keep getting pushed back as a fantasy manager I mean if you have them like if you a rostering them and you have access to an IR spot you probably already have them in those slots and you can keep them there  you know without any risk  if you have another say you have like Julius Randle and Desmond Bane I'm probably dropping Desmond Bane with like hoping Julius Randle comes back before Desmond Bane I don't really know if there is really anything  any of like other examples like that don't really come to mind I'm totally content keeping these two guys in the IR spot hoping that they come back for maybe like a postseason postseason run  but I wouldn't be expecting that and if you need another if you need access to that IR spot you probably can drop these guys if you're trying to make a push to the playoffs if you're a contending team and you're like I'm gonna make the playoffs you can probably still hold them but if you're like I need to win these next couple weeks or I need to move up in the standings  you probably can move on  Yeah you mentioned Julius Randle there we had a question on the Chad j Hank 20 what to do with Randall is he even tradeable I don't think he's tradeable I think you should hang on I mean the hope is that he can like maybe come back in early to mid-march but we just haven't gotten great updates yet he hasn't resumed basketball activities so I think optimistically you'd probably be looking at mid-march yeah um it's tough to say I would just hang on I would just hang on in your IR I don't it's it's too he could come back too soon for you to you know to be worth dropping him so that's a tough question all right two final news notes before we quickly get to questions Kyle Lowry made his 76ers debut last night Gordon Hayward Megan's Thunder debut Lawrence was much better play 25 minutes five of seven shooting for 11 points five rebounds excuse me five assists for rebounds took a minute away from campaign a little bit from buddy hield who was playing like 40 minutes a game that was absurd Gordon Hayward for the Thunder played 14 minutes was horrible zero points at over two shooting for rebounds interestingly we saw Jada Williams the big was a DMP CD with Corbin hey we're going to line up so something I was not expecting to happen there  any I mean do you have any takeaways from that from both either of those situations  Colorado Lottery was playing man he 25 minutes is a lot he was really fishing from the field you know obviously his shooting comes and goes with Joel embiid out the Sixers are going to need all hands on deck and he's one of their arguably one of their best players at this point I'm not condoning picking them up off waivers yet I still like Maxi and healed and Harris and Uber a to kind of like lead this offense but the hometown kid is gonna get a lot of minutes down the stretch run until mum and  they are struggling and they're gonna need all of the veteran experience they can get so keep an eye on Lowry I'm not ready to pull the trigger off of one like mediocre performance but it was a it was a good first game for him for sure Heyward offensively you know he hasn't played in a long time there's a lot of rust he I was impressed with his defensive ability he was moving around well he looked fluid he fits that system well I was so surprised that Jalen Williams was the one out of the rotation um I think  hold on let me check quick I think  um yeah sorry I lost it  I think giddy also played fewer minutes yeah guinea pig only 23 minutes that's kind of been like his role so Jalen Williams was really the only one like majorly infected by that by hayward's presence I assume he's gonna be getting more towards that 20 minute Mark as he gets more acclimated to his new team to I would stay away from Hayward for now but keep an eye on Lowry  yeah but did any belt in allegedly is going to come back soon that's gonna maybe affect as minutes Heyward I think he was just getting acclimated to the offense you mentioned it yeah I played a while so I won't be surprised I still believe he's gonna be 20 to 30 minutes a game when he's fully like integrated  but yeah you don't want to  not encouraging performance know we also have final news item here Jordan Poole came off the bench last night  interim head coach Brian Keith said it's really a positive it's actually a credit to Jordan's been why the highest net ratings since I've taken over and I want to see more of that this gives him an opportunity now being in that unit to be the lead Handler lead decision maker and kind of be our offensive engine that is true I'm just not sure it's just crazy to me we're benching him it's actually that's great that's good he's playing so well that we had to bench him he's too good for the starting lineup that's the problem anyway but I'll call a bali started for him last night pool if you're in a points League  you're not that mad about this performance but a category League he did shoot four of 17 for 18 points Kula Bali didn't do much Four Points 32 minutes  does this really change anything for you or is this just  maybe more shot volume for pool minutes are basically the same you know what do you think yeah I think minutes basically are gonna stay the same he still played 30  the shot attempts might not be a great thing if you're in category leaks like that might be even worse than what he was doing before um I still like Jordan Poole as a as a player I have I hope he can turn it around it's it's a mindset thing I think for me he's got all the skills Washington  Kyle kuzma was really the only one that we need to care about that there for now on  pool has had success Off the Bench though someone of his best games  during the warrior during his Warrior's tenure came off the bench so I wouldn't be surprised if you kind of finds a group with the second unit kind of like a you know a show like  you got bench so now you gotta show me and he kind of plays well in that role sometimes so we'll see don't have the highest expectations but  points League points League I'm still probably wrote Blake rolling with him with the shot attempts but category leaks if I don't I don't trust that field goal percentage at all  no and you know if you're looking to stream anybody from the wizards they have only have three games next week not ideal I mentioned kispert you know on the on the Pod last week playing well same with audio just had five points after he scored a career high so that's that's classic move  but yeah let's get to some of these listening or questions you got talk about them in the chat we'll try to get to all of them but we don't want to run too long so apologies if we don't get to yours Ian has concerns about DeAndre ayton he's okay Nine Cats 16 Team league would you trade them would you hold them if trade what rank range yeah I mean I'm going to be weary of anybody on a team like you know Portland or Charlotte or like any of these bottom feeder teams I mean guys like eight and it's not really a veteran I guess that's the only saving grace here right in is not really a veteran  I don't know carrying if you if you had eight nine a team I don't know if you do are you trying to move off of him I do not have eaten on any teams um  I probably am not I mean I would send out some feelers  you but I don't know really like what kind of reception you're gonna get from your league mates he before taking away his dud in the final game before the All-Star break he was averaging 19 points 11 rebounds and one block over his last nine appearances that appeared in nine of the last 10 games that's pretty solid production I don't think anyone's gonna like trade you a guy that's gonna like match that production  so I feel like there's a hold and unless you get like a great offer there is definitely concerns about the shutdown and your league mates are probably concerned about that too so it it all depends on what kind of return you can get  if you're gonna trade him for like  a GG Jackson like that's it just doesn't seem like an advantageous move like on either side I I don't I don't think anyone's going to be like oh I want to get eight and overpay for him so I think you just roll with the production you get in you write it leads where you're putting turnovers he's ranked 59th on the season and actually 24 over the past month if you can get a top 60 player for him  that's fine you know that's fine if you have so if you have more confidence in somebody but I wouldn't be freaking out to move off of him he's 25 years old maybe they'll actually try to feature him more down the stretch it's a bit of a risk award play but that's a good question  uh thoughts like I say a heartening is Mitchell Robinson coming back  hard to Stein have been dealing with Achilles injury had missed a handful of three games before the break just came back last night played 11 minutes  ever they're gonna be careful with Achilles injuries right so do I have concerns I have mild concerns but he also reached 30 minutes before  is Mitchell Robinson coming back I would guess probably not before the fantasy season is over  I will say because it's like Achilles injury I would sell high if you can if anybody's willing to trade for somebody who's just played 11 minutes off of Kelly's injury but I wouldn't worry about Mitchell Robinson at the very least I would totally agree with that hartenstein has been a darling after Robinson's gone down the 11 minutes off the Achilles injury there wasn't any reported setback so I'm not too concerned with that Paul Reed also played only 22 minutes with the Sixers running out of small ball line up most of the game so this the next kind of probably were just like hey you know we don't need to push her and Stein we'll just run precious or topping or Jericho Sims out there at the five so I I'm still like holding on that 11 minutes wasn't like a he suffered a step back or he's only gonna be playing 15 minutes for the next week and it was just kind of like the style of that game  yeah we've gotten this question a lot is indeed a safe drop and they play off schedule week 22 23 24 I saw this question  and believe it or not I did the prep work week 22 begins March 25th and right now we have Joel embiid's estimated return date based off of reporting as April 2nd  so that that would be the early portion of his return date  so if I'm you and my playoffs start  March 25th they go April 1st and then their final playoff week if you get to the finals is April 8th through the 14th even if indeed comes back let's say he comes back April 8th  is he gonna be playing 30 minutes a game  is he gonna be playing I don't I don't know what they're back to back schedule is like I apologize for not having now off the top of my head but  I would not  I don't think you'll lose your league if you drop in beat that's what I'll say I thank you at some point you just need to get production  I totally agree  the only caveat that I have is the Sixers are two games away from falling to the acid after that there's a big like the play in tournament there you know they're just gonna be stuck in the plane tournament that's the way it's trending now I don't feel like they would if they're falling in that direction I don't think they rush and be back to be like let's get the sixth seed or you know so I  I think he's a safe drop you gotta get production eventually if you're trying to make the playoffs you're trying to win holding on doing bead does nothing for you at this point when he does come back he's probably gonna be limited and they're just gonna they're  us they're not locked into the play on spot but they're essentially locked into the playoff playing spot so there's no reason for him to come back like early early to make it that big of a difference  Glenn says should I pick up Gordon Hayward he just dropped Uncle Robinson unfortunately I had bad news for you I'm suggesting Duncan Robinson as a pickup this week later in the show and Gordon Hayward played badly I still think we're at the decent long-term pickup if you're in like a 16 Team league I do I do not hate the idea of a flyer on him but it's Dan look good for him I'm Yakko holder drop we talked a little bit about canggu earlier  I'll say I'm leaning with me being fine that you drop them but what's what's your opinion Gary in  yeah he wasn't gonna be a League winner  anyways I double double production he was kind of like stealing more minutes away of compel so that that would be nice but I think he's probably a drop at this point  uh Jay Sizzle wants to drop Walker Kessler for either a sar Thompson or Grant Williams and a nine Cat 10 team had to head do you have any insight carrying hmm  it depends I mean Grant Williams is a reigning it from Deep right now if you need help in if you think you can win games if you can get if you can get help in the 3-point category and that will help you win games I think Grant Williams is definitely the move there we talked a little bit about Thompson May losing minutes when I do Isaiah Stewart comes back so I feel like Grant Williams is the safer play I'm also it's a little foreshadowing I'm also highlighting him in my waiver wire pickups  well let's let's get to those waiver wire pickups thank you everybody for the questions we'll hit some questions after or waiver wire section to close out the show  so stick around for that as always or for people who are new here these were just as they're all under 50% roster God Yahoo and at least one of our suggestions will always be under 25% roster but I know Kieran you have a list of like four or five a handful of guys who are still under 50% roster that we continue to recommend to people so why don't you list those off for us yeah so we got trained man at 47% rostered Chianti Georgia 45 Murray Begley at 49 and Gigi Jackson at 41% these guys are all still below that 50% threshold that we're trying to hit in Yahoo League's and they've been mentioned in numerous articles on RotoWire I've heard him in numerous podcasts these guys have varying skill sets but each player can make an impact in both points and category leaks so I don't think there's like really much to see there if I had to pick one I'm probably wrong with Gigi he's been phenomenal recently and I'm just kind of riding the hype train although I will add that keyonte George is like my breakout for next year like I think he he is going to be awesome the Jazz are kind of like bringing him along slowly this  year but he's he's gonna be a Cornerstone for them for a long time I just don't know if that's gonna happen in the next six weeks Memphis oh go ahead I was just I just remained shocked by Gigi Jackson's efficiency considering how garbage he was in college yeah no it's amazing and Memphis has nothing to lose what's wrong about we talked about smart and Bain coming back and it's like why bring those guys back and risk injury when you can just see what Gigi has to offer and Vince Williams azir Williams like they got they got a lot of young guys that can get minutes  the other caveats are trained man could see a reduced role of lamelo ball comes back I don't know if that's going to happen but it's just a possibility which knocks him down a little bit for me Begley's double-double production is nice and he has a safe floor with gaffer in Dallas now but I just don't really want to trust any Wizards outside of Kyle kuzma so I'm probably rolling with GG out of that group before  okay let's let's get into the meat and potatoes here I'm Gonna Go My First suggestion is Trey Murphy of the New Orleans Pelicans who is about 50% rostered by I want to I just want to highlight him even though he's you know a little higher roster and some of these guys and Daniels quietly was playing like 20 minutes a game like every single night for the Pelicans out for at least a month with a meniscus injury probably more than a month Daniels he missed he has missed the past four games which they Pelicans played last night as well they blew out the rockets in those past four games Trey Murphy 15 points per game on 44 30 for 78 shooting for rebounds 1.5 assists two Steals and two blocks in 30 minutes the minutes are really encouraging I think the efficiency will increase because he shot 48 41.91 last year so I think this is gonna uptick so I I think Murphy could average like 16 17 points a game for the rest of the season not to mention branding Ingram and Zion Williamson both injury-prone stat last night we know about Zions injury history as well so I think if you're he's probably Murphy's probably roster already in like 905% of competitive 12 teams if you're in a 10 team member he might be out there I think yeah I think he is worth a pickup  absolutely I totally agree I'm one other thing I would add there is the Pelicans are hot right now and when he's when the Pelicans are playing well they get open looks for Shooters because they attack the paint so much so I think Pelicans are hot and you ride in Murphy like on who is your first waiver wire suggestion so outside of those top four I'm Gonna Roll with another one of my favorite guys that I I was really high on before the season it hasn't quite happened yet maybe we're getting a little bit of that now it really hachimura he started seven straight games he had a career high 36 point performance before the All-Star break he's averaging 16 points four and a half rebounds nearly two assists and 1.4 stocks when playing at least 30 minutes this season he's done that's he's played at least 30 minutes 12 times  he was a key part of the Lakers run to the Western Conference finals last year which was why I was high on him coming into the season he scored in double figures and eight of his 16 appearances during that stretch including 420 point out ins and then he just hasn't really gotten that type of run this year consistently there's been some moments from the Bronson sits or you know someone sits and he gets extra minutes but just hasn't been consistent I last night well he didn't have a great performance I think he's the only starter and that didn't score in double figures but I really think he benefits from point guard LeBron I think when point guard LeBron is when LeBron is playing point guard that opens up more opportunities and LeBron really likes hachimura and hachimura can be really efficient as that like third or four score it's a risky play but I think it's a play that you should make if you're trying to like push for a playoff spot if you're in that like you're right out of the playoffs and you think you can go he has a really high ceiling probably a decently low or low but he's a he's a risky play that could pay off well in the end  yeah I you know when she wore was in Washington I was I was kind of a Hachi more hater I was like I don't I don't really get it but he was awesome with the playoffs last year really physical great got shooting I agree as I mean it's a you know concerning his he's a pretty 22% rostered for a guy who look he could explode and have like 30 points in that 30 points in a week like 30 points in two games or you know he could get you 50 points across a week or something like that so that is a good option  my second suggestion Duncan Robinson of the Miami Heat 28% roster  uh this is more of like a week's like a next week's streamer rather than necessarily like a long-term pickup because what we have is Terry Rozier remains weak to week he did shed his brace recently oh I don't think he's been doing a ton of work Josh Richardson still out with the shoulder injury is going to be reevaluated next week but they basically he basically have no guards aside from Tyler hero who I think missed missed their most recent game  Jimmy Butler just came back but the past three games for Duncan Robinson 19 points he's shooting 60% from three three point three assists two rebounds and one steal again you welcome for the threes  again mostly streamer for next week the heat up four games so Roman for next week get your I don't know 16 3 pointers and then see what happens after that  totally agree Robinson's been a very solid play at points during the season and next week is definitely one of those where he has a lot of opportunities my next guy we already alluded to it a little bit I'm going with Grant Williams and four games of Charlotte he's averaging nearly 19 points five and a half rebounds two assists and he's shooting 49.93 43 shooting splits during those games I was shooting regression overall is likely he's never really pushed 50% for a full season but he shot above 30% from deep in four straight Seasons so I don't think that the three-point shooting is going to wane as long as the minutes are still there his peripheral stats are sporadic 10 and 8 rebound games but then he just had four rebounds in the other two so that's kind of a little bit concerning doesn't get many assists occasional steals I think he's a safer play I don't think you know the Hornets might start to tank bench guys but like I don't think they're gonna be prioritizing leaky black and Davis bertans over a guy like Grant Williams you know you want to give Williams some as much as many minutes as you can to like at least stay some what competitive I think this is a great move for a team that's probably like in the middle of the postseason right now or like there in like the middle of the postseason standings like you you're probably gonna make it and you just sort of looking for a little bit of boost in that three-point percentage if you're in a cat league for that championship that you're looking to make yeah this is I think mostly a three streamer move but he is he's being more aggressive on offense I mean double digit shot attempts and every game I just played for Charlotte is free throw rate is way up since getting to Charlotte so yeah I mean I I've been pretty I was creating at the very beginning of the year I was like you need to sell hiring Grant Williams like today but now he's the role is is expanded so I'm not going to be as critical about him Hornets at four games next week too yeah I don't know if you mention that so stream them stream them in for sure  my next player I'm Ben Thompson Houston Rockets 43% roster  this may seem conquer intuitive it is a little bit because Fred Van Vleet just came back but Thompson played 28 minutes off the bench last night  he had 22 points five rebounds four assists three blocks  I have to know it was a blowout they the the Rockets were decimated by by the Pelicans so  you know it's hard to say how many of those minutes were complete garbage  but what we do know is email idka he talks about this all the time we know it from him as a coach he loves energy guys love guys who play hard on defense because I'm on um I also think there's a chance that tari Eason just does not play again this season the injury they keep it is injury situations getting weird it's in weird Zone with howdy they're being about it  but yeah it's fine it's possible that I've been plays 19 minutes next game completely on the table but so keep that in mind before you pick them up you know if you have someday waivers you know see what happens they play again I think they play again on Sunday so keep an eye and see what happens but but he could still be worth rostering the rest of the year I think  absolutely I like both of the Thompson brothers I think amen has a little bit higher of an upside right now but  I would be totally fine rostering him  so my last one I'm also rolling with the rookie he got his first career start last night  near Double-Double one rebound away and 26 minutes he's played over 20 minutes five times this season and averaged 10 points four and a half rebounds and one steal so nothing like too crazy  but I just like want to stress the importance of a rookie starting the second the first game after the All-Star break that this isn't this isn't just like a oneoffice isn't like oh we got some guys resting this was a decision made after week plus off and they're like we're gonna give this kid Ron on a sense of all got minutes off the bench so they might just be having like a little bit of a youth movement um but I like Taylor Hendricks for this stretch on he's probably available in nearly every League he has it's a stash play I don't know if you're not really want to start him next week you kind of had him for a couple waiver wired dollars and hope you get them he plays four games in three of the final four weeks so this guy could be you could get this guy off waivers right now and he could be offering you double double production during the fantasy playoffs that's a  really high upside but there's also a really low floor I'm rolling with the Jazz like making this concerted decision to start him and rolling with him over the next six weeks I think you can get a lot of value there  yeah for for posterity you know you talk about a soft tank that the deadline they soft pulled the plug it's like halfway out of the socket but they they owe their picked it okay see ya I still think that you're right in the sense that I think they will just prioritize development like they I don't think they care that much about making the player or anything like that so I don't think I would consider it like a tank yeah I think they are going to throw hands out there who I mean per 306 you know his points numbers aren't that aren't that amazing or anything but it's 1.4 steals 1.2 blocks two threes so like if you're in a category League it's a 3D with some rebounds upside and that's that is great stuff so good suggestion there  my my final wave of wire suggestion  okay we just can't quit them TJ McConnell 9% roster off the Indiana Pacers I was actually shocked to see his roster rate the slow his role at the beginning of the year fluctuated a ton you know Halliburton was in and out them hard will blah blah blah Albert's office minutes limit now so why why am I suggesting TJ McConnell  he passed seven games off the bench from McConnell  10 points and 59% from the field 5.4 says 3.3 rebounds in a box steel in yes only 18 minutes but five assists a guy off the wire grabbing you five assists 100% worth streaming on a 12 team roster with the Patriots on a 4 game week and in 16 weeks he's probably just be straight up roster like for the rest of the season because he he could give you 20 assists in a week easily he's not a lot of guys in The Wire there give you 20 system of four game weeks so  I just think you should be you gotta look at him as a streamer and shallower league and just add them in a deeply absolutely the Pacers score so many points and have so many players in the rotation that you can't go wrong and he's he's just like a professional he's so efficient when he's out there he knows how to get to his spots I love the pickup um okay let's get to some final listening or questions excuse me before we close the show out Admiral definitely recognize Admiral listening to the show here thoughts on Michael Porter Jr is he a hold in 12 team category leagues or would you drop him for someone with multi-cat upside like keyonte George Tre Mann Paul Reed Etc so basically like would you drop a low ceiling guy you know for like a high ceiling guy that the risk versus reward play here  that's interesting I I love the Nuggets I think they're in great position to make her push for this number one seed I think Porter is going to be a big factor in that I'm not going down threes I don't know if you're like he hasn't really struggled obviously like you said he's a one trick pony he makes threes um I'm probably just rolling with Porter for now I do like Trey man and keyonte George Paul Reid obviously there's production that to be had while in beats out I I'm thinking I'm just rolling with Pottery here though  yeah I would definitely not drop in I don't think I would drop him for read I don't think I would drop him for keonte and even Trey man I think Trey man as the height maybe has the highest upside all these guys but at the same time I don't know what's going on with lamelo yeah I just don't know I think I think you know man's worth picking up and he could have a role in the Mellow comes back but hard to say I would keep that BJ uh Treyton wants to know  would you drop Gafford khris Middleton or Ahmed Thompson for a sar Thompson and this isn't a points League  I'll mention this for Gafford it's a decent enough news item he came off the bench in the first game after the All-Star break behind Derek Lively and played 17 minutes at 4 Points five rebounds just did not  play that well compared to his previous games so  does that I mean are you is that enough of a sample for you to be like you know what I don't know about Gafford  I don't think it's enough of a sample for me to like straight up drop him I think there's a lot of values there getting bored blocking shots and getting lobs from Luca and Kyrie  but I am hesitant  I this is a tough question man I I khris Middleton  is probably the one that I'm gonna be picking just because he literally hasn't like played consistent that 30 minute role this season so there's just a lot of risk there but this is this is tougher  you got to see how many more games does Washington have this week do they play again this weekend I would assume so I would like monitor that situation see what what gaffer does again if it's another situation like this I probably lean more towards gaffer because Middleton has the higher upside if he comes back soon but if Gafford gets 20 to 25 minutes and it's more of a time share with lively than I'm probably rolling with dropping Middleton  yeah I think I think broadly to answer this question I don't think I would feel like compelled dropping these guys for so far I don't think you have to I don't think this is like a league winning move that you're potentially making  Van Damme wants to know a sar Thompson Grant Williams for 10 team points lie we kind of talked about both of these guys  I think a sar probably has IR upside but then Isaiah Stewart's coming back it's just  I think this is a pick your poison yeah I was Thompson definitely has the higher upside it's just a matter of how many threes Grant Williams can make  who to drop to pick up Chris Paul he has Mike Conley I would assume move Tre Mann or Walker Kessler a  I don't  I don't think you have to drop any of these guys  for Chris Paul I don't know what kind of League you're in oh yeah see nine cat I'm looking for the nine Cat 10 team  I don't think you have to do it because Chris Paul basically all year was barely a top 100 player  and I don't think that's going to necessarily change when he comes back and all of these guys that you listed Conley to soon move Tre Mann Walker Kessler even though Kessler's are down a little bit they all can play at top 100 level yeah  um but but what do you think I mean do you think it's worth a risk for like outside on Chris Paul there's no way I'm dropping or Tremor right now those guys are super high upside plays and probably in your starting lineup on no matter what right now I think commonly and Chris Paul are pretty even so then Kessler falling all the rotation a little bit but like he said top 100 upside if he is playing 20 minutes of getting those blocks so definitely do not need to make this move at all if I had to pick one I would probably lean towards Kessler but then that gives you a lot of point guards I don't know how that helps your roster uh Matt wants to know would you trade Kyrie for towns had to head Yahoo points by the way I you know I I both of us play a lot of competitive leagues that trades don't necessarily happen a lot I would say I love so many of these trade questions in the chatter amazing like guys are doing Blockbusters left and right and in Las I'm not saying your league Matt is not is not like a high stakes seriously but I just I love that so many people are active in the trade market  and the high stakes it makes you like you don't want to be the guy to mess up and so I feel like that always like plays into it a little bit this trade is just amazing I feel like we could do an entire hour-long podcast on how it would affect each team um I'm probably rolling with Kyrie right now the master getting hot they added a bunch of other weapons one thing I would say about Dallas right now is you know Derek Jones Josh Green PJ Washington Lively effort all these guys they added so much depth that I don't necessarily think it helps any of those depth guys and it's only gonna help Luke and Kyrie think those two are gonna become more fish and the offense is going to be seamless during the stretch run and then it's just a matter of Jason Kidd will ruin it in the playoffs to me this is close enough for just to note a Kyrie averages on the whole season about I think three or four more fantasy points per game than town so it's pretty close  for me this is a wash like I I think it's just based on need like if if you if you're more if you're thinner at Center if you're thinner at guard do whatever side of the trade you know make sense for that that's that's all about that um  James wants to know should I drop cam Whitmore Jabari Walker or Jordan Goodwin to activate heart and Stein need to drop one  um first of all yes you should have to drop one of these guys it's activated which one you know whip more whitmore's kind of hot and cold I don't know what his role is gonna be when you know because Fred Van Vleet just came back he's mostly only a Points Guy Jabari Walker is like a category League guy who's like kind of showing some stuff and Jordan Goodwin's like a 10-day contract so which are you leading any particular way on this I'm probably going reverse order Goodwin would be my number one guy to drop Jabbar would be my number two and Whitmore be my number three um like you said Goodwin might not be on the team with a couple weeks Jabari Walker fell out of the starting lineup Silly Season could bring him back into like top 100 player with that maybe and  you know I can't wait more fun if you already are rostering him you might as well just roster for the stretch run because there's some there's some hope there for an insane breakout but that's a long shot  Ian wants to know is Bruce Brown a drop in 14 team 9 cat League's  probably I mean it's just all year it's just been like blah you know it's just he hasn't given us that much even with Toronto now he can't he can't score double-digit points and like three consecutive games some games will give you know Assist some games will give you four it's just I don't think it's gonna he's gonna have any sort of like breakout you know to end the year oh man absolutely I didn't realize this I'm looking at his box scores now all right so end of January to like the beginning of February in three games he totaled seven Steals and five blocks and a three-game stretch since then he has  four Steals and no blocks that's concerning for a guy that probably assumed he was gonna get traded to a contender um  yeah I'm probably dropping him he he just gave up yeah like this is a guy that should be averaging at least the steel per game that's that's a bad stretch I'm totally fine dropping him side note gradey dick might be getting more playing time down the stretch he hasn't really gotten an opportunity Raptors need as much 3-point shooting as they can get so yeah I'm probably dropping Bruce Brown  yeah and they triggered for abaji yeah so that's that's an option for them too and for some reason I still am holding on to hope for Gary Trent he hey he has a good game once in a while uh Jeffrey wants to know is Daemon Shopper stash at Brooklyn starts Silly Season yes Capital why yes I haven't they run sharp is one of the best per minute fantasy producers around  per minute he ranked 74th and 8 cat you know averages 1.3 fantasy points per minute which is a an elite number  is absolutely yes from me I totally agree I'm all in on Sharp It's Gonna Come eventually hopefully  completely dominant rebounder insane Perth 36 numbers yeah it's it's gonna be awesome all right looks like we have about three more questions here we'll hit those then and then dip out  views on Melton and aldama Melton's injury is concerning to me but he will play tonight Nick nurse said he'll play Friday  so that's good but it's a back it's some sort of like hair loss it's like a stress reaction or something from his back so  that always concerns me I think he should be rostered because I think there is a chance you'll play like you know what he was seeing it  29 minutes again and he was ranked 87th and eighth cat so I would say roster him  do you have any takes on aldama who  you know  aldama has this good games he has his bag games like wait do you want a roster him General thoughts um points League I'm I'm fine rostering Alma of category League there's the shooting isn't that efficient he's his assistant been pretty nice recently had a season High seven assists in his last game so that's that's a nice boost but he hasn't scored in double figures in three games shooting efficiency is a concern hasn't had double-digit rebounds since January 2nd I think Milton is more of a wait and see for me I'll dhamma is you're not gonna be getting anything more than what he's been doing so if right like he's Obama's pretty stagnant you know what you're getting and melting his way and see um okay uh lumon sorry if I mispronounced your name Lillard and Vince Williams or Fox Mobley 14 team 9 cat had to head I don't know if you're asking whether you want to start these guys or whether you want to whether this is a potential trade offer let me double check these let me double check for if it's for the upcoming week the books my games at the Bucks have here three games Grizzlies have four games  Kings have three games calves have four games so game counts essentially the same any strong thoughts on this whether it's like a start sick question or a if this was a trade question um yeah if this was a start sit question um  probably rolling with Fox and Mobley  trade I would be in be curious Fox is not a great free-throw shooter on I have him and our stake league and he's been a huge producer for me but the the free throws has been a major issue he missed his first two free throws last night and for a guy that goes to the free-throw line a lot that's not great Mobley has been better at the free-throw line I think Fox and Mobley is the higher upside I would just be worried about that that free throw percentage I think Lillard I just want to put it out I think literally is going to be just fine I don't know if they all star break is gonna like rejuvenate him or anything but I think lowered in the Box will be just fine  Lamont says is a trade question  I think I would rather be on the fox Mobly side I you're concerns about his free throw percentage foxes free throw percentage very legit  you know I and this like Vince Williams has been awesome and Lillard should he I think leather can only play better let's play that way yeah but I think just the floor is higher on Fox Mobley because I  just like who knows what Vince Williams like what if Bane and smart do come back yeah like I don't I don't know I think I would rather have foxy but it's I think it's closed because Vince has been really good for a long time it's a lot closer than it should be oh yeah um all right two more questions than we are officially are here trading away Triple J  and  who is RW you got this one for me kirian no I do not for siakam and keonte is this favorable you're gonna have to tell us  you're gonna have to tell us who are W is I'm sorry I can't I can't decipher this one robust Russell Westbrook Robert Williams  will be awesome  Royce O'Neill Russell Westbrook okay yeah he's gotta be rustler trading way uh Triple J and Russell Westbrook for siakam and keonte is this favorable  that's tough It's Grizzly's Silly Season could get underway but that's been Silly Season the entire season and  siakam like we said the patients are score a bunch of points he hasn't really like  like exploded yet but consistent production and I've already mentioned how much I like keyonte George super high upside guy on I would be willing to roll the dice if you feel compelled and make a move if you're sitting at the top of the standings and Jackson has been a baller for you you don't need to move off of them but I think that's my tip that's all I got yeah I I think I would lean siakam and keonte here I think we agree that Chianti should be rostered in like 12 teams almost all League's and I don't feel that way about Russell Westbrook and Triple J and siaka I think have similar trajectory or potential upside General fantasy value so I would I would lean see how come keonte  um  final question here I appreciate everyone who's asked us questions and it's been a fun pod James wants to know Royston O'Neill Worth to pick up in 1 4  I want to say yes but what do you think here and I mean he what  he's yes I'm absolutely rolling with them on okay nurkic got benched last night  Drew Eubanks is not factor most of the time the songs are gonna want to spread it out they're gonna want to shoot threes even if Bradley Beal comes back soon really soon he was gonna be seeing 25 to 30 minutes for game Off the Bench he's gonna get you some Steals and defensive production he is gonna hit you some threes I think he's definitely should probably be offered in a 14 Team league I would be happy to have him you know you're not gonna get crazy points production or anything but it's just gonna be solid production across the board that can help you in numerous categories so maybe if you're  only in search of like one need and he doesn't feel that one need then he might not be a move but if you're just looking for a salad plate to get production to replace an injured person I'm absolutely making this move  and this is actually our final question Drell coming in hot got the key we gotta give him the red light warning he came in hot so I'm gonna  he wants to know why Colin Sexton's minutes  are low relatively speaking Yeah I mean let's say let's just take over the in February in February he's averaging 27 minutes a game I still give me 21 points and five assists so I assume Jarrell oh you're like hey I have this guy my roster why can't he played 36 minutes and give me 28 points a game  I think it's just because it's a combination of  they want Sexton to buy in on both sides of the ball  and I don't think he has the energy on both sides of the ball to be like giving 35 minutes a game the way they wanted to so they're like well we'll just play him this he'll go all out and that'll be that I think that's totally fair  you would rather have 26 27 minutes of section that 100% as opposed to  20 minutes of them at 100% and 15 minutes of them at 80% he really relies on that energy to make an impact across the board so it is disappointing but it I feel like in the long run it's better for his efficiency  all right that will officially wrap it up for us thank you everybody for tuning in thank you for all the questions they
