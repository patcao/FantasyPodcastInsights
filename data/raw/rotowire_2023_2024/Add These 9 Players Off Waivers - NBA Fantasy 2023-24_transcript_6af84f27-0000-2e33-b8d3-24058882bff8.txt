go ahead Alex  Alex we're live we're on oh you can't hear anything well maybe we're not live  well welcome to the RotoWire podcast  it is November 3rd 2023 with a muted or deaf Alex bartha  Shannon McCune and I am Ken k train Crites  oh boy  we're gonna stick to our usual in season format of news fan feedback waiver wire DFS picks and some silliness not sure what Alex is doing  Alex what's your reduced our first news item I'm here I told you I was having audio issues but you started the podcast about asking so this can be an argument we have later like an old married couple I did you didn't answer you couldn't hear me we had Victor one banana I have a massive game against the sons with 38 points 10 rebounds two blocks and three triples up at 20 up 20 at the half the Spurs almost blew at the end Devin Booker was trying to win the game himself but the Spurs and one banana would on a 12-0 run late in The Fourth Kind of that came through women Jama  now shooting 79% of the fourth quarter Booker returned from his toe issue which is obviously a major news item he had been out for a while still kind of waiting on Bradley Beal not really sure what's going on there had a great 31 points nine rebounds 13 assists  Jeremy Sohan also thought about game Ken  yeah we'll get to that a little later but he's been up and down  but some injury news unfortunately right Alex yeah Devin vassell did not play in the second half due to a groin injury and Pops that he is likely out a while no idea what that means that could be like he's out three days I could be he's out three weeks Shannon do you think there's anybody to add with this news or is it just is it going to be too much like Doug McDermott taken usage away from other guys well random random got the start in the second half in place of a cell but it's really trade Jones who beats my interest the most Trey Jones you know he played 28 minutes of the bench unit for the Spurs he wed the the bench unit in minutes played offensive rating of 150 usage of 16.3 last night finished the game with 12 points 10 assists and one steal and that that's really why I love Trey Jones It's So steal or I'm sorry the cyst and that's the category where he can really step up he is the best FAQ  on that team you know you've got other players who have stepped up so high so Hand being the the you know point guard by default in the starting lineup had his best facilitating game of the season last night with nine assists but Trey Jones is still the guy who has the most upside in that category for the Spurs so I think he's probably the one who will end up being plugged into the starting lineup if the cell misses any any more time so that's the guy I'm picking up like that Philadelphia I like that I'll say in deeper League cedi Osman if trade Jones is a not available cedi Osman has scored in double digits for the last five games for the Spurs but yeah Jones is the guy yes in Philly a hardened list PJ tuckerless 76ers made quick work of Toronto 114 to 99 Kelly oubre got to start scored 23 on 8/13 shooting played 30 minutes also grab five boards he's averaging gentleman 20 points a game through four games maybe more impressive though shooting 50% from the field we know Uber has struggled with his efficiency guys is he the new starter at the three after this trade  I wouldn't I think it's possible I mean if I were them I would start coming from the defense and I think having Uber Off the Bench would be nice just because you know he has no conscience when he comes shooting the basketball but I'm not 100% sure what they'll do I think either way who break probably sees like 25 you know 28 minutes a game still yeah yeah I wouldn't be surprised if given the success that that starting lineup saw last night if they go and run it back and at least try to see if that works long term I agree with Alex though I think they probably prefer to have Uber a be that six-man score Off the Bench but it's hard to hard to argue with the results from last night and it's still going to take some time for the new additions to that roster to really you know mesh with the team figure out the rules and the rotation so we could see Uber at least in the short term sticking the starting lineup people are talking like oh Covington's back with a Sixers that should be easy but Nick nurses system I'm sure as wildly different than the crazy process they were running when Covington was with the Sixers a while back and that that's one thing about Nick nurse too is I feel like he really plugged in his best five players in the starting lineup when he was in Toronto and he didn't worry about you know you had seacom they would have smaller lineups where like siakam would be Center at times so Nick nurse might might not care just go with his best five  players which Uber is one of those certainly played a hot hand at least short term for now Alex take us to Utah  yeah you talk they fell the two and four with a home loss of Orlando Magic the Taylor Horton Tucker roller coaster which has been going up and down it was officially up 15 8 and 3 with 3 Steals and a block for him we finally had Pollo been Caroll have a bit of a Breakout game after struggling early in the season some low usage and bad shooting at 30 points and nine of 13 shooting nine boards five combined Steals and blocks we also had Walker Kessler finally have a big block game five swats but we only saw 25 minutes still has played more than 25 minutes only once the season they're still leaning a lot and Kelly Olynyk so that I mean can you I think in that game right  Four Points sorry yeah Kessler 4 points on six shots yeah I am getting worried about the usage I don't is it do they think he's a worse fit now the Collins has starting  uh yeah worried about the shots Clarkson is just gonna Jack unconscious he's going to take a ton of shots I worry about Kessler shot volume field goal attempts game to game this is get a little concerning yeah I think Shah volume was always going to be an issue with Kessler he's you know they're not they're not running set plays for him he's getting most of his most of his buckets off put backs you know easy dump offs where he's got a bunny so you know I'm not too concerned about that the minutes are the big issue for me 25 minutes last night and you know I I don't think it was properly assessed that the addition of John Collins means this team  can go smaller right you know marketing is already playing out of position as a small forward and they can slide those two up to the four and the five and go without a center and then of course the clinic Kelly Olynyk still still crushing it still providing value Off the Bench for this team so that gives them another big man who factors in you know it I believe Kesler still a whole no matter you know if you're in 12 team leads there might be some really shallows where you'd look elsewhere if you're fine with blocks but if you're in police that shallow you stop playing fantasy basketball anyways so I'm holding them because I still believe like this team it's not very good right now they're gonna probably sell some of their veterans Kessler is one of the long-term pieces if they if the season goes off the rails for the team they're going to keep him around and he'll get more minutes as the season where is on funny though we are complaining on a night when he got five blocks great great to see those slots  one last thing we want to hit before we jump into fan feedback and waiver wire herb Jones had a big game we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that he had 21 points on six of seven from the field and nine of nine from the free throw line five boards three assists four blocks and three Steals and 34 minutes again Shannon's Pistons all those Zion and Ingram were both out  so that is important  yeah a couple of bad bad losses for the Pistons in a row unfortunately Cade Cunningham you know the back-to-back games not a great showing for him his field goal percentage is a bit of a mess right now he was 8 for 22 last night the you know overall he's shooting 40.7% from the floor free throws great 86.4 and 3 point shot is actually much improved this season he's taking a career high six point eight attempts for game in 41 and a half percent turnovers another red flag here for Cade averaging 5.5 turnovers per game right now not great not great yeah but I you know I I you know this guy who has played 82 career games it's his third season but last night was his 82nd career game so he now has one full season under his belt as far as game volume goes so it's still very encouraging to see some of the the signs we have averaging 22.77 and a half assist and like I said three pointers he's knocking those down at a great clip so tons of upside but there may be some struggles for field goal percentage in turnovers specialty those nine category leads will be problematic  Alex tell us about our good

question on a chat to this whole live thing on to old for this but that is promotion code r w n b a  we're going to our fan feedback again  yes fans please ask us a question in the comments of this week's waiver wire video look for waiver wire on the cover of the video on the new RotoWire fantasy basketball YouTube page and we may answer it here on next week's show  so from fan Dylan twaddle  would you trade mark hell faults for Andrew Wiggins side note faults missed Thursday's game in Utah dude left knee soreness let's say you Shannon and Alex  I would rather have full I think he has more upside some of it depends on what your league settings are but  I mean and it's been a little low maybe because of the knee issues we can say hasn't been very good I would rather a false I like the wigan's side we're going to start off extremely slow he's averaging 11.4 points only 2.2 rebounds right now minutes have been low as well but I expect he'll bounce back you know it's they're still trying to get a handle on the Warriors still trying to get a handle on their rotation with Chris Paul involved Draymond Green's not now healthy but I do expect Wiggins is gonna bounce back see the 30-plus minutes that he's been accustomed to since joining the Warriors and I expect the production will follow  okay so we're split 50/50 there if I had to break the tie I think I lean a little more defaults just because I like the value of a cyst a little more  but I believe now it's time for our waiver wire picks heading into week three each of us are going to give two regular picks which means they're available players are available in 50% of the League's and one long shot where the players are available in 25% or fewer League's Alex start us off who is your first waiver wire recommendation here's Tim Hardaway Jr of the Dallas Mavericks roster about 37% of leaks they have four games next week the Mavericks do so that definitely helps coming off the bench for playing 29 minutes a game main thing is the shooting volume is really high and the percentages are sustainable some of this is Kyrie Irving's been out right so they need a little bit more of a playmaker got  to jump shots but  he's taking 15 shots a game nine of those are threes  45% from the field 43 percent from three that's not gonna come down a lot for for Tim Hardaway and with four games next week you just the shot volume is you have to take it  nice I like it you know Tim I feel like Tim hardaway's been a waiver wire discussion at least four times every season before games are clear he doesn't mind shooting you need three when he's on a hot hand if you need threes good way to go I'm gonna go in my first selection Malik monk of the Sacramento Kings he's rostered on 41% of leagues he scores yes but he also gets a decent amount of assists he's getting four and a half per game so far this season uh the Kings do have only three games next week forgot to point out by the way there are three teams with only two games next week that's Cleveland Portland and Toronto only have two games next week so be wary of that but back to monk Darren Fox is day-to-day with an ankle issue so they may not push his minutes next week monks also qualifies as a guard and forward on Yahoo and anyway over four games 14.3 points two boards four and a half assists  so you know if you need points if you need dimes monk is out there  good choice Ken my first waiver wire suggestion is the Deep Bay  Swingman for the Atlanta Hawks Bay lost his starting job to jail in Johnson a week ago  but guess he's snuck back into the starting lineup on November 1st base started against the Wizards played 32 minutes had 14 points 7 rebounds and two three-pointers I would expect that it's going to be the rules between Jalen Johnson and sneak they are going to be somewhat in flux you know add in DeAndre Hunter as well this team will probably there's gonna be nights where they sit a player so Johnson Bay both might be moving in and out starting lineup but even even Off the Bench Bay was still seen plenty of run 31 minutes 25 minutes in his two games off the bench this season overall averaging 11 and a half points five and a half rebounds 1.2 steals which is a career high if you can keep that up that's going to be solid production for you and 1.63 pointers the three-pointers should creep up he is a he's hit 2.5 and 2.6 is first two seasons in the NBA I believe he's the most 3-pointers ever for a player through the first two seasons of their career and he shooting a  higher clip from downtown this year 42% so far I mean if they increases if his efficiency and ends up being legit and he shows an improvement he's not going to be at the 50% clip he is right now but if he can shoot 456 per cent his fantasy value increases considerably and I think he's a lot to be a top 120 value well ideally get the play the Wizards every night that'd be all that would help that would help Alex who's your second pick yes Jalen Suggs out of Orlando this will be a pretty Orlando Centric thing moving forward from me but the Orlando is three games next week so pretty average but Suggs averaging 10 points five rebounds to assist obviously it doesn't sound very good but two Steals and 0.6 blocks and 25 minutes I think he had four steals last night I would not expect to shooting to get meaningfully better you just not a very good shooter they're trying them out with shooting guards seeing if it works I think that's steals are very sustainable we know he's a really good Defender he's I went check when I checked last night he was second in the NBA and deflections per game so that's that's a good sort of sticky Advanced staff for steals  and can pointing out on their document that whole Anthony is probably also an option for Orlando  once more of an offensive player averaging 16 points five rebounds three assists doesn't have the heels upside so it depends on what you need you know if you need the scoring punch at Anthony if you need some defense and stocks because they're both rostered about the same  yeah better percentage is from Anthony too but steals are hard to find uh with my second pick I'm gonna just repeat Bang the Drum again for someone we've always we've always liked the season Jeremy Sohan for your San Antonio Spurs surprisingly went back down to 51% roster I think he was dropped a lot after scoring 0 points in game two versus the Clippers again Spurs have four games next week as Alex pointed out Devin the cell is out with a groin issue we don't know how long that's gonna be more uses for Sohan pop is letting so Hand figure it out the point guard and in a nice bounce back game 14 points nine assists five rebounds on a block with maybe more importantly only one turnover last night in that win over the Suns so annoyed and Ford eligible on Yahoo so position flexibility as well  yeah I can't believe how many people drop them like I understand that maybe you know he's not he whether or not he's going to be a good point guard in the NBA very much to be determined but they're trying them out there and he's a very high IQ player and he's gonna get 30 minutes a game you know like you just got to be roster for 10 week especially on a four game week I would argue 10 Team league he is a fringe player depending on the depth of the rosters 12 team and above absolutely should be rostered and it would be it'd be great to have some more clarity on you know what these percentages you know we're targeting players who are under 50% roster on Yahoo 25% for our long shots but how many of those leagues consists of 18 or 10 teams we're not sure but I think so on  give me 12 team he's he's an easy addition I think he's kind of free On The Fringe there for for shallower formats now my my second pick up Denny Avia of the Washington Wizards 44% rostered he he is locked in to the starting lineup for starts for the Wizards only 23 and a half minutes for games so far but yeah when when most of the games are blowouts that's bound to happen I do think if the Wizards can be more competitive he'll see more run he had 40 fantasy points in the latest start against Atlanta which was a somewhat competitive game 22 points five rebounds 3 assists two steals one block two three-pointers that across the board category categorical contributions that's what Denny can do we need a nickname for Denny he's really I never want to have to say that last name again please but he I love the way he contribute across the board  44% roster seems way too low for his skill set and what he can provide for fans he roster I'm scooping up in any leaks where he's available 10 Team league he's kind of in that show honor range where he's more of probably a bench guy but I think he's worth a look because his production can increase as his minutes grow okay Alex it's time for your long shot and the re and the chat area is asking multiple questions about this Center situation in Orlando  or 14% oh  Wendell Carter Junior broke his finger his hand last night no current timetable you know some guys were covered by the others like sabonis broke is what is it his thumb last year and just kept playing but that was because it was his right thumb and he's the most left-handed player in the NBA so it may as well just chop the thing off but regardless I think Carter's probably gonna miss some time here we saw Wagner as a starter last year  for stretches and we've seen throughout his entire career because the minutes he can put up numbers so as a starter last year he was 14 points on go fishing sea 51 3486 was seven boards two assists and a steel not much of a shop blocker and that was in 26 minutes so I fully expect vagina to get the start here I don't know what they're going to do with the backup situation they have potasse there maybe they'll try more Jonathan Isaac at the five now that they have the opportunity but that's very that's very deeply stuff but to me Mohawk nurse is up we have them as a long shot but to me he's a he's a 12 team add if you if you  you know if you need the production or have someone that you can easily drop  it is it is Carter's offhand that's her correct  I believe so yeah I was just left hand so yeah it is a left hand fracture for Carter keep tabs on it but I agree I agree with that I mean Moe's the guy who's gonna get minutes at the five for the magic  all right my long shot could also be my dull pick of the week but it's starting forward Grant Williams for the Dallas Mavericks roster only 20% of the League's the Mavs have four games in week three Williams was a great streaming option last year when he was coming off the bench for Boston and now he's starting for Dallas getting more minutes so far early in the season he's averaging 31 and a half minutes per game and hey he drained seven triples on Wednesday he's averaging four three-pointers a game right now you know as you can imagine a lot of those are sweet set ups from Luca Williams the corner office is always open for Grant knows how to catch and shoot those threes also will get you should be getting better solid defensive stats than he's done so far for Dallas but I like Grant Williams as a streaming option this week Grant Williams was made  to be a streaming option on for game weeks he's locked into a starting role with the Dallas Mavericks he's going to get the minutes his production is going to be a roller coaster just like my long shot of the week Malik Beasley more of a categorical play if you need three-pointers he is the guy to pick up Beasley is locked into the starting lineup for the Box he's played 25 or more minutes started in each game started all four games  doing pretty solid right now averaging 12 points 3.3 rebounds two steals that that's the sweetener right there if he can keep up and averaged more than one steal per game that is value increases on likely since he's never done that in his career but still something to watch but from downtown 33 pointers per game fourth year in a row that he's been around that number he can hit threes that's what he does so if you need 3-pointers Beasley the only thing he's going to do for the bucks is stand in the corner and wait for the ball to get passed through him so we can Chuck up a three I love Beasley for that if you're in a week you're you're short on 3-pointers he's a guy to consider I think that's a good call I just wish the box for playing better so he could get more open looks and it would actually help but who knows I mean if you're in a deeply like you said you need threes he's a way to go  video editor  Alan this is lowkey suggested we mentioned some drops I think some obvious ones Isaac ororo for Cleveland they're getting healthy they only have two games next week I hope you still don't manage Matisse thigh ball in Portland they also only have two games plus five below doesn't do anything on offense and then precious to chew up for Toronto he's now hurt and they all in the Raptors only have two games any other drops how do you guys feel about Max cruises a possible drop  I'm I won't be a surprise I mean I think it's very I don't know likely is the right word it's likely that street is not really as well team guy in my opinion I mean I don't I don't know if he's upside is like really inside the top 100 I don't think I dropped him right now but like he has a pretty quick you know he doesn't if he kind of goes back to like heat Masters for the next two weeks I'm like I'm completely fine letting him go and streaming that spot or chasing upside elsewhere yeah I mean currently he's he's got about top 120 value for per game value at least you know the Big Boost there has been is increased rebounding numbers he has two big rebounding games this season 11 boards against Indy 12 boards against Brooklyn averaging seven per game right now the minutes are also a career high I mean he's averaging 37 minutes he averaged 28.4 of last year for Miami I actually think he's a hole in 12 team leads 10 teams you can cut them loose you can stream options there you know on a individual game that I'm a game by game basis there's gonna be a lot of up and downs with Spruce overall though I think he's locked into a significant role he'll see 30 plus minutes with the Cleveland Cavs all year is again be 37 minutes no is again average seven rebounds for game no but is he a 12 point two three-pointers per game two two and a half  three pointer per game guy yes so if your league values that he's still going to have solid value awesome  he's shooting right now he's actually kind of a cold Street he's shooting 34.8 for the season he's better shooter than that he should be above 40% being that 42 maybe 43 range once he gets the the stroke going so his value actually some some areas he's going to show Improvement  and that is the end of our waiver wire segments Alex tell us about our good friends at Vivid Seats  the

for our road to wire slash Sports contest for the Friday night slate very very easy format fun and I hope you guys join us all right 78 slate  highest over under  not much not much not a single game in the two 30s Al what are we going to do  I don't even know that's possible in the modern MBA it's really bizarre as always you know we could mention a million injuries here because there are always a million injuries in the NBA but we have a we have injury page on RotoWire so check that out for the updated information but we do have like you have to you have to monitor the Garland Allen situation in Cleveland halliburton's questionable Dinwiddie might come back and what is the  we do have well one one of the big injury news items that we already aware of is SGA  is sitting Friday night for the Thunder  who are you looking to plug into your DFS lineup with SGA out  I think this is just  I mean  it could be as simple as just more Jalen Williams more Josh Getty  Cason Wallace has been really interesting for them I could see him getting more minutes I don't know if he's high usage enough but to me this just makes me lean more on Jalen Williams and and Josh giddey I'm with you Williams was my initial plug-in as soon as I went to set my DFS online UPS on both DraftKings and fans of the night tonight Whalen will Jalen Williams was the first player I plugged in he still kind of that mid-priced range 6500 on DraftKings and 6700 on FanDuel giddy's more expensive I actually think he's a he's kind of prohibitive I can't go with him on DraftKings 8400 he's only averaged 28 fans he points per game this season I know he's been good with SGI SGA out in the past but this is a deeper Thunder team than we have last season you have chat homegrown who's going to step up and film more of that score role you have Jalen Williams who has you know it's just a great all-around player Wallace like you mentioned I mean I think Wallace will be interesting but he's expensive on DraftKings too 5400 for a guy who's really  unproven he's a bit cheaper Wallace is a bit cheaper on FanDuel 4200 I like him I like him in that range specially if he gets the starting nod but we don't know who's going to start over SGA right now it could be Wallace could be Trey man could be Isaiah Joe there they could go any which way and I wouldn't be surprised well and I'll mention on our RotoWire daily lineups page which everybody should visit we have a an on-off Court stat feature so when somebody's ruled out you can click on off course stats  and see where the usage goes unfortunately it doesn't provide any more information in this case than we are saying because with SJ off the court it's a five it's a 6% bump for giddy a 5% bump for Jalen Williams and a 5% bumper case and Wallace also an 11% bump for Isaiah Joe that's a little interesting if you want like a really low price flyer  but yeah I think I think everything you said Shannon is on point  some other options I'm looking at  how about we talked about trade Jones a little bit how about highest Jones he has been  yeah both ties Jones and pool we can talk about both wizard guards they've both been very disappointing this season  but on FanDuel in particular  I I find it hard to pull away from them I feel like eventually the Wizards are going to have a close game and these two guys are going to put together the night the type of performance that was projected from them during the preseason 6700 for pool and 6100 for Ty's Jones I will say that 60,700 for pool is for a guy who could go out there and score 50 fantasy points like we know we has that in him  it just seems that that that that's too appealing I can't move away from that  I don't blame you can Bullets jersey right now resident Jordan Poole fan right  happily switch to the Celtics bandwagon now that I'm living here in New England but in my youth I'm trying to remember who would be the Jordan Poole example  Kevin gravy used to jacket up some for them but he was more of a shooting guard he's pretty slow but now you know what kills me with pool throwing it off the backboard for a dunk when you're down 20 points how about you just make the layup get out your team's terrible wretched and you're he's wagging the tongue they're getting their ass kicked on a regular basis and he thinks he's like ready for the All-Star ballots ridiculous they're entertainers can just I can't for obvious reasons  um yeah I mean I agree with you Shannon that that um salary for Jordan Poole is ridiculous given that given the volume that he's shooting at and yeah it's highest Jones is stealing some of his assists because he I suppose runs the offense there I mean it's it's really hard to say he does wins like Jordan Poole is taking 25 shots a game who's offenses it really but yeah at some point like you mentioned  maybe it's not tonight against the Heap but if you keep putting them in your lineup at that at that salary it's gonna pay off Wendy's days  um Alex what is your confidence the Jimmy Butler plays tonight game time decision I know what you wrote on RotoWire and we know the heat in their injury labels are interesting  uh yeah I mean he's expected to play  but if there's one night to rest a guy it might be against the Wizards while you're at home so I would just let's just keep an eye on that you know and I mean even if he does play maybe his minutes are down yeah yeah he gets pulled early so that's that's the situation I would probably avoid I thought you were gonna ask me about the Box my confidence level in the Box going up against the Knicks and I will tell you that it is zero yeah I mean on the on we were you know Nick and I were talking on the XM show Serious XM NBA channel 86  listen that's a plug you guys are on 6:00 Eastern usually 70 Eastern 70 Eastern my apologies um  I liked the Raptors plus four the other night against the box I was like I'm not What's the why would I have confidence in this box team  and I don't know I mean I've seen I you might have to help me out Shannon I don't have the littler's salary in front of me because I'm I'm away from my normal setup and I got too many tabs open I can't click through but I saw Lillard's points prop up at 28 and a half the other day to me that's crazy he's not gonna average 29 Points a game for the bucks not even close so I still be worried a lot of these guys salaries are too high officially going up against a good defense like New York he is 8,900 on FanDuel which is actually you know that's probably about right this guy who routinely is a 10,000 dollar player on FanDuel so I think seeing them in that range is about right obviously you know he's had a couple down games but that season opener 57 points like we know he has that kind of upside and to get a guy who can score 60 fantasy points in a single game under 9,000 dollars is pretty  pretty rare he's at 9400 on DraftKings  yeah my concern for Lillard just continues to be like the shot at times 13 shots a game like  it's just I don't know it's not enough volume but I understand I mean if you got 8900 left over in your FanDuel lineup and Lillard is setting there it's pretty hard not to be like well tonight right didn't Giannis admit hey we're still figuring this out oh yeah yeah and that's that's going to be the case like keep building chemistry with teams like that that are just plugged together and don't have that much time I mean go and look at I always bring this up when this type of discussion comes up go look at the heat when they brought in the big three LeBron Dwyane Wade Chris Bosh they were 10 and 10 after 20 games a quarter of the way through the season there were 500 team they went to the finals that year they were fine they struggled it took a while to mesh even guys who were really good friends off the court already and it probably played together a lot International play and whatnot  you know it took time for them to mesh and I'm not surprised if the Bucks you know continue their slow start continues but they're going to figure it out I think Dame will he averaged 30 points per game this year no but is he going to be 26 27 points bunch of three-pointers bunch of assist will Giannis be the guy yes there they'll get it out and everything will be fine  are there any other Targets on this slate for you Shannon we actually have the Owen 5 Memphis Grizzlies going up against the two and three Portland Trail Blazers  Portland World beaters beat my pistons in Detroit don't you know don't forget about the Portland surprising surprising the world with that victory over the Detroit Pistons which now Simon's job yep Simons is out so sharp scoot Anderson to be determined he I know he left the most recent game with injury so he is ruled out already for Friday night's game as well sharp technically is a game time decision but he's considered probable so you have like Brogden might get into the starting lineup Jeremy Grant's gonna assume I have your role I should sharp look fantastic against the Pistons so you know I do like that Portland side is a bit more interesting the values for every player is a bit more yeah a bit more manageable when building a while up Sharon Jackson Desmond Bane both very expensive on FanDuel and DraftKings Zaire Williams you know starting  small forward for Memphis I've liked him but a lot of risk when it comes to DFS he is under 5000 but still at risk and then Xavier Tillman he up and down and part of that is then match up based I know against Utah the both both Tillman and Kessler the big men both had bad nights in that matchup on November 1st because  the Grizzlies went small so then Utah went small and neither played many minutes Timon only had 14 minutes I he also had three fouls in those 14 minutes  I'm not too worried about Tillman yet I'm not confident enough in him to play him in a DFS lineup tonight but we had some some folks in the chat asking about should we drop drop chillman  I don't think so in a 10 Team league possibly it all depends and How Deeply he is who's available in the waiver wire and ten team weeks he's probably a guy who's gonna be more of a streaming option and and it replaceable player in 1214 teams I can't I can't Envision a scenario in a 12 team League where I would drop Tillman right now  yeah we had I can Envision one scenario which is when Santee comes back yes how much playing time and uses will all get versus Tillman that'll be interesting to see I honestly I don't know I need to see what they decide but Sonic got a lot of starts last year went out of us was out he did yeah our 16 team stake League we had I don't know what what the we have Fab on the waiver wire I think the person who grabbed Talman might have done 90 of the 100 fought in the Tillman it was an aggressive week one I've never seen anything like that Jalen Johnson as well went for I put in like a dollar bid for Tillman and I was like sweating about it  since we brought it up it was former Amigo DJ trainer blowing 90% of his Fab money before opening night on save your Tillman and did I want to screenshot that 14 minute  oh for four night box score I did but DJ's on vacation so I didn't bother him well gentlemen thank you for that fabulous DFS advice Alex tell us about our good friends at rival fantasy
