hey everybody I'm Steve Alexander Dr a this is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast and award-winning podcast I might add  that's Rick Cameron  we're late it's 5:00  this is more in our wheelhouse though we're more like 5:00 guys then it's 11:00 a.m. BS that we do nonetheless  let's do this what is up everybody it is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast with the ogs Rick Camilla Steve Alexander the in season tournament is about to tip off here with the box and the Pacers doctor a so let's get into this man let's help these people make some money probably about I don't know 10 minutes until we tip off with all the Pomp and Circumstance we got bucks minus five and a half of Doc I've got the Bucks to win and I've got the Pacers to cover both teams are in the top five in Pace the Pacers are one the books are five both want to run play Uptown boat game um that's Advantage Indiana in my opinion with Boston was beating them it was because they had the game at their Temple both teams are in the bottom 10 for defense Indiana's 28th and defensive rating Milwaukee's 22nd the Pacers have a much better bench no Crowder no content for Milwaukee um the Bucks don't have a matchup for Tyreese Halliburton so I believe doc we're going to get a 1 2 7 the points because I think this is going to be a very very close game and so I'll take the points here how you doing here on bucks minus five and a half  I'm going Pacers  I'm a homer I got to do it  however has been so good man and this is where the Bucks Miss Drew holiday because Drew holiday would be a shutdown tie Halliburton guy  he's not there Damian Lillard is gonna be standing there watching Ty Halliburton run right past him or launching three threes over his head  and I feel like the Pacers they're undefeated in this thing they seem like a team of Destiny my bold prediction was the Pacers are going to win the east  at the beginning of season and people thought I was insane  they're pretty good man and I I'm kind of Blown Away by the fact that Rick Carlisle  is he's bought into this whole let's be fun let's be a fun team because Rick Carlyle is not normally a fun guy but he's like let's be fun let's give the fans something they can get behind and root for and let's just run as fast as we can and not give a damn about defense and just outscore the other guy so I think it comes down to do they have anybody  who can at least somewhat contain Giannis  if they somewhat contain Giannis and Malik Beasley  does not go crazy I think the paces went  um so I like your breakdown all of it I I just completed a I did a Pelicans in Lakers Underdog fantasy lineup and I just put one in here DOC for this game and so let's get this out we'll talk about a bunch of other fantasy stuff once the game is started here but I got Halliburton doc over 40 and a half points in assists so I'm taking the rebounds out he's been a good rebounder but I don't know I feel very good about the points in this here 40 and a half points in the assist for Halliburton I'm going over on that um and for a Bruce Brown your guy he's got a 21 prayer today doc which is points rebounds and assists and and then I've got Giannis at over 52 and a half pra points rebounds and assist I believe that that yanis and Halliburton are going to be phenomenal today again it's a defense optional game I think this is going to be a fantasy Feast there's to be fast play lots of shots lots of Miss shots lots of rebounds lots of Giannis coming downhill lots of Tyrese Halliburton with the Halliburton hop and by the way has anybody coined that or is that mine The Halliburton hop let's put that out here here on the roadwire fantasy basketball podcast but doc that's my Underdog fantasy three-pack parlay as I try to turn 10 into 60 here on Janice over 52 and a half Haley over 40 and a half p and a and then your boy Bruce Brown Bruce Brown shows up in big games if it's a Tuesday night at home against Detroit that's not the game to stream Bruce brown or hit him in DFS do you know this um going back to his Brooklyn days when it's and obviously last year at Denver when it's a big game Bruce Brown just like activates and it's like he's more caffeinated than usual and I think we're going to get one of those types of games tonight I kind of like to take um  yeah my Pacers Underdog 5 leg parlays  kind of boring it's This is Swing this is a swing for the fences  over one and a half steals for Tyrese over one and a half steals for Bruce Brown  over one and a half three pointers for brolo okay what tell me that one again Lopez would say what Bruce Brown is one and a half steals yeah  wow okay I'm not saying that to you I'm saying that to that number should be one that number shouldn't be one and a half all right well Lopez is what now  one and one and a half triples  what I love that I miss that one one and a half threes for Brooke Lopez in this yeah yeah I love that he'll get that first quarter dude I love that bet right what else um Myles Turner with the double double  he's got a big old  it's got a big old pepper next to it that's a hot pic and then Obi topping the guy let me down with no rebounds the second half last game I got him hired and 15 and a half points and rebounds and Rick  there's a new tool at RotoWire  to do this with and they they break down all of these bets it tells you how often they hit it tells you what road of wires  take on it is it's good stuff I use that to put this together I'm gonna let you talk for a minute and then I'm oh it's right here um  what is the link for that  it's it's  it roar.com I think you try it for free I'll put a link out to it on a Twitter when we're done because I don't know the actual  you know how to tell you to get there but it's  it's a  it's pretty sweet they do best  best prize picks picks you can do best underdogs you narrow down to whatever format you're playing in and it it's it's pretty cool and if I win then I'm going to be really all about it  um I love it dude I got Halliburton over one and a half steals Bruce Brown over one and a half steals Lopez over one and a half threes Turner a double-double and Obi top and over 15 and a half points and rebounds we'll get into a Pelicans Lakers later on in the show here but I want to do unpack that before the game tip which is very soon here um and Chow Chad TV says desperate tonight playing catch up who was more likely to get over eight minutes tonight Chris Livingston or Maxwell Lewis yeah it's that Grim Shout it ain't gonna happen for you leave them on waivers and keep it moving with your life and if you take it all this week you take an L this week like I'm I'm in a rears in a couple of my fantasy games this week because of Monday night and and I didn't have enough dudes and I maybe had three and the other guy had six and so it sets you back and you're playing ketchup all week I completely did it um but those aren't the guys I don't think Chris Livingston or Maxwell Lewis are going to get a single second in this basketball game possibly doc if it's a if they're 30 point below outs and there's garbage time in the fourth quarter but shout out I think it's up to Creek here did Chow Chad could ask Charles Barkley what sport those guys play and he may not get it right I mean  we're talking scraping bottom bottom of the barrel right there and I'm with you I view one of those guys get eight minutes it would be nothing short of a a Christmas miracle  coming early here on December 7th Rick kamla Steve Alexander acha doctor a we're the ogs and this is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast um so let's dive into some of this here doc a and we'll we got our eye on the game and it's about to tip off and so psyched about these n Season Tournament final four games tonight um let's start with this doc heading into this two-pack of final four games who is the MVP of the NCS internment heading into the semi-finals here I've got Tyreese Halliburton doc um it's the itest it's the stat test hoop site does a global rating for players and in it's a really cool metric and its efficiency and it's all the you know it's all the kind of stuff but um and they rank them it's not a fantasy ranking it's a reality ranking right but it's hoop side who pipes Global rating Hallie is first second you'll just third Dame is forth okay  and then LeBron is Fifth and I'll stop right there Halliburton is two of their Global rating points above Giannis which is a big gap um and so statistically he's kind of sort of laughing the field here and their five and oh and we have the win at Philly and we have the win at home against Boston so is there any doubt to you that Halliburton is the MVP of this tournament here so far so far he is I mean you can't argue with any of it they haven't lost the game the crowd the Indiana crowd  is literally in a fever over this thing and I'm sure there are watch parties going on in Indy  for this game but they got to win tonight for him to complete the  complete the the circle I guess  so I mean it comes down to who wins tonight I still am kind of feeling like Anthony Davis and the Lakers could end up taking this whole thing  but you know Davis is down there at number eight so LeBron's even in front of him so he's got some work to do he's gonna have the ball out today in Saturday if that's gonna happen but if the pace is win tonight and how Albert plays well again which is going to because they don't have anybody who can stop him  he's got a real good chance um the Lakers don't have anybody that can stop Halliburton either nor do the New Orleans Pelicans Steve mentioned it like Drew holiday yeah Drew holiday could take a piece out of Drew holiday all we just saw that game on Monday and Drew holiday had his way with even the great Drew holiday who was pathetic on the offensive end of that basketball game so Halliburton is in the lead right now guys for MVP of the n Season tournament look you're gonna have to win these next two games you we're not gonna have a jury West 1969 where you lose the finals to the Celtics and you get the finals MVP the only time that's ever happened and you know  doc okay and in America dang it we don't give Awards to run her up okay when the tournament and the best player on the team that wins the tournament will win the MVP of this tournament so how he's got two more to go  all right I will say go ahead  Halliburton  the numbers he's put up so far I can see them losing in the finals  and him winning MVP  yeah I I love you like a bro but I think you're nuts his numbers right now are 28 in the tournament 28 points five rebounds 13 assists and very high efficiency I mean I  I don't know that triple double is first ever triple double came at the right time I don't know I could see it happening and also I think New Orleans does have a possible Thai Halliburton stopper in Herbie Jones  her Jones's I  he's the potential Halliburton stopper if they get that far but like I said like her Jones is a stud uh Halliburton just cooked through holiday like I he's almost just an Unstoppable Supernova of the player right now and they're about to tip this thing off on let's see what no this one's Ese and they're putting all the announcers together from Turner and ESPN and but the late night game tonight will be on on TNT but it is Cam it is Doc we are the ogs and this is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast um doc I want to get you into Desmond beIN here we have some Sensational performance as last night I look at the Luca 29 Point first half triple double and I'm like all right cool it was against the Jazz he lost by 50 the Jazz they're more of a dumpster fire than Detroit or Memphis right now they're just not even competing at all and then you want to be with the 50 but Baine had 40 nine okay a career high six board seven assists on the only Grizzly to hit those numbers ever on the season he's going 25/5 and 5 his shooting splits are down from what we know them usually to be but that's all right we get it you don't have your point guard short-handed 47 38 and 86 though he's still flirting with 5490 bringing you defense he's got two point two combined stocks and and it's just been absolutely terrific but doc I believe with John Morant coming back they played 20 games five more suspension games to go and then and then job will be back and we're going to see Bane's numbers come down from 25/5 and 5 um and the efficiencies she's going to go up but he's not going to score 25 points per game so where you out with this I would investigate trading Desmond Bane right now now um and looking maybe I could parlay him in another dude into a really big boy um and just make a run at Halliburton or something see what your league says Desmond Bane's numbers are fantastic right now very sellable and so I'm not saying give them away but doc I would shop Desmond beIN here because once we get a week out Doc and it's like John Moritz coming back and headlines start to pop and you know videos start to surface and working out and all this kind of stuff I think your opportunities going to be over at that point but we're here five games out about a week and a half out of I think Now's the Time to pounds if you want to try to sell how I would Desmond Bane where you at with that  you know it's interesting also I'm losing my voice here so just bear with me um  the whole reason I was so high on Desmond Bane was the 251 NBC kind of ripped me when I drafted Desmond Bane and second round and one of our drafts but he was totally worth it he's the top 20 guy right now um I don't think he's gonna drop very far when John comes back he's gonna take a little bit of a hit but he should also have more open looks John's gonna be dominating the ball but Bane has been good with jaw in the past so I'm I still think Bane's gonna be a big part of what they do I think things are going to be easier for him the numbers might come down a little bit but the efficiency might go up I'm not like Panic Trading  Desmond Bane right now but I'm okay with looking into moving him for for you need a stud you need a top 20 guy coming back though to do it  um yeah there's no doubt about that it's got to be it's got to be a heavyweight coming back for Desmond Bane Rollo for three  yeah he did he just said a three hey a quick before we move on to our next bit here um I don't know if you were watching at the point where they were showing Rick Carlisle addressing his team before the game and behind Rick Carlisle we're all kinds of Myles Turner just put Giannis in the rim up there were a bunch of Jimmy John's sandwiches behind Rick Carlisle okay  that makes me like the Pacers plus five and a half even more today they're they're they're they're they're they're powered and high octane with the greatest sub sandwich there is Jimmy John's so doc let's have a quick sub debate here are you are you a Jimmy John's guy are you a firehouse guy like which one of you dig in the most I'm down with both  I mean I like all of them too Jersey Mike's but if you had a preference of one which one you going with well I was initially a firehouse guy  but I've come to love the cold sub  and bread combination of Jimmy John's  I mean that turkey Tom is money bro  I'll tear up some of that turkey time you I love it I'm a JJ Gargantuan guy I go I go for the Gusto Jimmy John's man I'm Turkey Tom all the way hey what we're talking about companies and selling sandwiches stop Underdog for said we've all we already have but Underdog

got other platforms that I can do a daily fantasy betting on okay but I'm Underdog fantasy is where I'm doing it right now and I'm enjoying the heck out of it um all right doc so the n Season tournament going on here Milwaukee with the 13 to 10 lead over the Indiana Pacers very early in this game I want to have a Golden State Warriors conversation with you here we saw kaminga get completely yo-yoed by Steve Kerr last night all right and coming is not a big fantasy guy but I just follow me here I want to take us down to me  he should be he would be somewhere else good point good point doc you got me there I mean obviously it's Kerr and he doesn't like young players and doesn't trust them blah blah blah that's why wiseman's in Detroit that's why pool is in Washington good point by you bro so uh so obviously come and go was the story of the game didn't play in the first half and then he had 13 points on perfect shooting in the second half okay he was the difference in the game  but Steve Kerr after the game talked about you know night tonight we're going to have different rotations and things are going to look different and  Steve Kerr is one of the most stubborn coaches  so to have him talk about different optionality night tonight speaks of how awful this basketball team is and how desperate he is guys that was a losing effort last night against Portland I don't know if you all stayed up late to watch that game The Warriors won okay but they should not have and you won by four over the Portland Trail Blazers who lost Brogden in the game they got Simon's back and they didn't have Grant or eight okay that should have been a 15-point beat down by the Golden State Warriors but it wasn't so I wonder doc if if Klay Thompson and Andrew Wiggins um are unnoticed as well now okay obviously coming get has been the yo-yo guy for her I get that and he's relied on Wiggins and Clay won championships with Clay one with wig I get all of that man but  then it's a bigger conversation right about our clay and Wiggins the two biggest fantasy disappointments this year because their numbers Steve are God awful there are atrocious all right so I if if you're gonna yank around Jonathan comingo who's 11 points in 19 minutes and actually been pretty solid for your team in a limited role Klay Thompson's been garbage Wiggins and spend even more garbage than Klay Thompson why are we yanking these guys in and out of the starting lineup for his for his teacher's pet a poem your boy poem yeah I don't know I'm encouraged just sticking with this guys  and these guys are Wiggins and Clay I mean clay looks washed up dude  I mean he looks washed right now is he gonna look washed  by the time Christmas gets here  hopefully not I mean I root for clay I want clay to do well but so far man he's he's not he doesn't look confident shooting the ball  he doesn't look right shooting the ball and  you know you want clay to feel good about his shot even if even even if it doesn't go in you want him to miss six in a row and it still shoot it  with that confidence he does not look like that right now so  I don't know man I I hope he's not washed but he is not look right and Wiggins  my goodness  put him over there and watching him with tyus Jones and Jordan Poole and just busy there's no doubt about it dude there is no doubt about it ah so let me give you Klay Thompson's numbers here man listen and I agree with you I'm a Klay Thompson guy I like Klay Thompson I think he's got I don't know him um but I like his style I like I like not like what he wears I just kind of like the way he talks and he's a deep thinker and um I don't know I just to play guy and we've seen him win and all this kind of stuff 15 and a half points I thought he was gonna be about 23 or 24 doc 30 9.7% from the field oh you gotta be kidding me dude 35% on threes okay in this is over 30 minutes a game it's brutal it's brutal and let me let me sing you song here about Andrew Wiggins okay you mentioned the K Train Truck it can cracks um he's in the cam Dynasty the dynasty League 14 team or head-to-head that I commissioned Stevens in this league as well shout out to K trained me and him and Darren Wilson who's a media guy in Minneapolis a great media guy in Minneapolis are all sort of right up there for first place we're about one game away from each other and so you know we're in this to win this man and Ken won it last year okay so we give him those flowers um K train tried to shop Andrew Wiggins and then dropped Andrew Wiggins okay and then I picked up Andrew Wiggins when he was hurt had this little finger thing right kept him in the the little IR spot for a minute on fan tracks and and and and left him there through last night because I'm like this guy this guy ain't it DOC I just dropped Andrew Wiggins to pick up rui hachimura and stream him because of the limited game factor with the NCAA tournament in only two games I just  dropped in a 14 team Dynasty League doc that's how bad it's gotten for Andrew Wiggins man  that says it all I mean it's bad  and curve is sticking with him thinking thin even when cuminga goes off and does what he supposed to do I I Kurt's gonna have to he's going to take a cherry pill  you know it's hard to suck it down but you're gonna have to make a decision  I I would be playing commission what is it I and I think we've gotten to that point docum with you again it's not working you're still you're you're below the player tournament right now if you're the Warriors I think desperate times call for desperate measures what a sheddy pill I thought you were playing the Chet homegrown car no Cherry Austin  last year I see or two years ago  Matt Stroud and I were doing a podcast he says something like Cherry Austin man he's just he's just  so hard to trust and I'm like man that sheddy pill is a tough one to swallow but sometimes you just have to suck it down  and sometimes you just need to throw sheddy in your lineup  see what happens but he's a tough pill to swallow and that's where we are with like her suck it up  put coming in there let him play  I mean  Jake shake up the rotation give your guys some life put him in there let him do his thing Andrew Wiggins does not deserve to start for this basketball team I mean it I believe he's at like point six stocks  you can look it up yeah it's like it's like 0.2 blocks point four steals it's like what that's like RJ Barrett bad that's like Allan Houston bad yeah Allan Houston Allan Houston was was he even an overrated well anyway was even a rated fantasy guy I know you know hit hit buckets and hit threes and all that but man he was a true category guy points threes and gave you nothing else shout out to the great Alan Houston so doc we have a comment here from let me pull this up here Admiral Meetup says sell high on Kobe white was Zach LaVine out another two to four weeks or is Colby a hold with a trade looming and he says 12 tap what is the team mean their doc teams  oh 12 teams my bad  um I thought it was some kind of anyway it doesn't matter um  I'm not selling out with Kobe white doc I'm not selling high with Kobe white I want to see first of all the next month or so he should be I don't know about a rock star but he should be very part of me very solid over the next month with Zach LaVine out before they traded Zach LaVine I believe Zach lavine's played his last game with the Chicago Bulls guys I think this is um the soft launch of that they're not coming out and saying it but shirani is saying that he'll be out the next three to four weeks guess what that butts up to January 15 when all the free agents signed in the offseason can then be traded during that next season so Levine's played his last game with the bulls man but I'm Holding On Toby white dot how about you he's inefficient I don't love everything he does but he has  one really good game per week yes two decent games a week and then he has one where it's kind of like oh man he just killed me you ain't lie and roller coaster ride it is but the highs are better than the lows and I I'm down with Kobe white I think Zach Levine is done in Chicago I'm with you there I don't even know if he's really hurt  honestly he just doesn't he's not happy they're they're not happy with him I think that relationship is broken and I think it's Kobe White's year to do whatever he wants to do so I'm hanging in there with Kobe um they just they just paid Kobe too um I see the Manning's up here and some kind of betting add are you tired of the Mannings  nah you're not tired of the Mannings know they have not reached the point of overexposure for you right now  pay they're Overexposed but I still I mean my pay dude I had season tickets in the Peyton Heyday in Indianapolis not talking about God I'm talking when when Peyton left when he was done in the Colts have never been the same it's hard for me to get excited about the Colts  I missed Payton so anytime I see bait and I'm down understood do you feel like are you tired of seeing Travis Kelce on TV oh my God yes  makes me want I want the Chiefs to lose every game  I don't need  to hear about  hey Mansion I don't need here about Kelsey or his Mansion I don't need to see Kelsey's tweets from when he was in high school I couldn't write in English sentence and Dion too man Dion you know this is why we can't have anything nice in America something cool happens and then we blow it up  and run it into the ground I mean I don't need to hear Dion's name again this year I don't need to hear Kelce  I don't care about the errors tour I don't care about any of it  oh my God I'm so glad I went there that was extraordinary it was  yeah absolutely extraordinary I got a question for you my Disco Biscuits are going on tour soon a little winter into into spring and summer tour so she got that going on anyway go ahead  you have been throwing the words stocks around a lot  are you mad at me deals and blocks combined not a fan of stocks  um I'm a man of the fantasy gold that yes I'm not a fan of the word I don't use it I don't write it I don't say it  I it makes me cringe a little bit like when I see Taylor Swift at a  God blessed Chiefs game  okay and you can't use it  I'm just saying it's not my jam  um it's look it it's I don't really say a lot but it's easy but when but when you you know so I would look I was almost dead on with Andrew Wiggins I said it was about 0.6 stocks right he's point seven point three blocks for Andrew Wiggins he's a one-one guys usually I was wrong one block one steal oh that's that's been terrible man absolutely terrible all right doc let's let's fire up some of the chat comments right here um ciao Chad I had a legitimate question that we can actually sink our teeth into as a supposed to and Shout we're messing with you here the Livingston Maxwell Lewis and Maxwell freaking Louis I forgot he was even on the Lakers but Xiao Chad says uh whereas his note here do you think this fix is JJ yeah yes JJJ needs John ramp back in the worst way we were talking about Kelsey being Overexposed and the man I think the Mannings are Overexposed I love them but they're over exposed right I mean they are you know don't hate on Eli don't  sleep on that resume or right Eli is top 10 QB all time man um but anyway um I think John Moran coming back is going to fix Jaron Jackson Jr he's like for Bain right he's a shot Hunter and he's a ball handler and he can play make a little bit so okay no job that just means more of me but Jared Jackson Jr is not he was not put on Earth to be a go-to guy to be a dump it down into the hole and have him pivot and make post moves um obviously it can't be a staple of your offense JJJ launching three is I mean he's good at it but it can't be a staple of your offense so I believe John's return will fix Jaron Jackson Jr tells you think about that  no I agree I think it's gonna help I think it's gonna make his life easier John JJ's big problem has been a lack of blocks and really bad shooting and when I was on the court Desmond Maine is going to be opening JJ's going to be open I do think it's going to help Jaren Jackson Jr a lot but having said that Jaron Jackson Jr is also helping himself right now his last two games 37 points and nine boards with a steel and a block two stocks uh 13 and 21 shooting and then he hit 10 and 20 against Detroit that was a must win game for Memphis they treated it like so they won the game he had 24 points 3 blocks for rebounds shot it well that's two games in a row  where he's looked better than he's looked all seasons so I think jjj's already turned the corner and when you throw John Moran back into that mix I think he's gonna take off  um I like the answer there a lot man so let's go to another comment here and his name is Paul yesung um he says should I trade marking in kuzma and Melton for out of bio and Tatum and the question at the end is really the key question is this a fair trade that wouldn't get vetoed ah I would veto this straight  no way  no way Melton to me is Is On The Fringe man it's like if this was three dudes like marking and kuzma and then another guy like that and you're you're kind of bundling a three-pack to go get a two-pack I get it but this is not a three-pack this is a two and a half pack um now look Paul what I would do is offer the trade okay and if they accept the trade and they accept the trade and then if there's backlash in the league and they try to undo the trade well then they do okay and you got to deal with that but you'll never know until you do it and I would happily turn Lowry Marketing in Calcutta the shutdown guys wait for it both of those guys will be shut down in late March and maybe even early March okay both of them I promise will be shut down and in Melton come on man its a no brainer know the the non-noble  if you're if you're saving enough of a fantasy manager  and you worked the the deal hard enough that you can pull that off and get out of bio and Tatum for those guys though shut down guys plus melting you do it all day and let's say you spend a week working on getting that deal done you finally talk to Guy into it the props to you man I think you should be rewarded for that not not penalized so I hate trade vetoes they make me really angry because the reality is you don't know who wins the trade until after the season you just don't know and who's to say one of those studs isn't gonna get hurt  who's to say mark and it doesn't play the whole season  you know you don't know what's going to happen so if you work your butt off and make a great trade for your team  I hate when those get vetoed and and it sends back by and bad blood through the league you get mad at your boys they get mad at you and it just calls us drama and the last thing any of us want out of our fantasy league is drama  Oh I bet a tumultuous relationship with League guy invented and created and I'm not in right now um and I'm not out of it now because the drama um it's it's a really really pricey league and I just I don't have the stomach before you still in League freak doc  no it's just it's like somebody else took over and became the commissioner and they ramped up the entry fee it's like way into the hundred so I'm like I'm good I'm good on that um and that's really that's a league for people who have real jobs and don't just talk about sports all day uh somewhere in there you might be right about that doc somewhere in there all right let's tell the people here the Bucks are of 29 to 23 over the Pacers here late in the first quarter McConnell missed a shot with the rebound of portice all right let's uh let's look ahead to Lakers and Pelicans here a little bit man um did you do a doc a underdog fantasy lineup for the Lakers and Pelicans tonight and if not I can I can get us going here you know yeah I did I did like 10 of them of course oh my God I love it I'm gonna do more than than what I have right here and I may add these and then um because the three that I got doc I really like and I might um like enlarge this and have just the three pack one and then make it like a six or seven and really try to I don't know have some fun with it but talk to me bro  bro update he's already hit two three-pointers man  gosh when you said that I missed that man I I did I was scrolling through I don't know I you know sometimes you just miss it I missed that one man I would have definitely added that to my on Pacers and bucks  parlay here that was a really good call by you man um any any other updates from the box score like to drop on us well Ty Halliburton it looks like a Monster again like he's he's getting what he wants and it's a close game end of the first quarter it's going to be fun all right let's talk about these what give me your Underdog give me one of your Underdog Lakers  okay first of all Zion Williamson  um doc did you look at Zion Williamson's points number on Underdog fantasy  did you do you happen to know what it is off the top of your head 22 and a half 22 and a half  that's sound that's does that sound a little low to you  it sounds a little low to me I love Zion over 22 and a half points tonight um CGM McCallum 17 and a half points and here's why I like CJ a bucks up 2927 end of one part me one second here die  um here's why I like CJ it's 17 and a half  CJ's arise to the occasion Guy this is a rise to the occasion game but I'm burying the lead here I believe Brandon Ingram's gonna have a tough game tonight doc we saw Devin Booker struggle against all of the waves of Laker Defenders with Vanderbilt and reddish and prints and all these guys are healthy right now the Vanderbilts probably going to play a little bit more than he played in the previous game which was I believe 16 minutes he may be up to a 20 minute threshold here in this game maybe more but I feel like there and because CJ has always kind of that third guy I was kind of that forgotten guy right Zion bi Zion bi you know they're the duo and all this kind of stuff and their CJ with DeAngelo Russell Austin Reeves come on man he's gonna Scorch these guys and they're terrific offensive players too but they're not gonna stop CJ McCollum so I think the Lakers are going to put a blanket on bi and and CJ is going to have to score well more than 17 and a half of they want to win this game so over on Zion at 22 and a half over on CJ at 17 and a half and over on LeBron at 28 points and you know it's a big number it's a step out it's not even close to his regular season average but  these are the games that he lives for he's been talking about how much this cup means to him and how much he wants to win it and he's gonna go for it and the Pelicans don't have anybody that can stop LeBron James man they do not so I think it's going to be a really fun  offensive minded game I believe not like super crazy high scoring but I think the guys are going to get their numbers in the right spot so Zion CJ in Braun with their points I'm going over Doc and trying to get a three like parlay here I like it I like it I've got a five gamer this is based on the RotoWire  Optimizer tool I told you all about which you can find if you go to RotoWire and dig around um I wish I had the link but I don't I got herb Jones  over four rebounds  that seems reasonable right  Trey Murphy 3-point specialist slash dunk contest  competitor  the two and a half three pointers  he's gonna get tons of minutes man Murphy's look great since he's come back he's gonna hit three triples I got LeBron like you do I got him oh actually I don't  I got LeBron under  43 and a half points rebounds of the sis  why you hating bro  I need to me add now that's what roadwire told me to do dog  I got Jonas found us higher than 23 and just quickly you know you know why I wrote a wire is doing that because the numbers are so far above his regular season averages III totally get with the system is doing right there man I get it I get it um but you know what I mean I'm like I just got a Vibe on LeBron tonight you know what I mean like I got a gut that he's gonna have a big one tonight but that I understand why he's why the the optimizer was telling you to go under because these numbers are well above as regular season averages so the computer is probably like does not compute like where are these numbers coming from right and so I'm boosting in um you know the motivation factor with a one and done final four or Vegas in season tournament right I think all that stuff matters for this game  yeah I think you're right  and I think with its here to me add or LeBron one of them's gonna go off we just don't know which one and we're in a similar situation was on Zions either going to get 10 rebounds or he's gonna get 30 30 points he's not gonna get 30 in 10  he's going to get 15 and 10  15 points 10 boards or he's gonna get 27 points and five boards Charles Barkley's like  we need him like Zion needs to crash the boards and score really but I he hasn't been doing both at the same time so you got to kind of pick one or the other and I I've been going with rebounds and stuff points for Zion uh and then the other guy I got in there is Austin Reeves I think he's gonna have a good game tonight higher than 18 and a half points and rebounds combined  I like the reefs call I do I his number was at 14 and a half I believe oh he's he's a guy that for points he's a guy that I that I may be adding to a bigger parlay later on so it is Rick Campbell it is Steve Alexander acha doctor a and wrapping up here the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast um doc let's talk a point spread here on Lakers and Pelicans  it's one and a half  um I would think that the Lakers would be favored by a little bit more than this but it's one and a half so Vegas in the way the money is coming in tells you that this is going to be a very very close game I thought  the points Fred on Milwaukee Indiana was too much you did as well we both tried to live inside that number or just get a win we took the five and a half with the Pacers I'm gonna lay the one and a half here with the Los Angeles Lakers doc I like them to win um I like them to win the tournament at this point and I think it'll be Lakers and bucks in the championship game on Saturday but I do like Lakers minus one and a half uh doc I do um the Lakers really don't have a good matchup for Zion Williamson that's kind of a hiccup for me but I do overall like to do of LeBron and Davis more than Zion in Ingram and it's not just liking them it's trusting them who's better who who's more explosive and all that kind of like LeBron's not explosive like anatomically he is but statistically he's not he doesn't go off for 40 points he doesn't put up triple doubles he basically 25 7 and 5 every night you just kind of always is around those numbers on BI is not really explosive he doesn't go massive in these games and the Lakers are healthy Doc and they got their dudes they got Vandal back who's going to be very effective defensively in his minutes so I got the Lakers minus one and a half doc how about you  I do too um I I think I think the reason the numbers so close is because now that the Pelicans all right Full Steam full force  CJ McCollum is back he's been incredible fantasy player this year like second round value Trey Murphy looks awesome herb Jones looks awesome Jonas found units playing well bi he's been healthy for once Zions been healthy for once I mean New Orleans is suddenly  the deepest team in this tournament probably right and then you got the Lakers where you got they're starting lineup and then nothing else like their bench is kind of garbage so it's depth versus  starters and I do give the the nod by a little bit to LeBron and AD and Austin Reeves at the Angelo Russell but  if it comes down to foul trouble and he comes down to a tight game and he comes down to guys being winded  I think New Orleans has a little bit of an edge so I think it's gonna be a great game the late game tonight is gonna be awesome and I'm gonna go with the Lakers just because I picked them to win the tournament they've got ad is my MVP so for him to win that they need to win he needs to go off but  yeah I I like Lakers might want to have all right doc let's answer a couple more questions here and do this one I got one oh you got it again  but when I was gonna do but let's uh let's go ahead and do it here all right doc tell him tell my man here Andre Sasson about Santi aldama is he a long-term player is he I don't know I kind of feel like he is  kind of feel like he is I think Xavier Tillman  has run its course right I just call Xavier tommen and it and said of a hymn that's my bad but no I I feel like savior Tillman is not the answer Steven Adams gone bye-bye won't see him all year Cynthia Oklahoma is kind of been doing stuff  he looks good I don't have his numbers pulled up in front of me but I like Obama I think he is a guy you want on your roster right now and and you know he's one of those guys and fantasy where you just ride him till the wheels fall off  yeah I'm not Auntie all dumb guy I mean I like him as a bench player you know he could be a backup for or five in the NBA if I were in a GM of an MBA team starting that's a hell no um that is if I want to win um you're not gonna win with all dumb and you're starting lineup longterm is he a good fantasy player now I don't think so I think he's a streamer or like doc said a pickup off the waiver wire and run them until he runs out of gas and put him back on waivers he's at 13 points six rebounds two assists one and a half stocks I say that because I know what A noise doc 0.8 steals point seven blocks he is at one point seven threes but the shooting has not been good it's dipped a lot why more minutes more defensive attention all that obvious stuff  um when the guys get healthy and atoms of course will not but Adams is under contract Beyond this year okay so that's going to be a block for aldama moving forward Brandon Clark looms is a block for all dhamma moving forward so I would write him until you know fortifications come back in the Cavalry comes home and heck maybe you can ride him for the through this year if 136 into with under one and one in the D and almost two threes if that works for you somehow someway cool knock yourself out but I don't I think next year when the Memphis Grizzlies are whole santel will be a 17 to 20 minute bench player next year yes he struggled shooting his last two games before that he went on a four-game run with double-figure scoring before that he had a he scored a bunch of points he's been kind of bad the last two games but in his last four games  he has at least a block and a steel in four straight  those are stocks bro he also hit a three-pointer in four straight  he's also got a 12 rebound game seven rebound game I I think sunny out is fine right now and I think the shooting slump  is going to end because he's in a two-game he's in a two game slump but I've been I enjoyed what santel dama has done so far he's been solid we had a turnover here by the Bucks Run out by the Pacers nice ones up or not some selfish shovel pass for tjm account to mathurin for the blast and a 4-point lead for the Pacers um really fun game man all right one more here let's pull up um let me go to this one right here last question of the day uh layout Toth or Lal Toth says who can I possibly offer for herb Jones either one for one or package one of these players and he's got giddy John Collins Kelly oubre Chris Paul and continuous called well Pope um and he  picked any two  really you're throwing giddy down into that mix where you're just you're just giving away getting like that he's been bad  I understand I do we are a quarter of the way through the season we don't  we don't see this turning around I Doc is pretty firm on that answer right there  I would try to package I mean the other thing let's not go crazy about herb Jones I mean like he is a good fantasy player is he a great fantasy player I tell you what doc he's great at one particular category and you know what category that is the stock category um I love rankling you at that right now but um our guy who categories by the way are yeah it is it is uh look at you look herb Jones is a 12 points four rebounds three assists okay 12 4 and 3 that's waiver wire stuff 1.3 blocks 1.1 steals 3.1 stocks that is Elite and he said 1.33 which is waiver wire material so let's not go crazy on herb Jones Okay Jones is it rated as a top 30 player right now  that's cool that's cool that's what the metrics can say I know the Rick Campbell algorithm that has been so successful for literally like two generations and and I mean it's about where are you making a difference statistically okay where is Herb Joe I understand the ranking and I appreciated and all that stuff okay herb is at 52% from the field but to me that's a little overrated when you when you accumulate the whole thing he's taking eight shots per game okay so that's not really I mean cool you're getting great efficiency on eight shots okay I want great efficiency on 16 or 20 shots um you know it's 36% on threes 88% from the line but again we're taking three free throws per game so okay he's 88 from the line but it's three free throws a game what is that really the it's so it's where you make a difference okay like a big man like Joel and bead was six assists right okay or um you know Valentino's with not balanced you know so bonus with his assist where are you making a difference where you cutting through the Clutter you know Luca with the rebounds and you know so a guard that rebounds a big that died um that's what I'm looking for dude I'm and look I got her on a couple of teams um frankly if some hot comes down the track I'm probably gonna send him back to waivers man because I look at him as a Difference Maker and two categories  and I know you disagree with this so I would not trade I would give I would offer John Collins for herb Jones all right I can't because he's gonna get shot down I would offer Chris Paul for herb Jones for a bunch of obvious reasons um Uber they're not gonna even take your call on that Kentavious Caldwell I don't think they'll take your call on that one either in giddy I just got to see more from this Guinea thing to just to just give away for up for her Jones here but I know you're disagreeing with a lot of the stocks go ahead giddey in the rankings that I am looking at  which I need to get in the habit of just going to the RotoWire  rankings and not use this other website that I love  giddey  is a 20th round fantasy player right now 200 and 233 overall  11.8 points  0.83 5.7 rebounds 4.3 assists  0.7 steals  0.5 blocks 42% field goal  and he's got this legal thing hanging over his head  Jalen Williams going off Chet homegrown going off SGA Ty Halliburton Junior  got all these guys blowing out of random giddy just like out there on an island by himself  you know  giddy's hurting your team more than these helping you right now trade just getting get herb Jones a third round fantasy stud running him out there every night be done with it all right so I'll talk I we tried to help you hopefully we did in some kind of way um and again like who's better right now clearly I would rather have herb Jones in my lineup then Josh Getty there's no question about that I just wonder if things change a little bit for giddy moving forward that's that's where I'm at man um doc anything else you want to tell the people before we say bye-bye  well yes you need to click on this thing hit the
