welcome into a Wednesday November edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast the whale and Brandon Kravitz here with you as we are every Wednesday and Brandon we got a three game NBA slate last night to break down your Orlando Magic where it actually gets the Clippers we'll talk a little Nick's calves we'll talk about some Victor Weber takeaways from what turned into a wild finish in the Spurs game a game that looked like Phoenix was gonna run away with you know kind of Midway through but hell of a comeback by San Antonio will break down all of our takeaways there we'll talk about some players who are off to a slow start you know one week into the season whether or not we're panicking about said players will hit on some guys who are in the opposite Camp you guys who are off to a fast start how real is it should you be looking to sell high in fantasy League's but first and foremost Brandon I know it's been more than 24 hours I know you Steve and Bob talked about it on the podcast a little bit yesterday but I want to you know discuss some of the fantasy and gambling rainbow missions of the James Arden trade that broke at like 3 a.m. my time yesterday morning  well I mean I can't say I'm totally shocked I thought that this would happen relatively quickly and and we figured that it would be to the LA Clippers so this is we're sort of on schedule when it comes to all of this  I mean the the most simple take on this whole thing is that long-term this doesn't really move the needle I think it will it will enhance some regular season success for the Clippers who already are in a pretty good Groove they're playing some great basketball and I'm not just saying that because my Orlando Magic got walloped last night they were playing well coming into that I think James Harden will help in that regard but how can you really trust this team when when it comes to the playoffs I know that they're title odds have shifted they're now I believe third the last I checked as of yesterday at least third in the west behind the nuggets and the Lakers I'm or the Lakers or the nuggets in the Suns I'm not buying that at all I think there's almost a 0% chance this works in the postseason so why is that exactly is it as obvious as James Harden just doesn't show up we don't trust Kawhi Leonard to be healthy because I think when you look at this just on paper you have four in my mind no doubt lock probably first ballot Hall of Famers right in Kauai PG Russell Westbrook who people forget is still on this team and I think it's probably going to be marginalized a bit with the addition of James Harden and then hardened himself I mean those guys are you can say it's as good of a chorus we've never seen put together in terms of pure talent but I for me like hardened is the piece that I trust the least you know I could see things finally breaking the Clippers way healthwise they've had so many you know tough breaks throughout the last couple of years and obviously that's what you sign up for when Paul George and Kawhi Leonard are your two front men and I mean Paul George's secretly missed more time to Kawaii since those two have been together with the Clippers so I think we always think of kawaii as the guy getting hurt and kind of you know ruining their season but it's been a little bit of both and you know I think chances are one of those guys ends up being heard at some point and we'll see where they are come playoff time if they're fully healthy willing to entertain it just because the talent level is so high but at the same time they shipped out a lot of depth you know they like three swing men you know all go to Philadelphia we'll see what the Sixers you know end up doing with that if they try to you know use some of these assets that they acquired from the Clippers to flip those you know perhaps at the trade deadline or even sooner to make an addition on their end but yeah I I kind of with you on the Clippers like it's just amazing to me that we have these four hall of famers together and collectively everybody just kind of shrugs their shoulders and it's like yeah I don't think it's gonna work well I mean what evidence do we have that that it is acquire Leonard had that had a great run with the San Antonio Spurs there was a buttoned up organization that was on the tail end of a dynasty and he was starting to break out he gets shipped to Toronto that was a team that was a Kawhi Leonard type of player away and he put together one of the most masterful postseason performance is that we've ever seen he's the guy that I kind of worry about the lease just because if he is available he'd be the reason he would be the Catalyst that got them to the NBA finals but he hasn't been able to stay healthy and last in one of the reasons why the perception exists that you talk about is because of the last postseason he was playing great got hurt wasn't available Paul George as you mentioned availability as an exactly been his calling card and being locked in focused and great and clutch situations in the playoffs isn't something that James Harden's ever really been great at he did have a nice run with Houston in the playoffs if you look at his playoff numbers they're not that  bad but in closing situations where you need them the most he doesn't show up and he's only deteriorating as a player there's just a lot of ifs and well yeah butts when it comes to the Clippers in NBA 2k you can run away with the championship when I have to worry about these four egos working together in throughout the season I can't buy stock into that too many variables I'm with you on that I I do think you know if they run into a fully healthy Denver team that that's not going to be close I think I think the continuity that Denver has you know outweighs the the overall Talent level with the Clippers you know the reason that I'm not just totally writing them off is because I think a lot of the things that we just said about the Clippers we could say about the Lakers and the Suns right I think we have significant injury concerns about LeBron and Anthony Davis you know I think we've already seen you know Bradley Beal miss all four games for the Suns Devin Booker's banged up Kevin Durant is best as much time as anybody over the last few years so like I think there's a world in which you know other teams break down and if the Clippers could just stay relatively healthy like they can at least be in the mix like I'm not just completely tossing them aside like I think there is a world in which the Clippers are in the Western Conference Finals like I don't think it's that crazy and they move from 17 to 12 to 1 by the way to win the title at DraftKings but I understand the other side of it where does that Rank by the way do you if you have that in front of you where are they in the in the hierarchy of the  of the NBA are they right now at DraftKings it's you know Celtics and Bucks are basically both for the one at the top nuggets five to one son seven to one Clippers and Warriors 12 to 1 Lakers 13 to 1 and then the Sixers moved only from 17 to 1 to 18 to 1 in the wake of this deal I think that's because that number was already baked in assuming that James Harden wasn't going to be around they just the market didn't know where Hardin was going to play so it didn't shift another team's number but yeah that that makes sense for Philadelphia and Philly the I don't know if you were ready to transition over to them but they're an interesting part of this equation too because they can make a move how they handle this is going to be really fun to watch I think we all know the Clippers thing likely going to end in disaster and we'll just watch that play out on live TV for the Sixers they can make a move by the deadline to enhance their Ruster they can make a move in the summer to enhance their rust or they could have a conversation with Joel embiid closed doors where he says yeah you could do all the work you want I'm done with the Philadelphia 76ers and based on the assets they collected from the Clippers they could blow this thing up in pretty phenomenal fashion so they can go in three different directions here  with how they handle this and it really comes down to do they want to do it now and is Joel embed on board I think getting the two picks in this deal considering they had almost no leverage right I mean they were backed into a corner nobody else had really any interest in James Harden it felt all along like they were going to be forced to trade him to the Clippers at some point picking up those two picks and being able to use those in a future deal I think is huge the role players they got back at you know I think they just kind of raise your floor in the short term right and feelings look pretty good early on anyway like I think the three-man core of embed Maxi and Harris you know plus plus some of the depth they pick up like they'll still be the third or fourth best team in the Eastern Conference and then if you want to cash in some of those chips for a jack Levine or OG and Obey or siakam or whatever it may be I think that deal is out there so I think you're right that's why that's why we did not see a dramatic shift in the odds I mean usually if you lose somebody of James Harden's caliber and you don't really bring back another star you're going to see a bigger drop in that but you know there's also a belief here that it could be could be some of an addition by subtraction situation just getting hardened away from the steam I don't think you know him being around whether he was playing or not  it could have been detrimental in some ways all though  you know we I was on NBA Radio last night and we played a clip of Tyrese Maxey you know just singing James Harden's praises and saying you know how much he appreciates everything hard and taught him when he was there like there does seem to be like this weird disconnect I think between how fans view James Harden and how players view him like it's kind of a Kyrie situation yeah I don't get the impression that that is that his teammates hate him you go back to that silly white party of that was that happened over the summer where there was all like pretty much every celebrity known to man was there The Rock Kim Kardashian a bunch of rain random NBA players somehow Mo Bamba was invited to this party and Joel embiid and James Harden we're hanging out together amidst all of this drama and these trade rumors and yeah he must be a very cool guy off the court I'll give him thinking so that's never really been James Harden I don't like using the term cancer I think that that has been thrown around there and in terms of what he means to a locker room I don't think that's the problem James Harden's worst enemy is himself I don't think he puts the work in the offseason I don't think he's obsessed with winning the  report that came out when he was talking to the Houston Rockets yeah he's obsessed with scoring he wants he wants he loves the stats he's obsessed with the box score honestly be great at what we do in terms of box score he's probably a hell of a fantasy basketball player I'm thinking so in many ways on the court and off and that seems to be the issue not so much getting along with teammates oh man all right I want to talk about some of the fantasy implications we talked about the gambling movement doesn't sound like you're gonna be betting the Clippers at 12 to 1 I will not touching that I do think affiliate 18 to what is interesting like I wouldn't bet that I think it's Boston or Milwaukee in the East but if you're if you're affiliate believer I think this is probably as good as this numbers going to be if you think they're making a splash at some point who do they have to add for you to to feel like man I have stolen  candy from the candy jar here if you if you took this at 18 to 1  I look at you I don't know I mean really that was a little bit more of a heavy hitter answer that I was expecting I was  like Levine's not gonna move the needle know I just just because I think Boston is that good and I think Milwaukee has the potential to be that good that you know the Sixers adding exact Levine I think there's still a pretty distant second or third in the East because I think you know I put Boston on a slightly higher level than Milwaukee right now and again I think once Milwaukee has some time to coalesce and maybe make some some additions on the margins they can be right there with the Celtics but yeah I I think Philly you needs a bigger upgrade than Zach LaVine he certainly helps you close as that Gap but it doesn't make me think all right you know Phillies now the favorite by any means I actually I almost wonder like what Anna Dobie be a better fit for them do they go do they need you know kind of a another Score first player in Levine obviously he's not the distributor that James Harden was but is that is that kind of going down the same path as having kind of this one white player  yeah you're probably right I think the Zach LaVine move is a is a flashier one and and can help this team when they kind of get stuck in the mud I'm thinking about the the playoff version of the Philadelphia 76ers where Joel embiid is slowed down for whatever reason and then they don't have anybody else that can pack a punch offensively that's where they got stuck last year so Anna Noby that feels like the smart NBA move that feels like the smart basketball analyst says Anna be but I need to see a second option that can help when Joel embiid is slowed down in the paint so how good are you feeling right now if you have Tyrese Maxey in fantasy oh I we saw is 80P rise a little bit you know but I think there's still some caution you know before we knew exactly what was going to happen with James Harden he is seventh in per game value right now Brandon in Roto league and I don't I don't really think that slowing down anytime soon to be honest yeah I mean do you should feel fantastic he this is part of the gamble of investing in him come draft season it's one that I made many times because I just figured James Harden was going to be on the move and it felt like you know when not if kind of situation and Tyrese Tyrese Max who were waiting for that big breakout this could be it 26 Point scored in his last game I don't see why he can't put up numbers that are close to that on a on a night tonight basis and he's efficient player he's not just  fucker oh I like what I see from Maxey and now he's got all the opportunity in the world until we hit the trade deadline if the Philadelphia 76ers decide that they want to make a move but you at least have another couple of months of enjoying the fruits of your Tyrese Maxey Endeavor here here we've got a timely question in the chat here Brandon about Russell Westbrook who I was gonna ask you about freaky asks is Russell Westbrook no longer a 12 team guy I think Russell Westbrook is the primary victim of James Harden's arrival I think he will likely be pushed to the bench and I still think he sees plenty of minutes especially with some of the depth that the Clippers shed but we also have to keep in mind that you know Norman Powell has been banged up to begin the year Terrence band is yet to play I mean that's another 2025 minutes you know they brought in Bones Island this off season or late last season they want to you know get more of a look at him so you know Westbrook so far is off to a reasonable start you in terms of the county stats at 18 7 and 6 with 5 steals last night's you know if you're in Rodeo leaks I think you know the pitfalls with Westbrook you know but by the end of the year he's probably gonna be shooting around 40% the free throw percentage continues to be a massive massive issue that's only gotten worse over the last few years and if you're in a nine category League the couch turnovers he kills you there does James Harden  as a rival in La you know does that make Russell Westbrook droppable I don't know if I quite go that far no I don't think that you need to take it to that extreme but should he be sitting on your bench yes because of just the clog that you're going to see there with ball handlers with the LA Clippers and how else is Russell Westbrook really giving you value unless he's one of the primaries in that department now where you don't want to drop them is that we're talking about a team that is going to deal with injuries load management all season long so Russell Westbrook will have his opportunities maybe you're if you're in a league where you have to set your lineup only once a week rather than a daily format I think I'd be more prone to letting him go because I don't know how I'm gonna ride that wave but if you set your lineup daily then Russell Westbrook will still have days where you feel comfortable slotting them in their  we did get an update by the way on James Harden very oddly to play tonight's Clippers are at the Lakers and then they have four days off after that before they embark on a East Coast Road Trip they go out and play the New York team starting on Monday so all indications at this point Brandon is that you know they probably give James Harden a little bit of time to get acclimated and we make his debut for the Clippers on Monday November 6th that will be a four game week for the Clippers so something to keep in mind there what a quick note on Tyrese backseat by the way our guy Alex Bertha mentioned this last night on the show 91 points 19 assists and only three turnovers so far from Maxey yeah he's inefficient player this is a smart basketball player that knows how to find a spots knows how to get his teammates involved and they need him right now in in the scoring department so I like what I see from him I think that the fact that we didn't see that explosion last year that some people were anticipating maybe cooled some of the hype down but he's still a really good player and he's showing that now it's given this opportunity  all right Brandon I want to play a little game of Panic or don't panic and we'll kind of shoot some players back and forth and and discuss you know whether or not we should be worried about what we've seen through one week and you know where we're starting here we're going to the Orlando Magic oh boy they've always been a row they they got the LA sweep back to back these last two nights what's going on with Pablo Bank arrow man nine points on 140 minutes against the Lakers a season High 15% the shooting is kind of been all over the place the confidence feels like it's a little bit low are you panicking about what we've seen through eight days of Paula Bank Hero season yeah it's been a weird start specially when you compare it to last year where he started off so hot scoring 20 points every night you were getting comparisons not in the type of player but just the type of numbers he was putting up to Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James and their rookie Seasons that's how that's how Wild his start was last year again that's not an opinion that was just based on fact and numbers and we're seeing the complete opposite I think he's been really passive so far early in this season much more focused on getting his teammates involved and picking his spots I was playing his three-point attempt under every game up and last night was the first time that I lost on that one because he just hasn't been shooting the ball last night he took the shots and then they weren't falling so it wouldn't be surprised if they kind of flipped back in the other direction where he's only attempting either none or or two at the most he was one of five from three point range I don't know exactly what it is because Talos never gonna turn into the star that we all anticipate if he's this passive I'm gonna blame FIBA a little bit maybe that's unfair I don't know Jalen Brunson has had sort of a slow start we've seen a slow start from Austin Reeves hasn't really impacted Anthony Edwards I mean it's not like Universal by any means but it's seems like a couple of these guys that played in FIBA are off to a slow start I'm wondering if that has anything to do with Palos just played a lot of basketball over the last year his usage rate is down more than 5% Edge points compared to last season which that's just not typically what you see from you know a guy like him coming in second year as a number one overall pick you know if anything you usually see a 5% jump in the other way so I think it gets straightened out you know it's like if I drafted palate hero I'm not I'm not looking to sell them off right now for one you'd be selling low and you know there'd be plenty of interest if somebody in your league is looking to offload him pick him up I think this might go down as his worst week of the season the free throw shooting is the biggest concern for me though Brandon I mean is he it was something that kind of Wax and Wane a little bit last season he was in the 70s but you know it is this just kind of a random slow start I mean I don't really know how you predict you know free throw shooting when we only have one one sample size of it or one season's worth of a sample size but to be as a radic as he's been so far that to me has been the strangest part yeah I would expect that to get better I'm a little more concerned about his long-range jumper and and even some of the mid-range stuff it just it seems like he hangs in the air a little bit too long there's something off about his his the full form of his shot not necessarily the release but the timing of the release and it just seems like Paulo and they say that if you missed short then usually that's like the most correctable way to get your shop back on track but he is always missing short he always hits front rim when he doesn't make a shot and it just seems like there's a little bit too much weight on the ball when he shoots that's something I worry about more in terms of outside shooting than at the free throw line where your feet are planted anyway because it seems like it's more of a it's a jump shot problem so I'm not as concerned when it comes to the free throw line and he's gonna get his attempts he's gonna get more aggressive I think he just needs some home cooking at one home game and then you're off to a West Coast Road Trip LeBron in the Lakers I remember that last year that he that team really tripped him up last season I think it's a tough matchup because he bullies guys with his size and the Lakers are really big team so you know he's not match up dependent but in some ways and if you're looking for that big breakout to kind of how about lamelo ball Brandon somebody I grabbed in round two of my NF bkc draft paired it with Anthony Davis felt really good about that starred ad spent fantastic so far but we are we're three games in for lamelo and the shooting has been disastrous six of 24 from Beyond The Arc 11 of 44 overall from the field for lamelo the midst of band a little bit limited you know they said they're keeping an eye on them you still playing close to 30 minutes and it doesn't to me that hasn't really impacted his fantasy value all that much although you should be closer to 35 minutes per game what he's at full speed you still give me 96 you still giving you six rebounds you know the steals have been there as well so you can't really complain about that but the shooting efficiency and the quality of shots that he's taking like that that's to be his what concerns me it's like even if they start to fall at a higher rate like I just I feel like he's playing pretty recklessly so far yeah I was I am a big Steve Clifford Mark I love him as a head coach and sometimes I'll just seek out his post-game press conferences because I missed it from his days as an Orlando Magic head coach and he is all over lamelo Ball even said it the other day that you just cannot win if your best players don't play well I mean might as well have just held up a big sign that said lamelo I don't know exactly what it is other than we could point to the obvious fact that this guy didn't play a lot of basketball last year because of the injury so maybe it's just a slow start in that regard I think what concerns me the most is that you look at the matchups that he's had you should be able to Feast it's not like they've played a murderer's row here it's the the Nets the the Pistons and the Hawks and you're still struggling with those matchups so if you're asking me panic or patients by the way I just realized that I didn't even answer that when it came to Pollo patience on Palo yeah my old Panic on lamelo ball he's got another Banger of a matchup tonight at the Houston Rockets So if you can't get it straightened out there I don't know what to tell you and he plays the Pacers in Indiana on Saturday it should be another pretty advantageous one yeah this is actually a fantastic schedule early on like the more I keep looking I like it more and more they're at Dallas on Sunday back to back games against the Wizards Wednesday and Friday so I think these next two weeks will tell us a lot about lamelo ball like those those Wizards games you know he could he could go for like 40 and 20 or you know he could go to a 15 from the field we will see but he wins through the if they've like two wins through that stretch of games I mean  very rarely do you see a team season is legitimately over one week into the NBA season but it might be the case for them I mean if lamelo's shooting under 40% that's just going to be tough for them to win games you know and I don't know what's gonna go on with Miles Bridges if you know if he's back at some point that gives them somewhat of a boost but it doesn't it doesn't really change the bottom line for me I've been kind of out on on this team for for non-fantasy purposes let's talk a little weapon Yama we saw him in action last night Brandon Spurs pull off a last second win over the Sunday did not lead until 1.2 seconds were remaining on the clock Kevin Durant just gets straight up ripped by Kelvin Johnson and he lays it in just before the buzzer you know watching this game at specialty late it's like this burst don't realize that they have weapon Yamaha on the team you know some of the shots that Johnson and Devin vassell in particular we're putting up we're just difficult to watch as someone who enjoys good basketball like weapon yamas like you know jumping around in the paint like please give me the ball I have five feet from the hoop and call Johnson's like yeah I'm just gonna Bonk this you know bang this the shot off the backboard and you know try to pull up from three hero for sale did it twice in the last two minutes so it's a little bit strange to see webinar almost used as like a role player for this team you played only 28 minutes as minutes have been up and down yeah far you know foul trouble contributed to that on opening night but you know we have a four games under our belt with weapon Yama if you were somebody who took him you know late the second round or you know paid an exorbitant price for him like I saw in a couple of my auction League's do you like what you see so far did you expect more is it about what you expected like where we had on him I like the fact that he looks like he belongs I don't I don't think women Yama looks out of place at think a lot of people looked and said okay he's got this incredible skill set but he's gonna get bullied that is not the case it seems like he knows where he's supposed to be he I think he matches up well with some of the competition he's gone up against the fact that he had to eat rebounds last night against use of nurkic is to me is a great sign so I'm looking for those little things  and then the explosion will come the fact that he's sort of just and I think part of this is by Design and more maybe Gregg Popovich than Victor nyama himself but it seems like he's sort of pacing himself to ramp up to larger production as the season goes along the fact that the Spurs are competitive in these games is a really big deal as well but they were competitive the other night against who was it I'm already forgetting who they played the other night but the scene it was well they got the Rockets  that's what it was are there opening and then they're opening game I mean they were they were in that one all the way through as well so we've seen the Spurs play some good basketball they're two and two right now and women Yama is part of the reason why this team is is sort of stable so the fact that he you know the minutes you want to see get there I don't know I think we're gonna deal with that all season long but I would I expected him to get owned on the boards throughout the early portion of the season points and blocks to be there and we're seeing that and now he's starting to rebound as well so I like it I like what I'm seeing so far and he's shooting a decent percentage  Yeah I would say considering he's played over 30 minutes only once in four games and he has you know a 23 and a 26 minute game sprinkled in there like the fact that he still basically have two and a half blocks per game is really encouraging the one thing that has not been there is the assist I thought he actually looked a lot better as a passer yeah summer league and in the preseason like that was just not something that was talked about all that much in The Scouting Report and he has had more than two assists in any game yet they haven't really asked him to do that but the three point shooting too also looks good like he hit a really nice quick catch and shoot three last night you know kind of coming around to his right I mean it just looked like did not look like a seven foot four player taken that shot right I mean it was it was as quick as it gets and you know I think he's been really really confident he's been seeking out more threes which is huge for Fantasy I mean the percentage hasn't been great he's probably taking a little too many at this point and then free throw percentage wise he's right at 70 which that could have gone anywhere you know a player like him it's really tough to project at the line he's been for his size a pretty good shooter in the past but if you could get to 775% you know on five six attempts per game I think you can live with that as a rookie and I think you assume that he's going to have more games where he's playing 30 to 35 minutes you know physically he looks fine like we saw I think it was the summer league opener right where he was he was gasped like two minutes into that game yeah I think he's put some work in on his conditioning and to add a little bit of weight since we last saw in July yeah and he seems like a leader on the floor too that the players that play around and maybe don't as you mentioned defer to him enough but it's still you can feel his presence when he's on on the floor I agree when it comes to those assist numbers we we spoke before opening night or the like that for that first Full Slate it was that Mavericks game that I was trying to think about where I actually had the Spurs in that game and I had Victor one minyama over one and a half assists I thought that that was a lock well that prop did hit the over hit but only by one and he hasn't gone beyond to assist at any point so far this season that was something that we saw a lot from him in preseason specifically we went man this guy's gonna get his teammates involved so I think they need to figure out a way to have the offense flow through him a little bit more but that's where it comes back to their pacing themselves so the Spurs know that this isn't about a sprint out of the gate for this guy I think they'll get to that point where buy Christmas by the start of the new year he's gonna feel so comfortable in this offense and everything's going to really start full of flowing through him it's not like top of it just scared of having an offense run through a big he certainly did plenty of that with Duncan  well they're trying it was Sohan and it might be time to give up the ghost on that one I would like to see a little bit more trade Jones running the show I want to talk to scoot Henderson in a moment but we got a message from our friends at Underdog fantasy it's the number one platform for NBA basketball and DFS pickup contest if you have not tried

whole lot to to dissuade those questions on Monday night against Toronto another another tough outing for the rookie point guard for 12 11 points did have a career high seven assists we like to see that had a couple of steals but four more turnovers and he fouled out in 34 minutes I could not remember a rookie guard having like this big a foul trouble issues early on like this is something that you see for rookie big bang I mean he's got 16 fouls over the last three games yeah some of these some of these summer league Superstars if it's funny how we get tripped up on this every single year cam Whitmore where is he also but much more usage for the guy we're talking about right here in scoot Henderson who has not been very good early on when we worry about guards coming into the NBA this is like the Prototype of what we're talking about here where they just they just they feel like they are bulls in a china shop and I think that that's where you see the foul trouble coming into place scoot Henderson is used to using his speed his size his strength at The Rim to his advantage and right now he's meeting competition that is as big and strong and fast and physical as he is and he's finding himself in foul trouble so he's got to get a little bit more creative with his game and it just feels like he's pressing right now I can't overly judge him based on what I've seen early on it's a four-game sample size if you ask yourself this  like I see we have questions about is he a hold what did you expect there is first four games is it really that different from what you're getting right now I know it's ugly but I expected to be honest I thought I thought he looked pretty good in the preseason right and we saw a glimpse of him in summer league and like all right man he's ready to hit the ground running this is that's what I mean we get tricked by summer league all the time I mean the same game I do think the app the absence of Anthony Simons has hurt this team as well just taking away you know the most capable scorer on the roster like all the sudden  you're not down to there's not that many players on this team better like you know even like mid-level NBA players right I think they're kind of running out of depth good if he's out there with the second unit you know you're basically running around with G league is like I think he's been hurt by that I guess the way I would frame it is like if somebody's trying to offload scoot Henderson or somebody drops him in let's say a 14 Team league are you picking up it I feel like it can't really get any worse yeah um definitely picking him up I think it would be ridiculous to drop him at this point I have this stat right here 19 year old point guard top three pick and be a career debut and this is all just based on one game but just use this as a frame of reference well mellow ball zero points 05 from the field Kyrie Irving two of 12 from the field scored six points D'Angelo Russell who could not miss the other night against my Orlando Magic 4 Points two of seven from the field and you've seen what's good Henderson has done these guys struggle Jabari Smith was somebody we were all riding off last year I know that's not a guard but still a high drafted rookie last season and he came around these guys it just sometimes it takes a minute they don't burst onto the scene right away but if you love the talent and what you saw if you follow g-league at night ignite or you liked what you saw in summer league which can be maybe the biggest Mirage of all I think the preseason was a better sign better days are ahead for scoot Henderson I think dropping him would be over reactionary  I'm with you man I think we'll look back about from now and say wow remember when you had that horrible start and like I don't know that he's gonna be on Pace for you know some sort of all time you know Rookie of the Year type of season but it's not gonna be as bad as it's been so far and you got to keep in mind he's 19 he played college ball there's going to be I think a bigger adjustment that maybe we expected you know speaking of the the Portland Trail Blazers we had we had a question should I trade Russell Westbrook for Jeremy Grant  I would rather have Grant  I know it has a big great so far but I think he's gonna be more consistent and he's basically the number one option alongside Shane sharp as long as Simons is out  yeah I completely agree and and guard is so deep in general I'm not I'm not trying to chase Russell Westbrook at this point I'd rather have Grant let's talk some Jabari Smith had a question from James in the chat Jabari Smith rest of the season outlook I actually had him on my list Brandon of players that I wanted to run by you as to whether or not we're panicking and this is an interesting one for me because I wanted to draft a bunch of Jabari Smith and I just I just didn't get them almost anywhere because you have to pay up and everybody was kind of trying to get in on what could be a second year boom it played better I had his best game of the year against Golden State the other night 14 8 and 5 with a couple of steals but it's been kind of similar to last year so far you know the numbers are almost exactly in line with what we saw from him a year ago and you know the caveat being we're talking about a three-game samples so check back in a month on ajabi Smith but I think some people thought it would be you know more of a you know impactful you know kind of sudden change from year one to year two  and to me I think he liked a lot of players on this Houston Rockets roster is still just kind of tried to find out okay where do I fit in this hierarchy yeah absolutely and Jabari Smith was one of my examples for why we should why we should practice a little bit of patience with scoot Henderson Jabari Smith got going at the end of last year so you kind of figured it would roll into this season but we're seeing a different rocket team with a different head coach and they're breaking in a new bowl Handler in Fred Van Vleet so the ball distribution is different he needs to get up a lot of shots in order to Be an Effective fantasy option in my opinion and right now there's just only one ball to go around and you add Dillon Brooks to the mix you add Fred Van Fleet to the mix jailing green is always going to try and get his and I met dokas trying to get all these guys to play with him to certain system Jabari Smith last year one of the things that I didn't like was that it felt like he deferred to his teammates too much if you're talking about a guy that is gonna kind of take that more passive approach and say okay I'm gonna eat like I think he's he is almost two coachable I guess is what I'm saying in here you have I met dossier coming in  that wants these guys to fit into a new system well Jabari Smith might be overcorrecting in that regard and he is somebody that yeah I'm not am I rushing to drop him know but I would I would be I would lean more towards the Panic side because there's just there's so many shots to go around with these guys only so many shots go around and I worry about Jabari Smith getting his throughout the course of the season yeah I would almost wait for like one big game for him and then try to sell because I think right now it's just looks so similar to last season but he's going to have those those Boom games every now and then it's just Houston for being a bad team you know it's van Fleet I'm Ben Thompson Jalen green Dillon Brooks cam Whitmore Jabari Smith tari Easton when he comes back shangoo it's like there's there's like eight guys that are either trying to get there as veterans and trying to win games if you're talking about van Fleet and Brooks and then he got six other young players that you're trying to develop simultaneously like rarely does that work out well  yeah exactly and Jabari Smith doesn't seem like the assertive type that's going to demand that he gets his so I think he could be one of those guys that until he has a stretch where his teammates go man we've got to get this guy involved I think you could Fade Into the background a little bit all right we'll talk about a couple more players in a moment but we got a message from rival fantasy Lebron vs Jordan magic vs bird Berkeley versus McHale basketball is synonymous with Legendary player

it's still early in the season that's join rival.com slash RotoWire it's time to step up to the challenge on Rival fantasy we will see you in the arena  all right we get a trade question in the chat Brandon who wins the trade nine category League Jeremy Sohan Wendell Carter and Keegan Murray or Nicholas Claxton on yeco and markelle fultz so this is an interesting one  I tend to lean towards the front end of the deal I like Jeremy sohan's usage so I'm a little bit of usage snob what know Carter Junior has has a very specific ceiling but I think he has a nice safe floor so I'm digging that and and Keegan Murray I guess you could kind of describe him a similar way it doesn't feel like he's ever really gonna go off but you kind of know what you're getting there um Markle fultz is just too many games or he's just not involved claxton's interesting  where do you land on that I I lean towards the front end I'm just more intrigued by those players  it's really really close so I'll say that right I'm not really a big Sohan guy I interested to see how long they they see this you know point guard experiment through I think the offense is looked pretty terrible when he's been out there I don't really know exactly what they're trying to do that you know Wendell Carter I was actually kind of trying to get your opinion on him like you watch him as closely as anybody like he's he's often pretty slow start and he's somebody that I've always liked like per game in fantasy he's been much better than you know then total value just because he's missed so much time but even the per game numbers haven't been good so far Keegan Murray if you're in you know not category Roto League that's huge for threes you know the efficiency should jump this year as well I think I like the latter side though I want the blocks from Clarkston he was speaking like a top 40 guide last year and you know a couple we're going through it for like the third straight year with him where it just feels like the Hawks You know despite signing into the big extension they insist on playing him like 22 minutes every single night I over the years nobody has guarded you honest as well as like bam out of bio and anaco like he's the guy that you know it's giving you honest a ton of trouble and I just want to see that Unleashed and you know for Fantasy purposes it's tough to bank on it right now but I do think like if click capella goes down at any point like the Hawks don't have a lot of depth up front a coach was a guy that's just waiting to break out so I I kind of want a piece of that even if you know you have to wait until you're in the season for that to happen I would give a slight slight nod to to the second package of Claxton and folds all right well there you go we've created nothing but gridlock and you do with that what you will yeah I agree about I mean Carter you I think one of the things that we haven't seen come around yet is that corner three he was sniping in the preseason and it just hasn't really been there yet and that that's affecting their spacing and Paolo playing the more passive I'm gonna I'm gonna assist as a big I think is impacting some of window Carter Juniors numbers so when we see Pollo become the score that he was last year I think you'll see you'll see Carter kind of get back to his what he was last year all so a couple of really tough matchups Anthony Davis was completely locked in the other night  yeah he's bounced back from that that very poor second half on opening night if you took Anthony Davis in the first round it's looking good so far but you're never gonna rest easy when you spent the first draft pick on Anthony Davis but it's it's good all right thoughts on Jalen Johnson yeah this is been one of the if you're looking for like a short list of breakout players a week into the year Jayla Johnson is probably at the top of that list he is a top 60 fantasy value so far in Roto League the numbers aren't completely over being you know you had 21 I'd opening night since then has had three straight games where he's been in double figures between 11 and 14 points you know he's not not taking a ton of Threes doing a lot of his work you know get into the rim the Steel's numbers have been there the rebounds have been there you know Atlanta has kind of a convoluted situation on the wing you got like a first round pick last year and AJ Griffin DeAndre Hunter is always hanging around Sadiq Bay is in the mix as well but I think jail Johnson is played so well early in the season that it's gonna be really tough to keep him off the floor and we've already already now seen him moved into the starting lineup for the last two games yeah this one's sort of hurts my one of my priests pre-season draft darling Sadiq bag because he's been out playing him and so I think he's he's earned a larger distribution of the minutes then then what you're seeing from Bay and as long as he he maintains a positive shooting average there's no reason why this guy can't be in the discussion for most improved player he is one of you think he's been one of the great stories early on this season so we see this every year we get this this first couple weeks blip from some names that we maybe didn't necessarily expect but I love what I'm seeing from Jalen Johnson it looks real so hopefully our eyes aren't deceiving us definitely you know and what I've seen so far  yeah I  probably got some Jalen Johnson is he what I lived in Madison he went to high school like 10 minutes away I used to go when I like fancied myself like a scout as like a 22 year old I was like I'm gonna go watch this this Prospect play I have never seen anything like that in terms of how dominant he was like I want to like a small you know Rural High School where it's like oh you have good players like this dude would have averaged like 80 points a game in the conference that I played is like it was it was ridiculous like he went to like a big school and played other like good schools in Wisconsin and it was not even close I mean I'm sure you see plenty of that in Florida where the you know the overall level of basketball is higher but I just never seen that kind of discrepancy between you know one guy on one team who was like six levels above anybody else he was playing against well I'm around the corner from the Mount Verde cab Academy so yeah problem now I'm not I didn't I certainly didn't average double digits but you know there there are people that yep yeah for sure I play played video games there yeah so you're telling me he was he was dominating a young Nick Whalen is that what you're trying to well thank you I mean he's younger than me so I wasn't I wasn't available to be dominated at the time but believe me I was I was beating down by plenty of players we played Myers yeah Myers letter did an au game once that did not go well I Believe It or Not by short white guys was absolutely murdered by him but that's a story for another day all right interesting question here from lwc should I trade Ben Simmons for Rudy gobert just got this offer I would say absolutely yes I Pro gobert I'm kind of on an island there I understand it he's Vindicated me so far the points the rebounds the blocks the been there I've said it a number of times on this I've said it to you like I think last season was the Baseline for Rudy gobert and I think people are talking about it like he's 36 and not 31 and you know not somebody who's played somebody to 75 games pretty much every year of his career so he was somebody I was picking up at a discount and right now I'd rather have him that Simmons I just I don't really trust Ben Simmons at this point yeah I think it all so comes down to roster construction what do what are your bigs look like yeah do you need to start a center is if that's the case at Ruby gobert clearly has more fantasy value than than Ben Simmons does curious to see what he's able to do tonight against yokich by the way because it of all the teams that matched up with the nuggets in the playoffs You could argue the Timberwolves matched up with them the best in the opening rounds so but in a curious Line Tonight by the way Minnesota only a 2.0 Underdog at home against Denver something to keep an eye on I think I might be on Minnesota tonight and your boy Rudy gobert would be part of the reason why  it's credit he's a top 40 fantasy asset thus far like Simmons versus go Bears really close it's actually closer that I would have thought and part of it is that Ben Simmons is just not taking any free throws so it's not killing you that he can't shoot free throws you know that was something that that really held it back and wrote a leaks like even even during his Peak years when we thought he was you know on track to be like a perennial All-Star he was taken five and a half free throws per game and he was Judy 56 60% you know which is just killing you but you know now through through what three games he is attempted total free throws and he made one of them missed one of them so if you continue to do that if he's not getting to the rim if he's not getting fouled that actually helps his value in a roundabout way  and you know points have been there to a lower degree you know rebounds he's not exactly 10 boards and all three games he assists have been good he was blocking shots that at like a similar clip to go bare which says more about gobert that it does Simmons so it's a little bit closer that I would have thought I'd still prefer gobert I think there's a little more trust there for me but you know worth noting that that the lack of free throws was actually helped Ben Simmons yeah can we get Ben Simmons to to can we change his designation around the around the fantasy basketball world because he's it seems like he's effectively their their Center at this point that's a really small lineup and you just look at some of the stats that he's compiled he's like their best big the Nets are a weird team man they're very weird team I don't know exactly I don't know exactly what they're trying to do and you know this actually you know kind of ties in well to a question we just got from from church here regarding Camp Thomas you know would you trade Maxi or trade Camp Thomas or I see what's Maxi Plus Camp Thomas for LaBella ball  I don't think you can do that right now I think I almost rather have Maxi I mean the campus is almost just a throw-in in this and obviously you know in a nine category League you're you're chasing the points with Camp Thomas it's about always giving you but I we've seen Camp Thomas like whenever he's out an opportunity literally every single time he's played 25 plus minutes he's gone off like there's no sugar bet in the NBA then Camp Thomas putting up 20 shots if the minutes are there  is this is this the year that it finally takes and he plays 25 to 30 minutes consistently because it feels like every time he's been giving this chance you know there's an injury or that you know that's just traded somebody and he gets to gets to go off for a week but there's always an endpoint to it and you know I'm wondering is this the year that we could finally trust him for more than a week at a time I think so because it feels like this Nets roster is the one that they're gonna roll with throughout the course of the season and I don't think that they're going to be a buyers at the deadline or anything like that his production is always been inhibited by some Superstar coming back and playing minutes and that's just not going to be the case so he's been definitely playing above his head don't get me wrong but I think that he can maintain a decent average I can't wait until the Nets play the Wizards to get a compass Jordan Poole had to head Showdown I don't know when that is coming but Jordan Poole good like the Chuck off  he might be the most Reckless player in the NBA I was  gone as well as I hope  so far like  it's three viral  where or two nights ago where you know kind of tries to turn around and flip up a quick three and pours against just like effortlessly blocks it you can see like pools already holding the pose like before he realized it got blocked he had the the turnaround Miss in honor of Nick Young over the weekend and it's we're like three games into this and he's already providing lightly comedy  yeah this is this is the Jordan Poole experience and I think we're learning that Steve Kerr was was doing a good job trying to rein him in and now he is being let loose and I really liked him in fantasy for that reason I'm like all right now you're going to get a Jordan Poole with know with the with the reins off but you're also seeing the downside of that I think the race might be too off at this point exactly it needs me some direction and I don't know if anybody on the Wizards is going to get his ear all right any other players or teams Brandon or anything from tonight's late that you want to hit before we head out uh yeah though there's a couple of plays that I've got for tonight I'm looking at I haven't placed it yet but I am intrigued by the Minnesota Timberwolves at home plus two against the Denver Nuggets it's just hard to pull the trigger because Denver is such a wagon right now but that line is so fishy that I have my eyebrow raised I really like the Bulls plus five at Dallas this is a team that matches up really well with the Mavericks and we've seen that when the Mavericks play a team that's beneath them they tend to sink down to their level Lucas been amazing I mean you I would play his over on points at 32 and a half because he's going over that total in three straight games so let's just ride the hot hand but I went back and looked last year Chicago and the two meetings against Dallas they won both of them I think this Bulls team they're not good but they're good enough to keep up and keep this within five so that would be that would be my biggest play for tonight he had the game that I'm actually really interested in is Grizzlies Jazz I have plenty of fantasy interests on the Utah Jazz a lot of investment in Kessler and Market in but Memphis is very quietly off to a disastrous start to the season I mean they've really not even look competitive for like half of the minutes they've been out there I think they obviously Miss Java rants they miss Steven Adams and you know guys like Bane and Jerry Jackson like they've done about what you expect so far in fantasy but it's not translated to wins and if they lose this one to the Jazz I mean I think we are we've had enough of a sample to at least start to worry a little bit about Memphis I am already about Memphis because yeah it's just too much on Desmond Bane right now teams are are the teams of quickly learned and I don't think it took them more than a half that if you can slow down Bane or just make sure that nobody else gets involved and everything funnels through him and make life a little difficult for him they don't have a second punch and that was the beauty of Desmond Bane  that Desmond Bane was the other guy when you were worried about John Morant and that's how they would kill you and then oh Jerry Jackson with the putback now it's just it's the Desmond Bane show and deeply easier to defend than than John Moran so they're they're up against it offensively and and Utah it's hard to fade a team that's already  oh and four on the season they're they're in desperation mode already but I just have no confidence watching this team right now  they lost to the Wizards that's oh that's your if you're losing to the Wizards this early in the season that is a free win that is a free win that game wasn't really even that close you know you listen to the Mavericks listen to the you know lost a close one to Denver that's forgivable Pelicans that's fine whatever can't be losing by seven to the Wizards you just can't be doing that well and on that note good you know good to get some Wizards talking at the end of the Pod Brandon thank you for joining me yeah we thank all the listeners everybody tuning in live everybody checks us
