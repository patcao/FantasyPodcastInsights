welcome into the RotoWire NBA basketball pod Nick Whalen Brandy Kravitz here with you we're gonna be talking nonstop the break we'll take live viewer and listener questions later in the episode as well let's hit it  Brandon what's going on man it's been a long week since chatting with you we don't have a ton of basketball news unfortunately to get to perhaps fortunately I know if you were grinding away at the Orlando Magic Arena I will always call it the Amway Center I have no idea what it is currently called I'm still this is the case for like every Sports Arena Stadium this you know NFL Hockey baseball MBA like whatever the stadium was named in like 2008 is what it will permanently be in my head yeah I haven't come around on the kaseya center quite yet that's the mind that's where the Miami Heat play but I call it American I think I still call it American Airlines or yes  yeah I totally get it now I'm contractually obligated to not call the Amway Center so I have made these Swift change to and I drive a Kia so it's easy I was easy from day one to make I'm not trying to brag or anything oh no you drop a kid so he sent her rolls off the tongue for me I I was right people complain when we don't talk basketball right away so we'll try to keep this brief but because you brought this up I will say so I'm like softly in the market for a new vehicle like I have a Chevy Malibu that I tolerate don't love I had a Ford Fusion that I absolutely loved it started on fire two summers ago so I had to get rid of that one was not not salvageable not on fire like we would talk about stuff Curry from the three point line actually like firefighter this is like an NBA Jam situation like it burned out my garage fire yeah that's a story for a different day but he is in Hyundai's in the Milwaukee area at least are notably discounted I mean they're like 30% cheaper than any other used vehicle because there's a there's a there's a epidemic of car thefts in this area by a group known as the Kia boys with a z and they they like film these exploits there's like a YouTube documentary there's videos on social media it's like a bunch of high school kids that go around stealing Kias in Hyundai specifically because apparently there's something about those two cars that makes them easy to steal you can like Hotwire them with a USB that's the rumor at least so I have the key of boys made it to Orlando  not that I'm aware of but I remember after I bought I bought the car not too long ago and I remember telling somebody that I work with at the iHeart station in Orlando that I work at and they go you know Kia's are the most stolen cars in America and I thought well this is really good information to learn after I bought the car and now I'm hearing about this and I think that this might be the reason why they have soared to the top of the list but  I just I choose not to live in fear Nick and it's a good car so I I still becomes with the comes with The Branding Kravitz stamp of approval and if it gets stolen it gets stole it you know this why you have car insurance all right let's talk some all-star weekend you know we didn't do a pod on Monday with Alex he was off it was a company holiday President's Day Of course that was stuck up on me and you could have told me President's Day was literally any day of the calendar and I would have believed you so I have not really had a chance to fully vent on all-star weekend we talked about it a little bit on the serious exam show which by the way has now moved to a daytime time slot thank goodness 12 to 2 p.m. Eastern you can catch us on Sirius XM fantasy  I think this is gonna go down as a disaster for the NBA that seems to be the primary takeaway I personally branded think this is completely overblown I think this is kind of a manufactured controversy where the NBA is almost hurting Itself by trying to convince everyone that all right this is the year everybody's going to try we sent in Dr J we sent in Larry Bird you know they talked to the guys they're gonna play hard  maybe I'm in the minority here I'm okay with the NBA being an exit or the All-Star game being an exhibition game I don't really need four quarters of NBA Finals game 7 intensity I will say it's maybe swung a little too far in the lackadaisical Direction you know we got Luka Duncan throwing up three quarters quartz shots you got guys you know whipping the ball out of bounds all over the place like it was embarrassing at times I will give that to the NBA but I think there's a medium here where it doesn't have like the NBA seems to want this to be as intense as possible and the players want this to be as you know Streetball as possible which is totally fine because I think that's the fun part of the All-Star game is you know Tracy McGrady wearing two different shoes throwing the ball off the backboard and you know that's that's kind of what I come to the all-star game for yeah I think the proliferation of Threes maybe that's the issue like we're not seeing as many dunks or not seeing as many like highlight dribble moves passes things like that  it's turned into each team shooting 73 pointers which is just not an appealing product so I get that but I think this whole thing about the All-Star Game needing to be competitive I just I don't feel that way as a fan  yeah I'm gonna make a very obvious statement and we'll go in more depth than this if you don't like it if you don't think it's good if it's not the competitiveness that you're seeking out which I think you're you're turning on the wrong show that's what you're looking for don't want it your eyes are your wallets in this situation if you don't like what the NBA is doing with the All-Star Game watch something else and then check back in when they start playing regular season games again or if you're among the the community and I doubt anybody listening to this is in that group because you play Fantasy Basketball but if you think the regular season they don't try hard enough there check in during the playoffs you know you can speak with your viewing patterns rather than just watching something that clearly makes you miserable they're so many people and that and this is what I come back to as I've talked about this for the last couple of days what exactly do you expect when you turn on the All-Star Game and why do you think that in 2024 it's that different from what it was 20 years ago I give you the 90s were different the 80s were definitely different I think they were hard failing each other in the 70s this is not Pete Rose running a catcher over at home plate you know that those days are gone in any All-Star Game in the NBA the NFL did away with their All-Star Game altogether for exactly that reason we are far removed and I think every fan would agree I'd much rather my star player be healthy and optimized come playoff time then to give it a Max effort during the All-Star game because at the end of the day who really cares Nick I want it back and looked at highlights from 2008 this was almost 20 years ago people are saying that we have reached an all-time low for All Star Games go back and watch the highlights from the 2008 All-Star game which our precious  Kobe Bryant was a part of who always gave it his all that looked exactly the same as what we watched but you brought it up it's the three-point shot we're seeing way more threes and so it looks different he said exactly what I was going to say which is I think we are misremembering you know the All-Star Game historically and I know if you go far enough back yeah it used to be at least more competitive but you know I think the the score is one thing that was shocking right seeing seeing 211 on your score graphic that was not what Adam Silver wanted I thought the the Trophy presentation by silver was incredible the well you scored the most points there you go like that was just that was that summed up perfectly I think how Adam Silver felt about this he was visibly upset and I think embarrassed in some ways but again  you know why did they think things were going to change this year what what changed over the last calendar year other than having you know two old guys in Julius Erving and Larry Bird tell the players hey please play hard like what what changed why why would this be the year that everything was that switch would flip I have no idea and you're totally right you know they replay these old All-Star games especially during the All-Star break like I have MBA TV on in my office all day every day and they replayed these old games it looks the same and yeah the scores were lower but the equivalent of scoring 200 points in 2005 was scoring like 150 points which is what was happening in these All-Star game so yeah I think there's this Collective like we're forgetting that the All-Star game is never really been all that competitive I like you said about the threes that's the one thing that you know it's maybe gone a little too far everybody you know you just come down toss up with three all right somebody grabs a rebound go to the same thing on the other end there were not as many threes in previous All-Star games we were seeing more dunks we were seeing you know more one-on-ones you know there's some of those classic clips of like you know Kobe and LeBron going one-on-one for a possession like you get these the singular highlights within a game I just pulled up a random one 2006 All-Star Game this was a 122 120 win for the East and this was at the time that teams were scoring like 85 points a game oftentimes this was Peak Detroit Pistons Rasheed Wallace Ben Wallace the Easter Conference attempted 213 pointers in that game 21 and it all star game we've like quadrupled that yeah so I to be that's that's the thing I would fix is I don't you can't really go out and tell the players like hey stop taking threes but just be like hey just cool it on the threes a little bit I think it'll be a better product if we do a little bit more you know kind of singular one-on-one just try to do something that's not you know Jack of three four seconds into the shot clock I think that would actually go a long way toward improving the product I have an idea I have an idea that just Sparks in my mind with you bringing that up because they used LED courts throughout the course of the weekend and I don't know if these led courts are play Ready they were good enough for dunk contest and three-point shooting contest but I heard commentators say this is nice but they're a little too slick to be played on but if they get to the point where you can do that it would be fun if during the All-Star Game there were moments where the three-point line just disappeared but they actually were able to take the three-point line out of the game and then other times in the game it reappeared Oh look The three-point line is back they could spice up the game that sort of a way and and create this more of a need to go on on one because here's the thing you're right there were more threes but it's not like this looked like a college basketball game where it was clink City they were going in like that was the thing that I was watching this game and I was amazed now did I see Max effort absolutely not I'm not trying to paint a picture that doesn't exist but Nick these guys were not gonna down I don't have the person do you have the percentages in front of you I think they I think both sides shot a pretty high percentage that's what it felt like watching it I think the East especially but this is not updated on basketball reference for some reason yet I could find I could find any box score but yeah I mean the East specifically shot the lights out I think you know I mean Tyrus Albert had five threes and like the first five minutes of the game that was in that was awesome like yeah there's shooting more threes so the the East yeah you're right the East shop 43% the  West 35% but these guys 973  it's crazy  the East made 42 the West made 25 they're shooting too many but they're all so they're making them those are those are good numbers for a regular season game and and they're and from where they're shooting the ball from so I think that that is the way that we are definitely choosing we're looking through the nostalgic lens and it's warping reality the All-Star Game really hasn't changed that much from an effort standpoint but shooting threes at a high clip looks like you're not trying as hard it's the same thing people complain about during the regular season it's the same thing I hear people complain about when they play a pickup game at an indoor court it's like everybody just wants to jack up threes it looks like you're not trying as hard as when you go into the paint  yet again Steph Curry has ruined a basketball Brandon he's done so it's a mix its a mix of the top two stars because Steph Curry brought ushered in the volume three game that has impacted the All-Star Game and LeBron ushered in the Friendship era and so none of these guys want to go at each other because they're all buddy buddy this used to not be a buddy buddy league and that's and that's how a lot of people that are nostalgic about the 80s and 90s remember magic and bird hating each other MJ hated everyone those days don't exist these guys are out there  hugging and clowning with each other whether they're on the same team or not and that's just where we are in the NBA now I think we've a lot of folks out there have wasted a lot of breath worrying and stressing over the All-Star game it is what it is I don't think it's going to change anytime soon they would have to move it I think that's the only way without going into the specifics of the game itself I think you'd have to get it out of February these guys do try hard and exhibitions before the season starts if they have a pickup game at in Brooklyn or you know all those different places they play pick up they they go hard in those games you're not gonna get these guys are on a break they play a busy schedule they've got a busy schedule ahead the playoffs schedule is grueling a lot of those players that you saw during the All-Star Game are gonna be in the playoffs they're not going to give you Max effort if I made cotton candy for a living and you gave me a weekend off and I went to the cotton candy All-Star game I'm not gonna try his hard at as I would when I'm like I want to break it was a weird analogy using cotton candy I'm just trying to explain that and you get a break doing the thing that you even if it's the thing you love and the thing that you're great at you still need a break and even though these guys  are in that game they still view it that way I was glad that Anthony Edwards was the one guy who came out and said it like I don't want to play hard the guys don't want to play hard and he basically paired what you just said he's like this is the All-Star break it's the All-Star Game you know you people don't want to come out here and go hard to be some of these teams played on Thursday night and I think including the Timberwolves right including Anthony Edwards including Giannis and Dave lowered and Stephen Curry it's like it's not they have bigger breaks between games during the regular season then they do between their previous real game and the All-Star game so I actually applied Anthony Edwards for being the one guy who you know LeBron everybody else was like yeah you know we'll see how it goes to try to play hard and Edwards like no I'm not playing hard I'm shooting left-handed Bell and they're and you also have to compare the All-Star game now compared in think a lot of people just don't see this side of the NBA it's different than it was in the 90s or even the early 2000s these guys have functions to go to every single day they are at wherever the All-Star Game resides this is not just kick  back relax and then on Sunday night you play a basketball game it's so much more intense than that and so these guys are worn out and they're already worn out from the season I'm not trying to throw anybody a pity party but just understand the this is a this is like a work convention while you while everyone else in the league is allowed to kick back relax and hang out with their families and these guys are still in a position where they're supposed to entertain you they just yeah they don't care and I don't think there's really anything you could do about it  all right so we got a comment here says they should play the All-Star Game by conference which they did do this year the winner gets game seven at home they will start trying harder  I don't think so I don't think so I mean the majority of the guys in this game probably know they're not playing in the NBA Finals right you know it was Scotty Barnes gonna go really super hard for the 17-in Raptors because you know they have a chance to get game 7 at home I just don't I don't think they tried this in baseball didn't work and they changed it for exactly that reason it doesn't matter it doesn't work  now if I know some people have said oh you you know pay everybody 5 million dollars and then they'll go hard like maybe I don't really think that's the way that the MBA wants us to go or you're just paying off players to try a little bit harder I think that's a weird look too it's a weird optic because these guys already make so much money and now they need to make loads more in order to care about this that the only way to change it in terms of effort is to move the date I think it's and things have just simply I know you it's always been in this spot but just based on the way these guys are managed as athletes the schedules that they now have in front of them every series is seven games in today's NBA that was not the case back in the day I I think if you want Max effort  make this a Christmas event at do you agree if they said if also rather than an All-Star slate on Christmas Day this game was on Christmas do you think they would try harder I don't think it'd be enough time right I mean that'd be too early in the season whereas you know now it's like the two thirds Mark that would be like the 1/3 Mark know I don't I don't think I don't think that would change anything to be honest no and you know you could move it after the NBA Finals you know more of like a pro bowl type of structure I don't think that would help I think there's nobody would tell and what's their season ends those guys are on vacation they're not they're not flying back from Tulum or whatever to go play in the All-Star game I think we just have to accept that it is what it is and I think Adam's over needs to stop trying to convince everybody that it's that it's something that it's not Matt Carmody noted bucks fan in the chat says as a box fan it was nice to see Lillard do well I agree big weekend performance for him this year yeah one the one the Three-Point Shootout back to back first guy to go back to back so it's the great Jason kapono in 2017 2008 obviously took home All-Star game MVP have we ever seen a slumping player like lizard used the All-Star game as a means of getting his confidence back  feels like a first to me I'm sure that if we looked hard enough we could pluck out somebody that has done this but three point shooting winner and the All-Star game MVP I'm not even sure that's been done before and especially for somebody who hasn't really been playing up to his standards so I am I'm not naive enough to think that this is a spark to the season for Damian Lillard but I will be watching for it  so last thing on the All-Star game then we'll move on we'll talk to Fantasy we'll talk to the futures  Dunk Contest was a disaster disaster I mean The Telecast was one of the most thoroughly confusing hours of Television that I've ever watched like the scores didn't make sense the dunks were bad they completely missed a Jalen Brown junk at one point the camera just never turned it didn't see the dunk we saw it on replay that was great I mean it was it was bad I think this was bad as it's ever been and there's been some pretty bad ones in the last decade or so do we need to make the Three-Point Contest the Marquee events like should that be the end of the night should everything build toward the Three-Point Shootout and everything you know maybe build toward I think we're gonna see more of this you know Steph Curry versus Sabrina Seth Curry vs Katelyn Clark you know maybe we get some other players in the mix get some more jumpy MBA promotion that I'm totally fine with that I mean that to me ended up being the highlight of the night whether the NBA intended that to be the case or not  I am not an abolished the dunk contest guy I love it too much there's too much history there's too many great moments over the years that have come out of the dunk contest I think this was something where they need to find a way to motivate players like I would actually be okay with them raising you know the payout to participate in the dunk contest I don't think you I don't think you could pay off players who are already making 50 million dollars to try harder in the All-Star game but if you're putting five mil on the line for the winner of the dunk contest maybe that pushes John Moran or Zion Williamson or you know a healthy shade and sharp if he was healthy this year to participate in that because it's just it's not a good look to be bringing up half of the field from the G League every year which is kind of what it seems like it's going to be going forward  I think the easiest thing to do is what you mentioned at the top just move it to the front just move the I think our expectations would would shift back to more of more to be in line with what we're actually going to receive his viewers if they just didn't treat it like it was the main event because it doesn't I have to force myself to stay up for the dunk contest now I'm not excited to do it I'm just I like I have to then stand up from the couch so I don't fall asleep kind of move the 3-point shooting contest does feel like it's moved into that main event stage I wouldn't be opposed and this is some of a drastic idea if they just if they just melded the skills challenge with the dunk contest where you have this you have stars that compete in the skills competition if the dunk a creative dunk was added to your score at the end of the skills Challenge and it was all sort of all encompassing and just make the skills challenge longer I wouldn't be opposed to something like that the dunk contest is dead but I don't necessarily want to see it go away either the fact that Mac McClung who by the way I will have on my show later on today so oh get a chance to chat with Mac he is in the history books now with Michael Jordan  as one of the only back-to-back winners ever Jason Richardson Nate Robinson Mike Michael Jordan mcmunc that's the list it's a no disrespect to Max that's a travesty and they got to do they have to do something but  I don't think we're gonna get to a point where the stars want to compete I think that that ship has already sailed so whatever idea they come up with if we're going to be realistic about it I don't think it can involve the Zions of the world go back to LeBron's era ruining something LeBron ruined this there's no debating that he's the only up and coming top star through the history of the NBA that didn't compete in this Jordan did it Kobe did it  LeBron he LeBron decided I'm too good for this event and then every up and coming top star that followed him said yep me too  every single is not a contest dunker that's that's always been my stance on that LeBron is LeBron to me is the best in-game dunker ever and I know that's maybe somewhat controversial guys like Vince Carter and you know whoever else you want to throw out there look up look up like LeBron's top 100 dunks on YouTube and tell me there's a better highlight reel than that he is an in-game dunker he is not he I don't think he has a bag of tricks when it comes to dogs see he does his you know cock back Tomahawk that's the go-to right it'll pull out a win I'm talking about early I'm talking early LeBron like 2003 to 2000 six that guy's not doing some sort of pump action first dunk maybe because back then the standards were lower right I mean you could win the dunk contest with a 360 win middle right now that that's like a 45 although for some reason like the minimum score seem to be a 47 the other night like it's the worst dunks of the building like the scoring maybe know we got a step one is remove the judges abolish all abolish all the judges we don't need this we can vote for a winner on American Idol I can pretty sure we could figure out how to vote for a dunk contest winner just put it in the app put it in the NBA app get more sign ups and have the fans vote for who they think is the the winner okay with that we have the technology is involved yeah all right let's hit some fantasy questions before we talk Futures we got some good ones in the chat here Matt says what's up guys I just assumed and Grant Williams are on waivers in my league would you drop Kelly Olynyk or Derek Lively to pick up either of them this is a head-to-head Yahoo points lie  off the top my head I think I'd be comfortable dropping a Linux for either of those guys especially assume you know a Linux he had a back injury their final game before the breaks so you see oh he played only seven minutes that was a little bit skewed he played really well it was first two games with Toronto prior to that I did bet his points over in that game I was it was not it was not voided unfortunately I still you know he still playing backup minutes to Yakko portal again the numbers look really good he had six steals in his first two games with Toronto so he's not a must drop by any means but I you know went healthy I still think he's playing like 18 to 22 minutes tops most nights whereas to sumu looks like he might be a high 30s minute guy the rest of the way Levine's not coming back depends what you need depends what your you know what more so in a points League depends on your you know your roster situation do you need a big man versus a guard but I think there's quite a bit more upside with just Sumo over a linen for sure Lively to me kind of a different case I mean he missed time you know with the the facial injury they brought into big men at the deadline we only really have one sample of him playing with PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford he had four blocks and 17 minutes against the Spurs and their final game before the break so there's not to me there's not a must drop here but if you don't pick up to Sumo somebody else is going to absolutely he should be I think he should be rostered in every League what he's been doing from three point three point land has been outstanding and you're getting assists getting a few rebounds as well not going to buoy you in terms of the defensive stats but look at what he's done this these last three games that he's played Four made threes five and five he's shut 56% in the month in the month of February and like Nick said this guy isn't going to dip below 30 minutes played the rest of the seasons so he's a he's a mustad and I'd be willing to drop a Linux as well  yeah OLX to me would be the top drop and then you're yeah I would say drop a Linux for to Sumo I'm still I'm just not the biggest Grant Williams guy but he's played really well the minute seemed like they're going to be there Charlotte has really nothing on the line here they want to maximize that you know with Lively again in a points League I think I would just take Grant Williams I think there's going to be a higher floor there in a category League you know you're chasing the blocks a little bit more specifically when it comes to Lively but I do worry what his role is going to be because they've looked I mean they've looked incredible since bringing in Washington and Gafford and I think you know those those three guys in general they probably all their fantasy value is probably lower than it was before the deadline so I'd be I'd be okay you know dropping Lively in favor of Grant Williams any points League specifically  Ian says  would you be willing if you're willing to trade DeAndre Eaton in a nine category League what range of rank should I be targeting  okay so you're offloading Deandre ayton  okay with that I don't know that he's a shutdown candidate because he is so young and they view him as a future piece but he could be you know Portland is is going to in that in that bottom Zone you know where as of right now they would have the 5th best Lottery odds it's kind of Portland versus Charlotte for that that four spot where you have the the same odds as the the top three so we'll see if Portland you know tries to do anything there toward the end of the year I again I'm not I'm not a post to offloading Aiden you know could you target  could you target someone like nurkic could you target someone like Yakima portal if you're looking for another Center  yeah I think he's got a really tough Market I don't know who's buying  DeAndre eight and at this point thinking that that's going to be the piece that puts you over the top I think you if you're gonna trade him you got to get a little sneaky with it a guy like in this would be a leap of faith but a guy like Zach Collins of the Spurs I think would get the deal done but your banking on the idea that women yamas going to be shut down at some point and then and then your mopping you have the number one big for the Spurs I think you'd have to make a move like that otherwise that's just gonna be one of those trade offers but I think that just that just sits in your inbox  yeah I mean Daniel Gafford comes to mind somebody we just talked about Clinton capella maybe you buy low on him coming back from injury that would be the general range that I would be shopping in  an unoriginal guy says hi who to drop in a nine Cat 10 Team league should he drop your images in this dude and then I saw the user name no no we're not ripping a man he says should I drop keldon Johnson or herb Jones good question here you know Kelvin Johnson is falling off a bit over the last few weeks minutes of started to decline for him Spurs rotation still a mess every single night herb Jones being wild started to play better had that you know month plus long stretch where he was just not really giving you much on the defensive end which is obviously a big concern for herb Jones that has started to come around he did not play well in their final game before the break but prior to that I had a pretty nice run no taisen Daniels for several more weeks I mean he could miss the rest of the season with the meniscus and I think that's really gonna help her Joe Jones  so in a  in a night cat League I would I would keep herb Jones and I would drop keldon Johnson you know I mean Kelvin Johnson you know there's several categories that you're concerned about whereas herb Jones is going to give you a much higher floor Kyle Johnson not a good free throw shooter the field goal percentage is all over the place defensive stats really tend to come and go it's actually been a little bit better lately than you'd think but the scoring the rebounding has been down he doesn't really generate assist so I would I would drop Calvin Johnson yeah keldon Johnson is one of the more erratic players in the NBA and that and that comes with the territory of being on a bad team but he's also part of the reason they're bad team in my opinion not a guy that you can trust gaming and game out and he gives you these Spike performances but he'll go right back he'll go from 21 points and 16 rebounds to 7 points and and one you know that I I would just rather have the safety and stability of a guy that I can trust and fills up more of those those categories herb Jones herb Jones rather would be the choice for me as well  you mad says jokic and niece Smith or Luca and Bagley going forward in a 14 team nine cat head to Headley so this I used to you know this maybe is a trade-off for that either you're throwing out there or someone as presented to you  oh this is tough man I  I think both of these guys are so close obviously yolk and Luca and Elizabeth Bagley are comparable on their own way as well  I think I would just I think I still want yokich yeah this trade come this when you have two players of this caliber that are two of the top five players in fantasy the secondary player in the trade is almost irrelevant um especially when you're talking about names like this so it really comes down to who do you want more yokich or Don chiche love both but I would still take yogic over Luka  yeah it's closed I mean Lucas been the better fantasy player for the last month or so and I think that should continue me Dallas is going to be in a dog fight for seating to stay out of the play in zone I I mean I actually I like these Smith more than I do Bagley I know I said they were comfortable I think I'd rather have an Eastman so to me that does that does break the tie so I would take the Oak Ridge D Smith side but I'm okay with either side of this I mean Luca the county stats with Dr Sharon saying right I mean it's basically 36 10 and 10 every single night so again as we always say positional need that's part of it as well if you're in a category league as you are you know you're if you need you know certain categories with Luca they're fairly comparable obviously he's gonna give you more threes I think that would be the big difference but nice Smith is obviously going to give you way more free than back so maybe that offsets it all right let's see Mr a knot doctor a mister a says do I drop the Sumo to pick up keyonte George uh no I'd keep the Sumo I'm really high on this guy I love what I'm seeing I think he's super efficient and and the Bulls are going to continue to give this guy room to grow so I'm not I'm not trying to move off of them  yeah I think this is a pressuring question because keyonte George had that crazy game before the break right where he hit like what do you finish with 9 threes in that win over Golden State  that is an outlier a big time outlier and I don't think we see a game like that again from Ki update George he's been like a 30 34% 3-point shooter on the year I do think they're going to be really comparable going forward though Captain George's gonna give you more on the defensive end I think the minutes are absolutely going to be there keep in mind Brandon that the Utah Jazz always top 10 protected pick to OKC so it seems to me that Utah has decided we want to prioritize trying to keep that pick as a supposed to gunning for the Tennessee kid if they wanted to I think they have a chance to get it you know you competing with golden state in the Lakers primarily for that but I think the indications that they've given around the trade deadline and how they've handled their rotation over the last few weeks tell me that they're okay with falling back and that means probably more key update George down the stretch but the soup has been doing it for longer he's been more consistent like you said I mean he's shooting 58% from the field over the last 15 games which is pretty huge if you're at a category League you're not going to get anything close to that from keyonte George you know I think they're going to be comparable in terms of turnovers I think defensively they'll be relatively comparable you have to George's gonna give you more assists but I I would still rather have to sumo  I looking at the Jazz schedule I will say this though and I still I would still take to Sumo as well but just just be warned that over the next week we might look wrong because yeah he's got Charlotte St Anne Tonyo Atlanta coming up and watching the mix as well after a couple of games against those Florida teams so they're just a chance at some pretty Splash games against the worst defenses in the NBA  yeah it's gonna be close it's I mean we could be totally wrong on this I just I don't think one one of these guys is going to like dramatically outpace the other I think they're both could have elevated value and I don't think you're you're going to the day that you you know you picked up one drop the other we got a couple questions on Simon's Mister a says we'll Simon's be shut down Don sicario says Anthony Simons to shut down candidate yes and no I I would lean more toward yes I can see them shutting him down late in the year you know like we mentioned Portland should be interested in finding their way to a bottom four record and you know right now they have 15 wins Charlotte has 13 wins San Antonio has 11 I think it'll be tough to catch the Spurs I don't think they're catching Washington or Detroit so Charlotte versus Portland the rest of the way for those Lottery odds is something to monitor  I mean Simon Just So Young he's a part of their core they're losing games anyway with him out there like that it's not a Malcolm situation like that that's Defcon whatever the highest Defcon is I don't know if it's one or eight or whatever if we want to go like Richter Scale that's like a 8.4 shut down Simon's to me I'm not nearly as concerned again he is Young they have a blocked up they're not winning with him anyway but yeah there's some concern there so if the question is basically you know if you're rostering him are you looking to get off of him with that fear in the back of your mind yeah I'm not really worried about Anfernee Simons as much Malcolm Brogden for sure because he's a veteran DeAndre ayton is a guy I would have real fear if they're gonna go shutting players down Anfernee Simons is a Score first player great that he puts up the numbers that he does but I don't think he's somebody at this point in his career that's impacting wins and losses so you might as well just continue to let him grow as an NBA player it would be like shutting down scoot Henderson why you know you still even though your angling four pick and I get that you still need to grow the young players that are on your team so that when you add somebody to your roster you're ready to take that step forward they could go either way with it but that would be my thinking is it would it would seem more counterproductive than anything else to shut him down  and says hey guys I got a log Jam on the wing who should I drop Josh Green Tim Hardaway Jr or tari Eason in the category League  um do we have an update on when Eason is coming back  right not really  not really and that's that's the the kicker here I worry about tari Easton specifically  because it's been so long right we haven't seen him since New Year's Day and during that time you know can't what more is taking on Thompson has taken off I think the context has changed for this rocket team and I just I don't know if they bring him back and say all right we're just handing you 25 minutes Amanda you're playing 18 minutes a game again you know can't win more you know back to play in 15 minutes a game like I just I don't know if that's gonna be the case I think there's going to be a ramp up period for him whenever he does return like he could be back this week we have no idea it could be another two weeks you know this didn't seem like it was going to be as long term of an injury as it's turned into so I I I'm not saying I don't think I need to rush out and and grabbed our Easton right now I would say I would hold Tim Hardaway I think there's still a decent amount of scoring upside there and you know most of their moves at the deadlines were concentrated in the front Court nothing really changed for him  Josh Green it's gonna be hit or miss right yeah I think when when Luca or Kyrie are out and we've seen him have some nice games when everybody's healthy the minutes haven't necessarily been there you know he's a pretty low usage player you're just hoping you get a couple of steals so I'd be I would say I would be comfortable dropping Josh green or tari Eason I would hold Tim Hardaway  yeah the Eastern Newsom looking at the the report at RotoWire lower leg injuries gonna be reevaluated around this point probably maybe even as we speak but experiencing lingering pain in his lower leg that to me does not sound like that it just sounds like one of those things that's gonna extend longer than its supposed to what does that even mean I would drop Tar Heel and stop hanging on for hope  Jason ate 10 says he wanted to drop Klay Thompson for Trey man and a nine Cat 10 Team league is this a good move man uh wild that we're getting this question and I would agree I wouldn't added Trey man all over the place last week he had a great game before the break it's really been doing everything he rebounds really well for a guard of his size he's playing a ton of minutes he takes a ton of Threes you know he's handed out at least six assists in those first three games wish Charlotte so there's  there's a real case here it kind of depends if you think bench Clay is going to be a thing here going forward I mean obviously what crazy 35 points Off the Bench 73's against Utah but it's been really really spotty other than that if you're in a category League to me it depends like how much do you really need the threes because I still think Clay is going to be more dependable he's going to give you a higher volume of three-pointers  I think Trey man is going to give you way more counting stats overall you're probably gonna have to live with if you're in a nine cat League which you are you're gonna have to live with more turnovers you're gonna have to live with some nights where he's four 15 from the field but you're also gonna get those from clay so I I think there's a real case here to pick up trade man  there's definitely a case for it it's a really good question the fact that Klay Thompson was pushed to the bench and then started to play a lot better makes me want to hold right now rather than moving off of them I want to see what this looks like you know that if he does it again and maybe even if he doesn't this guy's gonna be scored up with the quickness and there's always another tray man out there know I know I know that he's playing great but if Klay Thompson continues to  over-perform in his new role you're going to be sorry that you let him go I would just wait another moment on this  Triton says hey boys subtracting should I drop Bagley man to sumu Caruso or Middleton to pick up a sar Thompson  hmm well we're in untrain in we're in  I think it's I think it's Caruso or Bagley for me and I still don't know if I would do that you know again with Caruso you need the Steals and yeah love the defenses  yes so depends on what you need though is if you if you're good on defensive stats I've actually okay dropping him because he doesn't give you a whole lot else you know offensively rebounding assist  Bagley is a center who plays for the Wizards and they don't have many of those he's got back-to-back double-doubles  he's playing a ton of minutes that should continue we'll see you know they've started the Sean Holmes a little bit I don't know if that's that big of a threat  yeah you're in a pretty good spot here man like I don't think any of those guys stand out to me as a must drop for a Tsar who ultimately is still fairly risky I would say this if you need to move up in the standings if you're in like fourth or fifth right now and you're kind of going for something I think there's more potential upside with the Tsar than there is Caruso yeah um I would lean Bagley and and I agree you're really targeting upside you gotta limit your expectations when it comes to a sar though I think we already saw the best from him this year  um he also says Dennis Schroder and Ben Simmons are on the wire I wouldn't touch Ben Simmons I don't I'm not messing around with that Schroeder who knows you got a new coach in there the Great Khali taking over in Brooklyn  I know I I don't think I would consider those guys I think you're in a pretty good spot with the names that you that you brought up yeah Simmons is a no-go for me I added Dennis Schroder before the week before the All-Star break right after he was traded I thought I'd get ahead of the game there and  immediately throw him back on the waiver wire and I don't think I'm gonna regret it  okay last one here Hilton says for playoffs I have both LeBron and AD Yahoo points had to Hedley both of them have two games in week two of the playoffs do I try to trade both or just LeBron  yeah good question I mean that's the thing in these these had to head playoff League's is you know game Count becomes huge at the end of the season in the playoffs  it's reasonable yeah I mean I think obviously you got to be getting a pretty decent return here and you gotta hope that maybe someone else isn't paying attention to the schedule otherwise you're going to have to expect to take a discount on that deal yeah I you know I'd have to look at what the playoff schedule looks like in you know in week one and and Beyond you know those guys have four games and week one four games and week three it's like maybe you can just survive that I don't I don't know if I would trade both that might be a bit of an overreaction but yeah yeah I think who do you pick  who do you pick between those two players that think that would be the tough part too is you're gonna end up agonizing over which one can you get more for who do you want to hang on to LeBron is more likely to be held out for rest purposes but Anthony Davis is much more likely to be held out because he just simply got hurt and so you have to weigh that as well I think I would end up in gridlock between who had actually what I would do is I would just send trade offers that you know you're winning if you send them out so not unrealistic but definitely give you give yourself the edge send out offers for both and then see you know it's unlikely that both are going to be accepted and just see if one sticks  maybe just get a feeler for who's more valuable to your league mate I believe if I'm looking at the correct week here this is the week that begins March 17th the Celtics have five games that week so you know I mean it sounds crazy on the surface but do you float out like LeBron for Derek white and you know you probably getting more out of five games of Derek white then you are too of LeBron I heard a stat today Derek white leads the NBA and plus minus right now not that you get sense fantasy points for that but it just goes to show how how valuable He Is We had the segment that we did weeks ago where we talked about the players that have been populated most on successful fantasy basketball rosters Derek white was the name that popped up that I think shocked us both yeah that I would need a two-for-one on that but I like where your head's at in terms of the strategy in place  okay we got one more in at the buzzer here Brandon Curry or Lillard and kuzma and a 14 team nine category League this is a tricky one this to me completely depends on if you think Damian Lillard is bouncing back from this month and a half slump if you think he is I would take this deal 10 out of 10 times and and I would take Lily and cosma if you think Lillard's going to keep playing like he has for the last month and a half then Curry is the more valuable side of this it's really Eye of the Beholder I mean Damian Lillard  it's hard to imagine it could be any worse than he's bad  yeah and as weird as this sounds I actually think you're buying Damian Lillard at the top of the market right now because of what he did in the All-Star Game there are people that are going to look and and Elevate his value it's it's silly but he's he's he he reminded all of us it's not like oh you on the 3-point shooting contest so now he's a better fantasy player but he reminded all of us what kind of player kind of abilities he has and I wonder if that's a factor here so I do think even if it's fictitious I think his his value  you I'd rather buy low on Damian Lillard than to get him now I'd rather have Curry anyway  all right well end on this well you bless this blockbuster trade honest for Shea  in a category League yes  I would if it's category League I would absolutely rather have shea obviously the free throw percentage is the big differentiator here in a points League it's still closed you know this has been the better fantasy player by about three fantasy points per game but in a cat League I think he got to go Che it's really not that I mean they're separated by like a round round and a half right now  if Nicole yokich wasnt in the star that he was shaking just Alexander at this point would be a lock for NBA MVP and a lot of that is because of his efficiency shooting the way he shares the basketball and what he does on defense all things that factor into what make him a great fantasy asset this year it is she I agree so blessed all right good questions as always guys we got we got so many that we couldn't even talk features Brandon which is not necessarily a bad thing but we'll hit those next week we'll talk about those on both of the RotoWire shows on Sirius XM you can
