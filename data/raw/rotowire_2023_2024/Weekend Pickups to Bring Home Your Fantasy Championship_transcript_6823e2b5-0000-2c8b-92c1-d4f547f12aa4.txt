hey everybody Welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast  it's Thursday March 28th I'm doc that's Rick kamla got a lot of talk about let's get right to it this is a weird week schedule wise  and Rashawn Rashawn Holmes The Savior  the Savior no more yes yes yes yes it is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast with fswa Hall of Famer Steve Alexander acha doctor a I am Rick kamla aka the fantasy free and ladies and gentlemen um doc let's start the show with Rashawn Holmes and we'll get to the waiver wire here in a second um I had several crucial decisions yesterday that involved Rashawn Holmes okay I started him in the cam Dynasty and I don't want to tell you the people that I started him over okay um and that did not go well at all for me um in another League I had two pickups left okay and nurkic with the injury so I had to make a move there right um should have gone with Kelly Olynyk but he had one fewer game games the rest of the week then Rashawn Holmes so I picked up for Sean Holmes okay um Rashawn Holmes drilled me in two League's last night in Doc he was by far the most picked up dude and fantasy  basketball yesterday I saw on Yahoo he was at like 10,000 ads and the next closest guy was it like I don't know three four five thousand whatever that number was so Rashawn Holmes was doing it and like captivating the fantasy world and then he dropped us off a cliff last night doc saw that slow down brain in Ingram we've seen it slow down players I mean if if I had a broken toe or a really hurt toe I don't think I would be able to run very far the only thing I've got going for me is I'm I'm up so I've got Rashawn Holmes in my 30 Team league Rick and it was funny yesterday best verse and I got together and did a podcast we were comparing our teams and talking about the draft and I went back and I was like I don't even know where Rashawn Holmes came from to be on my 30 deep team but I had him in there for the last two weeks and Joe Kaiser at ESPN 430 deep winner who I rolled last week was telling me he's like dude you gotta name a dog or a kid or something after Rashawn Holmes because he just rolled me this week well I went back and looked at how many moves do you think you've made in 30 deep I'm gonna say like over 20 probably I mean I'm always one of the most active guys but I I'll say I sucked on the waiver in 30 year I just leave her wire  there is done you can't pick there's nobody to pick up I mean Delano Benson was scooped up I mean we're shot there were guys scooped up and I was on them and like here's my thing with 30 deep doc like like you need to you need to stash guys and let them germinate and I get a little bit too itchy and I want somebody who's in a rotation and you just need to kind of squat on some guys and so that anyway I screwed up I hated 30 deep I mean hated listen to this I mean one I made the Final Four  I made one move in 30 deep it was November 23rd what's one move one move I picked up God maybe that's formula I picked up Rashawn Holmes and I drop Joe the three-point shooter for the Nets what happens Joe Harris I dropped Joe Harris picked up with Sean Holmes and on November 23rd the only move I made and I I drafted Peyton for Richard  and paid Pritchard is now the man right and I drafted Kobe white and like one 209 I drive to Camp Thomas like one eighty something it was just a perfect it was a perfect storm and even with Roshan going down last time I'm still up like 25 boards and I've got windy so my big men or women were showing home's on my little guys are Kobe white deer and fox Payton Richardson campus and then I got Austin Reeves and Zach Collins holding it down in the middle of that line up like that teams unbeatable it's healthy but we can move on let's let's carry on Rashawn Holmes let everybody down he lets over a million fantasy basketball managers down yesterday probably wow uh those are big numbers right there um doc I hope you win 30 deep I'm definitely pulling for you I never thought for one second after the draft of my 30d team was going to win the chip this year I missed out on homegrown by one pick I took Josh Green over Tim Hardaway Jr and that was it and and I knew that this was not going to be a banner year again a miracle I made the final for it absolute Miracle um all right so I want to dive deeply into the waiver wire here and this is for the head to head um people out here right and you're either at a quarterfinal game or you're in a semi-final game so we have two very weird nights here tonight we have two games Saturday night we have three games Okay so the key is tonight it's Boston at Atlanta Milwaukee at New Orleans Saturday Boston at New Orleans Milwaukee at Atlanta okay and then you have a Memphis Orlando game that is kind of out on an island and don't worry about that right now because we have five games over these two awkward nights because of the NCAA tournament you have four teams playing on these two nights so these are the guys you need to pick up for tonight and then they will stay and don't drop them keep them and they will be in your team on Saturday as well in Doc here the premium guys and they're not really premium but you understand what I'm saying um Sam Houser of Boston is the get right now to me there's no question about that I would put Naji Marshall at number two I would put vide creature of the hawk pardon me I would put brutal Fernando at number three I would put victory at number four he's starting doesn't score a lot but he gives you some goodies and then you got so so I would rank it Howser and then Nagi and then Fernando and then Creech those to me are like the standout guys that you want okay now let's downshift into a a j Crowder a Garrison Mathews a pat connaughton a Larry Nance we got to look at Jose Alvarado because he got banged up in the last game and I don't know if he'll play tonight but if he does um and I presume he will cuz he's a tough guy he's gonna give you a steal he's going to give you maybe two threes maybe seven eight points maybe three four assists and you're like God bless yes this is the playoffs dude and if you accumulate this game after game after game through your week it's not about the seven points in the forests and the one three in the one steal tonight it's when you add that on to what you did off the waiver wire on Tuesday and having Jose in your lineup on Saturday it accumulates and doc I really think  it makes the difference between winning and losing because my games right now the margins are so thin these are the best of the best going for these fantasy chips you need guys like I just said so what are your thoughts on some of these guys man well I'm sitting here like this reminds me of Vintage 2003  or 2002 in the Attic the fantasy attic and 1:00 in the morning watching channel on NBA TV like digging through the Deep names and giving like hardcore like really useful fantasy information because you're right dude I got B in my rock and roll League last week because I did not plan ahead well enough I was playing the best of the best and dude had me nine games to four games on Sunday  I went into Sunday with a 7-2 lead and I lost like six to three because  the guys he had not only did he have numbers but they all went crazy that was the day that freaking khris Middleton got a triple double Zion Williamson went absolutely ballistic that day like everything he touched turned to gold and I had a bunch of stuff that I touched turned to you know what and I lost and and had it had I plan ahead better for Sunday games maybe maybe I would maybe I would have beat him but yeah I mean I think that's great advice you know I'm just looking at my 30 team here the only guy I've got going on Thursday and Saturday is Payton Pritchard of Boston but I'll take it because Drew holidays probably not gonna play and Peyton's gonna have two good games but it depends on how many guys best for says go but yeah I mean I think it's incredible advice and I like to the list in the order of the guys you gave  oh she might as well you might as well listen those again real quick for the people that were sleeping through the first time so and again guys this is a two-night engagement this is not a one night stand okay this is going to be a one night stand that was so damn good that you want to go back and do it again call to booty call if you want okay but it's a Thursday and Saturday night joint all right and the guys it's four teams it's Boston it's Atlanta it's Milwaukee its New Orleans these four teams play on Thursday and Saturday and again here's the order Sam Houser's number one number two is I'm going to say Bruno Fernando's number two Naji Marshall number three vide creature number four and then you go kind of out in the weeds a little bit and I prefer like a contestant or a Crowder uh a Garrison Mathews from Atlanta maybe then I would go back to Larry Nance again Jose would be a little higher on this list but he's got the injury that's Jose Alvarado Luke kornet lingers in here somewhere too it's on your waiver wire and you you know he's gonna get 10 minutes 18 minutes he kind of the minutes are weird but he's a guy as well so just overall you guys rank him cornette Houser Fernando Garrison Mathews I see math and I think Ben matheran on Victory Pat connotation Jae Crowder AJ Green and super super deeply deeply um Larry and Edge Junior Jose Alvarado and Naji Marshall and let me give you one more super super deep okay um and again this is if you're in a 20 Team league or a 32 Team league or a 16 Team league his name is Dylan Wendler  he's a three-point shooter has been a like 15 teams is what the Hawks right now playing like 10 to 15 minutes a game again I picked him up I'm in some League that are literally that deep and so that's another guy and right there there's other guys out there too like Malik Beasley maybe sitting out there in the league so I Rick's talking deep stuff deep Malik Beasley is available and a lot of leaks like you would pick him up a Bobby Portis but hey Richard might be around in a lot of legs right now Hayden Richard could be sitting out there so yeah so don't just automatically take that order you gotta look at who's available but the four teams again like just sure if your waiver wire for the for these four teams Boston Atlanta Milwaukee New Orleans anybody else from anybody from any other team you're not picking them up today okay and the other nice thing the nice thing about this is too you don't need to really worry about Friday and Sunday because it's so stacked everybody that thank you for the cherry on top doc that's a great piece of advice you're not worried about Friday and Sunday every league on man I got dudes and I got like three guys that aren't even in the starting lineup because I already kind of hit you know in the Yahoo League's I love this feature I love it where you push the rest of the week yeah well yeah for the rest of the week you pushed the button for that night and it slots in you can reorganize if you want but then you do the rest of the week just go boom and it sets all your lineups for the rest of the week it's dope it's such  a cool feature and then you don't have to watch that because sometimes it'll put my guy Anthony Edwards on my bench for the rest of the week is like what are you doing I just he's in there I'm gonna I'm gonna I think I'll play Anthony Edwards exactly uh I'm not saying you have to go by what they do but here here's why that feature is so cool I'm in a couple of points and I hate points leagues but I'm in them you know what the hell I but I don't like points leaks okay um I like head-to-head category leaks but I'm in a couple of points leaks right so that feature is big for points leaks because then you push you know line up to the rest of the week and you can see like what the projection is for you against the other guy or girl and and kind of like know if you're ahead or behind the game a little bit um all right doc let's get into where do I want to start here with you it is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast by the way Rick kamla and Fest w a Hall of Famer Steve Alexander um let's start with this right here Doc and it's a home drum game it was Minnesota's comfy and very boring victory over to Detroit and frankly I have three TVs on one wall I did not watch a minute of this game because there were a million games last night here's the point though doc I was very worried about Cade Cunningham he missed two games recently he was the late scratch missed the second of that back-to-back and I'm like is Detroit shutting down Cade Cunningham what are we doing here during was out at that time all the studying Jayden and I be did not play last night um and so Kate came back last night and this is a colossal piece of news for me and a lot of you he had 32 last night against the best defense in the NBA so I am totally geeked about that and I do understand Dr where maybe going to have a rocky road here with some dnps and stuff like that but he's not shut down Halifax and louyah Jalen Duren last night um 11 and 11 he's not shut down so Detroit played their hand last night doc that was the pivot point for me  are you doing the shutdown thing the start five rookie Portland thing or are you still going to play your Healthy guys critical that Detroit played their hand last night and we've got about two and a half weeks left in the regular season I don't think they're going to shut these guys now and Doc I don't know if you saw but lamelo ball was officially shut down for the season right before we came came on the air today I wrote in the my notes for this show today that do I asked a question and my question being related to Cade Cunningham and Jalen Duren and the fact that what's his face is still playing Desmond Bane is playing for Memphis right now Jaron Jackson Jr still playing from Memphis right now and my question is  does this change the future of  our podcasting fantasy hoops and and be a basketball because  if these guys are not going to be shut down these four guys we just mentioned then who is gonna be shut down we have no way of knowing so I think we need to be a little more  a little more careful about screaming from the rafters that hearing Jackson Jr so high get rid of him it's Panic time he's gonna get shut down the players have a different mentality now and it's all related to Adam Silver's rules I think and I don't think we can just say guys are automatically going to be shut down anymore we can't but there's still our support Portland's doing the shutdown thing right now so the speculation about Jeremy Grant and DeAndre ayton and Anfernee Simons that was all accurate okay and we're coming out of an era of the NBA where load management was obviously at a critical mass level and in the NBA did something about it like doc said they created a player participation policy which means you got a place 65 games to qualify for awards dang all of the Star players are playing way more games this year it is it's like absolute home run Grand Slam home run by the league Joe Dumars also said and this was more of a memo to the teams than the players we're an 82 game League all right you need to start thinking about it that way and guess what they have because Memphis is looking at it like an 82-game schedule being a selfie you play him Jaren Jackson Jr is healthy you play him Brandon Clarke is back from his Achilles injury last night made his return against the Lakers six and five in 21 minutes you play him okay so and there are some teams who are not with that um Portland comes to mind here but last year we had seven eight nine shot down teams seven eight nine okay this year we've got one or two I'm still not sure where we're going with this Utah thing Doc okay I'm I'm sorry marking keeps showing up for work I know we are until until he doesn't how short and Clarkson doing when's the last time he played I don't know what you taught is doing they're not shutting down right now they're not they're not starting Walker  Kessler and that makes me want to literally have a very tough conversation with Will Hardy with a six foot five three and 30 pound bouncer right next to me look what are you doing how does he not start Walker Kessler dude does that make any damn sense to you on any planet  and every Walker Kessler get this guy on a team that appreciates him man my God this is been a long year for Walker Kessler managers it is not been Pleasant  I can't even say hey in a dynasty league go sell go buy low with him  I don't really want them right now either Will Hardy  you know I don't want to say anything more than that hey Rick I got a side note here the ramp the Rick rants are on point today so  here in scratch your at RotoWire he wanted he played high school basketball with Sam Houser first of all right and he and he and I have been doing our the Tuesday show together and Marcus Sasser is the guy that was kind of getting hot when Kate Cunningham was out and I called him Mackey Sasser ah you you know who Mackey Sasser is of course it was a catcher back in the day of course I know who he is absolutely Macy Macy Matt hacker Macy's Sasser with the Mets Mackie the hacker they call him I'm calling this dude Mackie Sasser and I thought that was a today is opening day in baseball and that's probably what you and I are doing as soon as we're done here is turning on so baseball games I may have to I hold on a second I got to see what I have not set my lineups today for I've been working um what do we got here when are you setting baseball lineups right now no I just I got I'm actually on espn.com looking wait the first game today is not until 3:05  okay  what I thought there was a noon game know I'm on it right now hold on let me look at the right day yeah 305 is the first game which is weird am I the Twilight Zone what that it feels they've always started it noon for opening I don't know not sound right to me Thursday March 18th and the first game at 3:00 Doc it's March 28th  what is going on here  uh no I got it right I got it right the first game today is at 3:00 angels and Orioles all right who cares it's Rick Campbell it is Steve Alexander we are the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast these are our problems not theirs um all right where the hell were we oh huge shy relief with Rudy go bare last night as well 11 and 14 with two blocks he's got the the sternum thing the rib thing that's been bugging him um so that was good to see hey let's talk about Houston and Oklahoma City last night a gosh bleeping barn burner doc what a freaking game that was man that shot making um Jalen green sword again you want to talk about League winner Jalen green League winner right oh my God 3710 and 737 107 he had a local line last night was 73 balls and he was super clutch and over time um so no SGA last night right guys don't worry he's got a thigh thing it's not like a patella or anything like that it's a tie Bruce he needed a night off it was the second of a back-to-back um j-dub did more 235 and 10 but this was the Josh giddey story like Josh giddey showed us that he's still a good player man he made a shot from his ass last night he made a behind the back move fell down scrambled to get the ball and so we wouldn't travel just through it up from like eight feet out sitting in the lane and it went in um he had 317 and 4 one block one steal and Doc you remember the conversations we had about giddy at the beginning of the year it was like oh my God are we cutting him and sending him to waivers what are we doing here so I found that to be a very interesting game last night I said Joe popped off the bench um with SGA Outlast last night talk to me about that one of what you saw from a fantasy perspective  well Josh giddey getting 20 shots up is is what it's all about because he's he's not a very good shooter and he's not really that great of scoring normally Jaylen took three more shots but that's what's going to happen when SGA is out of the way and out of lineup like Gideon's gonna have to play point guard and scoring point guard and man he was awesome and uh you're Jalen green  take like Jalen green  well we were down on him at the beginning of year two because he wasn't doing that much but he is taking off over the last two months and he is winning people fantasy basketball leagues I love to see it I love the fact that Houston Houston's trying to track down  the Golden State Warriors and knock them out of the playoffs correct and did they do it are they there are they tied I haven't looked oh last I checked they were last I checked they were a game back in and Golden State yeah it's one game separating them so here's the lay of the land with that okay so you also Rick you should be mad at Chet Holm we're in more than you should be mad at Rich Sean Holmes Ron's got hurt shit homegrown fouled out in 18 minutes and scored two points in the midst of fantasy playoffs when people need him most that is a choke job that is not an injury and that is that is Chet letting his people down  I agree with all of that but guess what um he was probably really good in the previous games he's going to be really good over the weekend and Rashawn Holmes gave us three rebounds three that's all the game gave us now one block you didn't even hit a field goalie give us three rebounds last night he played 12 minutes he played the whole first half  just saying just to me Rashad holes you're dead to me oh  break down the Houston uh let's break down the Houston and Golden State race  because it's awesome just just quickly it is awesome the  the Houston Rockets have won 10 games in a row 10 I this is this might be the longest winning streak of the entire year by any team okay there haven't really been a lot of oh my God winning streaks this year they're having um they're one game behind Golden State okay and here's what's fun Golden State won the head tie breaker two nothing is the series lead they play one more time next Thursday in Houston yeah Houston can't win the tiebreaker but obviously they still have one more game it's a mess around with I like the way the Rockets are playing more than the way the Warriors are playing right now it's in Houston where they are docked are you sitting down 26 and 11 they're a fantastic home team Houston's problem doc because they're so young and stuff they they suck on the road they're 11 and 24 on the road but they won last night at Oklahoma City yes they took advantage of SGA being output I give them full credit but that that that's what I'm that's what I'm geeked about basketball right now is gold estate in Houston dude because the way the top of the West stock I don't damn know the top three Denver OKC in Minnesota you spent a bottle one of them will be one and two and three and then you got that whole Clippers Pelicans Maverick son's King's cluster that's fun right but they're all going to be in their somewhere no one of these teams is going home the Warriors or the Rockets what up the Warriors did not make the play in tournament doc what if well and and you know they talk about Karma a lot in  this world that we live in and Draymond Green is out there doing more Draymond Green crab every night it's creeping back in you know he took somebody down by the by the net yesterday's he's punching people pull the daily you know the week before and just what are you talking about what what are these incidents the Warriors what are you talking about he punched somebody what what are you talking about  well remember he went after Gilbert the other day and they started a whole brawl and  not really a brawl but coaches are falling down you know what I'm talking about I just more game was that dream on green crap was that was that a message game you know that Taylor Jenkins fell down that was that whole thing right yeah yeah I might yeah get him out there that's when he pushed he grabbed Santee all down his collar at the other end and pulled all that and it came down he was pushing him and but anyway it Draymond Green is doing more crap and I think he pulled somebody down and everybody's everybody wants to catch them I think and how fun would it be it would make Houston's year if they knocked the Warriors out of the playoffs and you know that's why they won ten in a row like they are like let's finish this we don't have I'll be sending goon we don't need him let's go get him well Jalen green is saying um I'm still the guy on this team y'all think that I'll be shining and I'll be shengwen is the guy on that team this explosion for Jalen has not been a coincidence it is literally happened since alpi left the lineup but it's cool to see I want to shout out a couple of guys from the Lakers and Memphis game last night doc we mentioned Brandon Clark not that you should be hot on picking him up but the return of Brandon Clarke is a good sign because Memphis isn't shutting their guys down all so he's gonna eat into Santi aldama in GG Jackson a little bit so just be aware of that Brandon Clark's playing time is going to rise he's going to pack man those guys a little bit and if Vince Williams can get back in the lineup then its going to be very different um I think I think he still just GG still gonna get tons of minutes so because it just it they have no reason not to play they got 359 yeah I disagree with that I don't think he's going to be playing 35 and out with Brandon Clark back I think it's gonna be more in the 20s um I'm not saying drop them I'm just saying be aware that that there may be a little bit of a haircut so me and Doc look at that one a little bit differently um Jake La Rabia all right he's a guy that would Brandon Clark coming back you know and then so last night with Clark's return Arabia's like oh my God my minutes are in Jeopardy here and he popped best game of his life 25 points um seven three balls made seven of nine and I love Bolivia's performance because the Lakers were on the verge of a blow up larvae started popping threes and it brought all of the Lakers starters back into the game for the fourth quarter so Jake laravia thank you because LeBron did a whole bunch of stuff in the fourth quarter after he came back out and ended up with a triple double in the game um well radio on waivers like maybe but the return of Brandon Clark to me is is going to be in his way and then DACA shout out to rui hachimura I got some stats for you on rui Hajj as I like to a call him he went 32 and 10 last night with seven bombs okay and that was against me uh was so frustrating watching him I'm just like really you are killing me not Softly You're killing me harshly right now over the last month 17 points a game five rebounds 1.73 he's not good with the with the blocks in the Steels we get it at this point check out let's go to reality for a minute check out the Lakers with rui hachimura this year Doc is it turns out he is the whole key to their puzzle all right he has started 30 games this year they're 20 and 10 they're playing six six seven ball with rui Hajj in their starting five that would be fourth in the west dock over the whole season four in the west it's there it's really simple math if ad or Lebron are not playing you want rui hachimura in your lineup  that's it simple math he's right about that um so they put him in the starting lineup 23 games ago they are 16 and 7 in those 23 games I'm just saying man people you want to shovel dirt on the Lakers and I'm not a Laker fan but you want to shovel dirt on the Lakers they're done they're kaput they're washed they're not going to do anything in the playoffs I am telling you to eat those words right now before you say something dumb because they're one of the best clutch teams in the NBA and and they've got Reeves and Russell and rui and Davis and bronze and now you got in what do you off the bench they got Firepower man and they've got experience and they've got obviously LeBron and David uh that probably the most accomplished duo in the NBA not the best to all the other clothes I'm just saying don't don't realize the Lakers here all right document with a couple of revives from last night man take me into song I'm Gonna I'm gonna throw some Austin reads why we're dealing with the Lakers right now the last time he scored in single digits with a 9-point game on February 5th last three games 11 assists 10 assists eight assists  it is balling like we were like people were down on Austin's like where is the Austin Reeves that I drafted he's right here he's been here since early February baller he's been awesome where is my list of stuff that I had to talk about let's let's see if we can find it the Llano Banton how much do I love this kid the Silly Season how do you count the ways do you have Banton in 30 Deep by the way I do not  I do not I only made one and then I dropped him doc I had him and I know no no no  are you serious yeah I dropped him when he sucked like he he played and then Chauncey Billups like yeah no I mean yo-yo him back deep in the rotation and like I said I need I needed to squat on guys and I didn't I I you know oh this guy's in the rotation out and I would go to the like Lily Pad hopping which is a very good formula in a lot of leaks but I found that not to be a good formula in 30 deep this year  Well Delano bands had 31 points last night he's been money for two months I'm calling him the fantasy Silly Season hero like he might be the silly season MVP because he's been balling for he's been doing it for almost two months had some ups and downs in there but he's been incredible my guy cam Thomas last night 38 points nice stat line he's back he's playing I need him to play for my 30 Team league and Rick is Jordan Poole gonna go out with a bang or a whimper he had 38 last night or is Jordan Poole gonna finally start playing like we thought he was going to on opening night let me let me go into Jordan Poole I do not roster him in any of my League's and I mean obviously pretty obviously so let me look at Jordan Poole right here  yeah he has but come on basketball ref work with me here uh let's see here blah blah blah blah I don't know doc I'm still seeing a mixed bag Gary popped last night he gets Brooklyn Brooklyn sucks um he had 23 the game before at Chicago that was a win by the way yeah that was that one caught my eye I watched that game he had a double-double the game before with 18 and 12 um but then the two games before that were Jordan Poole games he had 14 with not a lot and he had 13 with not a lot um I think he's on a mini heater here to be on with you and he did not shoot plus 50% in the previous two games for the raw stats were good so we had a pop game against a bad team and it went to overtime you played 45 minutes which is a major uptick in time for him now I think I think the next game he might have seven points on two of 20 so I'm not feeling you know a late season surge here um doc I will say this like if he is going to have a surge it would be now because now the pressure is up die it's Silly Season nobody's watching you can just go out there and ball a little bit but me and Antonio Daniels on NBA Radio yesterday talked about players who have turned us off this season and I got three for you doc first of all Joelle embiid for not playing against yokich in Denver for five straight years I am out on Joel embiid I am no longer a nurturer and apologist a supporter I'm out you do you Joel I'm gonna stand over here now lamelo ball who you mentioned the shutdown I mean I'm out I'm out like the guy is a myth okay him and his bro Lonzo are myths the ball family is a myth okay when are you ever going to play dude and then Jordan pulled doc I said infamously and incredulously on NBA Radio last year to the Chagrin and the heavy criticism and pushback from Antonio Daniels the Jordan Poole in the right scenario bad team first or second option  green light will average 25 points a game  that did not go well for me doctorate that did not go well for me at all because guess what he got traded to the exact spot that I said he needed to go to bad team first or second option 25 a game and what is Jordan Poole averaging this year Doc and that exact scenario and say 17 16 17 points stock 17  April Jackson  8 his starting job  I also made a horrible Jordan Poole prediction at the start of the season when my buddy Noah Rubin and I got together for a podcast and we  we had a little company we got to pick who we thought was gonna leave the league in blocks and I took wimby  and then we got the big Who's Gonna lead the league in assists and I took  Luca and he took tie however burden and then he was like Who's Gonna Leave the league in scoring he took Luca  I think Jordan cool and I feel stupid  wow oh  guys  you're welcome for these admissions okay our credibility I believe doc at this point is so established that we can admit these arrows right here we don't get all of these right we get I think most of them right but wow so you and I mean so so I'm done we got bamboo we both got Bamboozled by Jordan Poole we did and we're both out on Jordan Poole for the rest of our lives yeah you I'm good I don't know doctor I'm good I'm not going back okay so Rick you're you're holding to see Nirvana for Jordan Poole literally you cannot draw up a better scenario for a guy and he is pooped it down his leg  um  so so I had to put together a list of my top 12 players for next year from my buddy Adam King and I sent it off late last night I really wasn't I didn't really study it I didn't put a ton of time into it but here are my top 12 here's my first round for next year and I didn't know I was gonna do this but you talking about Joe Ellen beading me an out on him got me thinking like what I take Joe Ellen beat in the first round and any draft next year I I I'm out  I think I'm out here's my here's my list Victor women number one  Nicola yokich 2  SGA three  Luca 4  the Manassa bonus five maybe high tide Halliburton six Jana seven  Steph eight  eighty nine  Jaron Jackson Jr 10 Aunt Edwards 11 and I'll be Sheng Yoon 12 and that's just thrown together off the top of my head last night at 2 in the morning  um yeah probably miss I'm probably missing a guy or two um I mean I I'd have to look at  ah I don't Moss feels high I'll just say that right now I'm I'm a domas but I'm not a huge Dome off guy because doc why why am I not out of here just there's no gold there son  no threes no blocks no steals no no fantasy gold but I love them but not double doubles in the triple double doubles I mean it's amazing it's amazing he doc he is having the most historic non All-Star season ever ever he's got the all-time record for consecutive double-doubles I shouldn't say all the time it's not all-time since the merger he's got the record for consecutive double-doubles by the way I think it's 55 Will Chamberlain is in heaven laughing at all of us and doma's laughing hahaha He had 227 consecutive double-double that I forgot I forgot Kawhi Leonard by the way  that is a record that will not be broken no and isn't even a record though they why is there all this oh you know in the stat era of the NBA but for that one for some reason is there but it is it recorded somewhere and is it on a piece of paper that he's holding in a in a photo somewhere  oh  I don't know where to go with that I don't know where to go with that I just stopped the top Kevin Durant stands out to me is a guy that I would have in the top 12 okay what Jayson Tatum and I don't know where Tatum would be in there somewhere yes uh JJJ feel so high in the first round to me um it but the rest of the guys like I made you know tweak the order a little bit but no I'm the two guys that stand out like I don't know I may be able to find somebody else at the end of the first round that I like more than Shen goon but I'm not that mad at that because he really the box score loves him but he's caught he's a look in the pre drop process icon to Dumont to sabonis okay I got Vibes of dough Moss watching alpie play in a weird looking uniform and Europe before he was drafted okay and guess what he's literally domus maybe domas light but he doesn't hit three she doesn't block shots and he doesn't get steals so that would be a hang up for me I would I would doubt that right now if I did my top 12 that I would have Dolmas JJJ or Sheng in my um first round I'm thinking like maybe a a Durant a Tatum a Booker might be going in there are you coming around on Kawhi Leonard after how he is  stuck it out this year and he's second round not first round um and I I think I might still go and beat in the first round doctor I mean the numbers are so gargantuan man and he gives threes any blocks any does some Steals and on the assist right in the nickname her system we haven't seen Joel embiid assist like he did this year he was at five a game he was going 36 12 and 5 bro 36 12 and 5 you know many times that's that Lines been done  I think it's like him and Wilt like all time in history the league Joel embiid had more points than minutes played this year bro  and I get the injury risk I'm just I I think  indeed and B I still look at him as a first round pick man I do not not like I'm not taking them over Luka or SGA or um I would not take them over Yannis either doc I wouldn't and I know that the honest isn't great in the three ball category but I trust you on us is not missing gaps of Seasons you know what I'm saying um yeah I would I would take Anthony Davis over him I would take Anthony Davis over and be I like this new Anthony Davis stock and you know I sniffed it out right beginning of the year this is why you're all that you guys Davis is going to be Nails this year he is going to try to shut everybody up and play games and blah blah blah and that is happening um and you are I mean how about his stat line dude 25 12 3 2 1/2 like one and a half um you know the three balls evaporated the percentages are good like they I and I don't think Davis is going to revert back to half man half a season mode I I really think that he's like he had doc he won the championship and he checked out bro  that's my Bible Anthony Davis write all the Miss games and he wasn't in great shape and he's dragging dead legs through seasons and now I think he's like all right screw this like I'm 30 now I've got to go I got to add more chips here so I see a different Davis and I think this is going to be the new Davis here  do you want to answer some questions from man let's go to the streets  Matt carving says I heard you saw your interview with Dan I was on with Dan bessemer's yesterday and it's easy to find on Twitter and Dan and I are the ones playing in the finals so he's one know how my how our matchups going I am up five four in the middle of week one of a three week duel to the deaths though hanging in there we're up five four  hopefully if everybody keeps playing that's where it'll end up a defense says I'm in my semis very tough games against them one seed  dropping Grayson Allen after Friday game the stream or games does that make sense  without seeing the schedule without having studied Grace and I I'm I would assume you know what you're doing great now on his right there for fantasy surprise star of the entire year  he was probably the lowest drafted guy that had the best season  in fantasy in my mind this year so be careful if you're dropping Grayson Allen but  I mean if you've studied the schedule and that's what you need to do you got to do it if you're gonna make this move go get Sam Houser of Boston Sam Houser has two games left and Sam Houser has games we talked about this at the top of the Pod um  this cluster of players for the 14th that are playing tonight and Saturday Boston at Atlanta Milwaukee New Orleans those should be the targeted teams on the waiver wire right now because filling your lineup on Friday and Sunday is going to be a piece of cake um Grayson Allen obviously had the mega game the 32 with the 93 cents 13 points in three threes eight points no threes six points no threes last night 13 points in three threes so when Beale is healthy and Beale played through his finger injury last night hold up I got a stand up and take about  way to go Bradley Beal way to go he had the audacity he had the audacity last night to say on national TV at the halftime walk-off interview that he's a soldier he had the audacity the nerve the balls to say that he's a soldier  I almost went I almost fluted Denver to have a tough talk with Brad Beale no no no no no no no no no no no no dude you are one of these softest most pillow we saw Sherman saw players I've ever seen this guy the DN piece I made it rains the ATP with this guy oh you played through a finger injury the x-rays were negative there's no structural damage and so we're supposed to be out here applauding you my God  oh my God so anyway when Bradley Beal plays Grayson Allen doesn't eat a whole lot okay so the pickup from a man out here is Sam Houser and then doc  when Grayson has this game tomorrow and Sam has replaced Thursday and Saturday go pick up Sam Merrill go pick up another guy that gives you 10 to 15 points and two to three to four threes right those guys will be on waivers for you so I like the way atheists think uh our friend friend of the show can Crites the catering  how awesome is Delano band been silly season MVP I did not see that before I said that he posted before I said it perfect here's a serious question picked him up and cam Dynasty too I'm pissed at K train about that oh the catering and you are always throwing down and cam Dynasty  we're in the final four right now we're both in absolute meat grinders man who knows that's awesome  and he'll be on planet I'm not playing against him we may meet in the championship game  next week um but anyway go ahead Christian Rodgers says it's Charis Levert a drop now that Max strus is back here's the Levert has been rough over the last three games right he has and stress was on a minutes restriction last night he played well he had 19 points and how many bombs did my boy hit five bombs in 24 minutes that's going to go up Mitchell's coming back tomorrow Doc is what they're reporting he's expected to come back tomorrow and so you're going to have Garland Mobley Mitchell Allen streus that's your starting five and in Levert will be back to his 24 to 28 minute good game one night bad game the next um I mean it depends on who you're dropping Levert for but let me see if Levert has two more games but here's the thing Levert doc maybe a drop for one of these players that were talking about on the Thursday and Saturday because let me look here Levert plays tomorrow and Sunday so he does have two more games but again you're not gonna have a hard time feeling your lineup on Friday and Sunday so maybe optionality here is to drop Levert and go fill a hole on the Thursday and Saturday tough swing here  a deeper by the way already has Sam Houser so that was the initial then who would be that next three ball guy off waivers right it was did you say Najee or you said oh you know you tell me okay so who you picking up I'm gonna give you the three Ballers here that are out here not named Sam Houser for the Thursday Saturday deal uh Garrison Mathews vit Creech Pat connaughton Jae Crowder AJ Green Jose Alvarado najim Marshall  I like alright with no Brandon Ingram if overdose healthy and he's going to play I like all right okay let's say he doesn't play who's next because he might not play tonight  I know  and I'm intrigued by crunchy in the Hawks but I don't trust him enough to to put that kind of stock in him when I need somebody to come through might be Garrison  Garrison popped last night had 21 points in five threes but here's the problem with that doc one of my what's that tricky It's Tricky man here's probably that doctor  is Garrison Mathews doing that again tonight I don't know no the answer is no here's the answer is definitively know he is not going 21 points with five bombs again tonight that ain't happening oh by the way it's Boston's defense he's going up against okay you have that oh by the way Boston just gave up a 30-point lead at Atlanta okay you think they might be a little motivated tonight well fire it up to get back at your Hawks um so I'm gonna say Naji Marshall would be next he's playing about half the game right now with Ingram out they need his defense on the floor and here's the thing I love Naji Marshall if Jose Alvarado doesn't play tonight because that's going to mean even more playing time for Najee but I still like Najee if Jose plays but um I like Najee more than Jose I feel like I feel like nah gee is the most trustworthy guy on that list he had he had two pretty nice games um and then the last game he had I think it was 7 points four rebounds one assist one steal one three it was like not a great game  but the previous two were really good and he had a who are they playing that they were playing SGA the other night Dock and they had so you know how that goes sometimes we're just all focused on defense and not you was on SJ a lot um and so I think it's gonna open up for Najee I would rather have Najee than Jose if Jose even plays tonight I would still rather have notchy um  yeah yeah I I think Najee is the most consistent I think he's the safest but he also probably has the least  chance of like blowing up having that home run game but I don't know that you're looking for a home run game here you're looking for safe and somebody to get you a little bit of stuff right like now what we're Sean Holmes did to us last night was 0300000 okay like give us get all we need is 10 points five boards two assists one steel two threes that's all we're looking for here I feel like we've had three awesome Rick rants in this podcast today and we're gonna finish this off  with  you gonna finish it off with a little toy soldier commented you're cracking me up dude that's good that's good like I'm gonna fly to Denver and tell him that he is a toy soldier or wherever it was you oh yeah oh so the Spurs beat the Suns without wimby and then the Suns turn around and be Denver Denver just doesn't care right now right they're just like out nobody water waiting for the playoffs not at all not at all Doc they have the best record since that's um I don't know Boston One Night in a row before that game the other nights every night every night who's a team that's bored um who's a team that's kind of bored out there at the top I don't know I don't I don't think any of them are bored doc I think they're all going for seating in that kind of thing um check it out Denver um they're only losses since the All-Star break it was an overtime game it was the Kyrie Irving left-handed hook shot at the buzzer and it was last night at home without Jamal Murray and Jamal Murray literally doc was the reason they lost that game um they they just needed that one more score and they didn't have it um and you had obviously Booker and Durant doing big things um so they know I didn't Denver's locked in dude I'm not detecting any kind of slippage from them  all right  catering in Christ and I will be here on Tuesday to do this all over again Rick and I will be back next Thursday we should have a much better feeling for where all of us stand in all of our playoff stuff we'll know a hell of a lot more about where our brackets are how they're looking we're gonna have Rick we'll hopefully set his baseball lineup before the middle of our show next week so he's not trying to figure out what time baseball season starts today in the middle of a basketball podcast I know you guys hate baseball and only care about basketball I'm here to get Hoops news I need fantasy information right now shut up about your baseball team but we're coming back and this is a fun show Rick I love you the show yeah me too man I love you Doc and all you guys out here really appreciate you joining us and
