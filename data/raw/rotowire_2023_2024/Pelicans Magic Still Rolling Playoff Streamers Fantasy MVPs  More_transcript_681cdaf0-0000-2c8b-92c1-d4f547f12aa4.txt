right Brandon you know I you flashed me or your bracket just before we started recording you did you use any AI technology to fill that out um I can't say that I did but I would assume that it would actually work out better than what I had put together yeah um that's you know it's it's always sort of  smoking mirrors the way that you come up with this stuff every year but I've been pretty consistent strategy with how I develop a bracket I'm sure that we can we can get into that at some point on today's episode  yes absolutely we will you know luckily we don't have a ton of major news you know it feels like the last couple weeks every week we've done this pod it's been like well another major player is out for the year didn't have a ton of that last night we could talk a little bit about what we saw your Orlando Magic were in action and just complete decimation of the Charlotte Hornets Brandon I was I was all over Wendell Carter Points Plus rebounds and Franz Wagner Points Plus assists last night both those guys played well the only played 20 more minutes because or Lando  excuse me LED this game 67 to 32 at the half  yeah it was gonna take quite the lack of effort in the third quarter that the Hornets did win by the way the Hornets out scored the Magic by nine in the third quarter and but I mean the magic would have had to completely fallen asleep at the wheel they couldn't miss last night Cole Anthony it took him like three quarters to miss a shot pallos making crazy passes all night while he was out there I was also on his Points Plus assist that was one of the prize picks that I handed out via RotoWire yesterday and you know I got some Flack for this yeah this is the way that it works I don't care if I if I hit I'll brag about it if I don't you control me you're not gonna hurt my feelings but there there was someone that said oh you know pallo they hit me up and said well hello choked like that's not at all what happened not all stat lines are created equal he didn't come close to getting to over 27 and a half which is what I thought he would get going in it wasn't because he couldn't get there it was because the coach wouldn't let him get there he didn't play in the fourth quarter because they didn't need him I was actually hoping at one point that Charlotte would make this  a game let's see let's get the starters back out there it's get some urgency there was none of that saw a lot of Admiral Scofield and Caleb Houston last night that is the the human white flag that coach Mosley will waive for his opponents yeah I mean the magic they played everybody I think literally everybody who is eligible to play last night got into this game they played 15 guys according to the box score that I'm looking at so good for them you know Orlando continues to play well they are a half game out now of the four seed in the Eastern Conference they're they're only two and a half behind Cleveland which will you know Miss Donovan Mitchell for a couple more games at least for the three seat which is it's conceivable Brandon and I still you know I don't know if this team finishing third fourth fifth sixth wherever I don't know if that ultimately changes how I feel about their postseason ceiling but you know getting a home playoff series for a team that is not had anything close to that in a very long time would be massive you know tomorrow night they have a really fun game against the New Orleans Pelicans they played the Pelicans twice over the next couple of weeks New Orleans is as hot as anybody right now they have taken advantage of a relatively soft schedule but I mean they're beating up on teams man their top five and net rating the defense has been significantly better there's a report over the weekend that Zion is apparently lost 25 pounds since hell season tournament yeah I mean he had a huge dunk last night I think it was now Jimmy martial who kind of threw an ally you but I mean it looked it looked like Old Zion right it was kind of design that we thought we'd see more frequently in the NBA Pals win easily last night this was another semi blowout situation I was very concerned about my Zion over 30 and a half points plus rebounds for some reason they put him back in late when they were like up 17 and you know he's able to tack on a few more there but this is a game that New Orleans controlled from start to finish basically felt like it was over at halftime and you know they're now 10 and 4 since the All-Star break and you know I'm pretty good shape here to avoid any concerns about falling into the and Zone none ironically enough one of the only teams in the league with a better record than them since the All-Star break is the Orlando Magic so you kind of have this yeah feels like like a mini Super Bowl of up-and-coming young talented teams that's going on it's like a lion's Texans matchup you know it kind of is exactly you go weren't these these teams have been bad for a really long time but I sense that something is changing curious to see how the magic stack up with them love what I'm seeing from the Pelicans right now and we kind of knew this in order for them to hit their upside Zion had to become some version of what you expected coming out of Duke and I would say that what the guy that he is right now is exactly that this is what you thought you were going to get if there were those that were hyping him up like he was going to be the next LeBron anybody who knows what they're talking about wasn't framing it that way he's got a big star power  quality about him where maybe he can become marketable in that sort of way he's not that sort of player much more in line with like a Charles Barkley but hell if you turn into Charles Barkley these one of the top 50 players all time so you're still talking about one of the greatest that ever laced them up not the second greatest that ever laced them up so I think that there was some overhyping that went on with Zion but for the folks that watched him at Duke and kind of understood what he could bring to an NBA game that version of Zion is exactly what we're getting right now it's making for some really entertaining basketball and I can't wait to see them in the arena tomorrow night my concern with the magic  is that they've been great since the All-Star break there's 17 and 5 in their last 22 games they have been beating up on bad competition they had one of the toughest schedules in the league leading up to the all-star break since then it has been a cakewalk now Nick you know all you can do is take care of the schedule in front of you and they're obliterating some of these teams right  so how do they stack up since the All-Star break they've played 17 at above 500 they're three and four in those games so something to consider yeah that was something we talked about coming out of the break right was at Orlando had by far the easiest remaining schedule in the NBA they have knocked out a lot of those games already they're they now as of today have the 12th hardest schedule in the NBA going forward they still played Milwaukee twice they got the Clippers twice they put the pals twice the Kings the Sixers technically you know count as a tough opponent right now but we'll see do you have Joel Aviv is there for that game and all likelihood he won't be and then they still have a few cupcakes as well you know I was I was all over that Jamal Mosley to one to win coach of the year coming out of the break I don't know if we're gonna get there he's down to 30 to 1 at DraftKings he's 20 to one at bet MGM and 21 to one at FanDuel but Mark daigneault started to pull away a little bit here he's separating himself you know from Missoula and Chris Finch is actually falling behind Joe Missoula in the odds Jones was not winning this award it's just it's not gonna happen I really don't see that being the case I know Boston's running away with the Easter Conference number one season but this that would not feel right I don't think people are going to vote  for him but dang notes almost minus 400 now at DK I I don't really know why you can't give Joe mazzulla the credit that he deserves the Boston Celtics are hovering around 80% win rate if you look at the history of the NBA the teams that have been in that range there's some of the greatest teams in the history of the NBA so I don't think that we should Breeze past him as quickly I am also obviously in the camp of Jamal Mosley needs to be in this discussion but the problem with with Mosley is that you can't say Jamal Mosley should be the coach of the year and then not then just turn around and give it to Mark dag and all because what he's doing is pretty much exactly what Jamal Mosley's doing just at a better level so if you're going to give it to one you kind of have to give it to the guy that's winning more games my only case for Mosley overdag and all it would be the injury situation I think the Oklahoma City Thunder have been pretty healthy squad over the course of the Year yes he has not had to deal with a lot of lineup  management jamahl Mosley that's not necessarily the case certainly not the case for JB Bickerstaff and Cleveland so some of these other coaches that have done what about Tom Thibodeau and all the injuries the Knicks have had to overcome so if you're going to give coaches credit for that then that that's my only knock against dag and all that he's he's had an easy road but he's got young guys that he has as the number one seed in the Western Conference so I can only poked so many holes he probably should win the award I you know I'm ultimately fine with it I I just I think Jamal Mosley more so embodies the spirit of what this award is and we'll see maybe you know if they finish strong here and Orlando gets the three seed in the East I don't think this is completely decided yet but no you are right on Missoula you know typically you know I'm just looking at the last 15 years or so here in terms of who's won coach of the year you know Monty Williams wanted for the sons a few years ago and they won 64 games but won it for a 60 win Bucks team obviously Steve Kerr when the Warriors 173 like that when you're far away the best team in your conference and in the NBA and you have the best record by several games that often does lead to coach of the year it's just you know every time you talk to somebody or you read somebody who covers the Celtics it's like they're still criticizing Joe Missoula like it feels like they're winning in spite of Missoula the way that people talk about it so I just don't think the narrative is there in the way that it typically is for a team that's this good but you're going to be in the mix by default when you have that many wins great Point by you on OKC by the way I looked this up the other day  for the roadwire NBA show which you can conveniently here on NBA Radio 7730 PM Eastern tonight  the Thunder of lost 11 total games in their starting lineup 11 SGA has missed One game chat homegrown is Miss zero games Jalen Williams is responsible for seven of those 11 Lou Doris missed two in giddy as missed one I mean that's as healthy as you could possibly be this is like Sacramento Kings stuff  exactly so and that's where I'm a little bit hesitant to buy all the way in come playoff time because they might be the Sacramento Kings of this year where they just rip through the regular season they look like they've taken this huge leap then all the sudden they have to play in a phone booth and they're not nearly as impressive I think consistency availability these sort of things and wanting it you know they're a young team that doesn't know any better I'm experiencing that with the magic they don't the reason why they blow bad teams out is because they don't take anybody lightly good teams know better I don't need to give Max effort against the Hornets I'll wait until two nights from now when I'm playing against the sons you know and teams like the Thunder and the magic don't think like that because they this is their first taste of winning so they're addicted to it so you know you're getting some of that what does that look like come playoff time but in terms of Coach of the Year kind of hard to look away from what okay see has done and they deserves some sort of recognition doesn't look like SGA is going to win the MVP but I like him to at least to at least put his best foot forward to trying to win that award so that's why one of the picks tonight by the way over 31 and a half points for Shea Gill just Alexander against the atrocious atrocious Utah Jazz defense just hope that he blow out doesn't come too early in that one well that's the thing we need we need Utah to keep this someone respectable and as of as of the the stream right now we know for sure market ends out we know Clarkson's out I would guess John Collins probably doesn't play Just for safety purposes after what happened to him earlier this week he is questionable right now but did not did not have a concussion thankfully but dealing with still some I think some PTSD it might be the first ever questionable PTSD designation in NBA history but if they don't have him and I mean yeah you got Walker but they don't love playing him big minutes anyway I think that one could get a little bit out of hand but nonetheless I mean SGA you know getting to somewhere between 30 and 34 points every single night has been a pretty safe bet I was  you know I was looking at that game as you know do we  do we trust OKC to cover you know I gotta look at what the lines at right now but late last night when I was looking into it it was at 14 okay she's been pretty good in these spots like Sacramento for example that was looking this up the other day they're double-digit favorites tonight at Toronto I believe the kings are one in seven ATS as a double-digit favorite this season like you just stay away they went into overtime with Memphis the other night as a double-digit favorite like that's that's one that I just stay away from okay see nine and seven ATS this season as a double-digit favorite and that line is now up to 15 as we speak Utah has been pretty frisky but almost exclusively at home they are 10 17 and 1 as a road dog this season that's against the spread and they're 22 and 13 ATS at home okay see 19 and 10 ATS as a home favorite so a lot of the trends would point to this being you know a potential blowout situation for the Thunder yeah it's it's okay see or nothing for me with there's no way I would lay my money on Utah especially with all of the the injuries and uncertainty with their lineup but I can't play that once the line gets passed like 12 I'm out you have you have officially priced me out of the equation you just see too much goofiness at the end of games you know if and it can work in in a variety of ways either the game is closer than you expect and you kind of know going into the fourth quarter there's no way you're covering that number or the game gets so out of hand so early that you've got backups that are playing and all the sudden it becomes a g League game and you get a backdoor cover I would I would take OKC if I had to bet this game but as I often like to remind people you don't have to bet every game on the board I would stay away from OKC minus 15 and a half that's just your opinion it's my someone would say they do have to bet every game on the board you know you want  to you want to diversify as much as you can all right let's hit a couple of questions from the chat keep these coming in guys we'll hit them throughout the show Christian says good morning fellas good morning Christian I lost Giannis today for my playoff matchup points League brutal thoughts on Luke kornet to replace him for my Center Spot the only spot I have available to fill is Center okay well you know going from Beast to Luke Cornett you know we'll see if he could have a drop that's that production so Boston they've been kind of doing a rotation it feels like of kind of rest and you know load management over the last week or so my guess you know with a 10 game lead in the East is that continues down the stretch they don't have anybody officially ruled out for tonight yet but Drew holiday and Jalen Brown are both questionable Sam Houser tweaked his ankle the other night he's also questionable  you know it's it's not a back-to-back so we expect for zingus and Horford to be available that worries me a little bit as far as cornet goes but you know you're kind of backed into a corner here you need a center  you know cornette even in games when porzingis and Horford have been active he's still he's still been solid right I mean I think in this situation he kind of have to go in expecting the worst which you know could be two points one rebound want to assist like he had against Phoenix the other night it could be 14 points and six rebounds just if this does turn into a blowout in favor of Boston with no Yana's maybe get some production out of him in the second half but I think the other side of this Brandon would be looking at tonight's late and assuming you have the option to maybe swap in somebody else who might be available and his Center eligible would there be anybody else out there you know I was going to say Taylor Hendricks comes to mind as somebody who could step up for Utah I don't think he's Center eligible in most leaks he's probably probably forward only you know Kelly Olynyk is still floating out there which you probably isn't you know that could be a good spot  yeah it's it's tough man I mean you could you could try to snatch up one of the Portland guys  but they play the Clippers I wouldn't say that's a good matchup like you might you might just kind of have to eat this one I mean there's really no replacing on us even if it's just one game of course not I mean the good thing about Luke kornet is that you know at least in terms of his point total he is pretty consistent over the last couple of weeks where he is gonna give you a good outing after a bad outing he had four points in his last game so then if I'm following the recent trends of Luke cornette he's good for double-digit points he did have 10 rebounds in that last game but you know in terms of just a full stat sheet which is what you were getting from The Greek Freak who was Irreplaceable he had 14 and 6 12 and 2 14 then four so it's a little bit of a sea salt and the sea salt May spring in your direction here tonight yeah I mean again I will caution that Boston's been without you know feels like one to three of their key guys every night over the last couple of weeks so you know there is a little bit of noise and in that sample but something to keep an eye on their the other the other thing to monitor throughout the day is again assuming you can make this move at some point before tip-off is bam is now questionable for Miami tonight you know so if he were if he were to sit out you know it could be it could be a Thomas Bryant night because Kevin Love is already out yo bitch is also questionable so I would I would you know kind of see how the news develops throughout the day and maybe a you know a better streaming option A Rises but you know as you've got a black here you're like we scrape at the bottom of the barrel Matt says what's up guys would you drop herb Jones for any of the following players on waivers  Walker Kessler Taylor Hendricks TJ McConnell Malik Beasley and C Martin that could be Cody or Kayla I'm gonna assume it's Caleb had to head points League Matt is in the quarterfinals of his playoffs so would you drop herb Jones for any of those guys  hmm I do like TJ McConnell he's pretty consistent as it comes for what you're looking for here in terms of a replacement I feel like herb Jones a lot of his value in terms of on the basketball court comes with what he does on defense how much of that translates to what you need in fantasy I think I like McConnell a little bit more but those would be my favorite too of the list that you have here so if you're sort of waffling on it I would just hang on to Herb Jones  yeah I mean the points league is what makes it a little tougher because you know so much of herbs value is derived defensively and yeah those that still gets you points in a point sleep but it's not as singularly valuable you're kind of just looking for  total fantasy points of course  Hendricks to me is a little bit interesting I think you're still gonna have to live with the down games you know like yeah that disaster game against Atlanta where you just one of seven from the field so give you 10 boards like the rebound and floor for him I think it's gonna continue to be pretty high he's been blocking shots lately  depends what happens with with marketing you know did I kind of thought three days ago that he was maybe shut down for the year and then he comes back now he's out again like chances are he probably misses what at least half of their games the rest of the way and if that's the case I think there is going to be some opportunity here for Taylor Hendricks when it comes to Malik Beasley in a points League not that excited about him you know it's really just points in threes for him and again much like herb Jones you know those threes are helping you a lot more when they're helping you win a single category instead of just contributing to total fantasy points and then Matt has clarified that it is in fact Caleb Martin  I like Caleb Martin for tonight specialty of Jimmy Butler doesn't play going forward you know somebody who has a relatively low ceiling but as played a lot better of late you know you look at the last 10 games for Caleb Martin 13 points five and a half rebounds two assists and almost two combined  Steals and blocks per game so he's on average probably giving you similar if not slightly better production than herb Jones so a lot to get there your final answer is just hold on to her  yeah I mean I think it's close enough to where I'm not making a move unless I feel like I have to and I love the way this Pelicans team is playing right now he's part of the reason why so let's press forward with the guy on the team that's on a heater right now all right  all right mister a knot doctor a mister a says do I drop optia and Tobias Harris to get in on streamers like Banton Beach maybe Jaden ivy interesting question here yeah I mean Washington  I mean they're they're down bad we know that and now they're dealing with injuries that may or may not be real obvious to third straight game yesterday they play again tomorrow get Sacramento they play Saturday against Toronto you know if you're looking at the schedule they only have they only have one more back-to-back I'm not really sure that even matters that this point I think they're just kind of trying to get a look at the Patrick Baldwin's and the Johnny Davis's of the world Davis was horrendous last night in his first start of the Year by the way so yeah the obvious ride maybe over I think he's he's kind of in like a marketing situation to me  I you know getting a chance to see me such live last night in person he looked like the best player on the floor for the Charlotte Hornets at least the most consistent I love what I see from Brandon Miller but he's still got a lot of room to grow but it doesn't look like lamelo is coming back anytime soon I don't even know if he's coming back at all so yeah I mean I don't think he's coming back man I know we've talked about this for like two months now so it just feels like we're beating a dead horse but I mean Charlotte has what 13 games left I mean do we really expect him to pull a Desmond beIN here I just don't so I saw him last night warming up on the court and all he was doing was shooting free throws it just doesn't look like somebody you know I've seen this where you you can see in the pre-game when teams try and ramp guys up to action I did not get that vibe from watching lamelo ball out on the floor last night before last night's game tipped off I like the way message plays I think you should definitely add him drop of Diaz Tobias Harris I'm a little bit more hesitant on because I like what he's giving you he can go off any night and in terms of scoring and he's probably the most consistent rebounder on the team right now so I'm not looking to move off of him for those other options yeah I think Harris just deal with the legit injury and like Philly you know Philly is in a complete opposite situation like the Wizards have the worst record in the NBA they're all but locked in to a you know top four lottery odds pick here whereas Philly Phillies a half game up on Indy to avoid the plate you know  and they're one game up on Miami like they really have to talk to play for like to buy shares was healthy he would be playing so I'm a lot more worried about Avia and the Wizards you know taking it easy with him that I would be to buy his Harris in the Sixers so yeah I think if you're gonna drop one of them to me but it would have to be obvious Paul says week 22 Trey man or Jalen Suggs I just dropped sucks for Trey man because I have a bye week this week but Suggs stats yesterday are making me regret that move  what did I tell you guys I told you guys this on the podcast last week you know what I talked Magic Basketball I've got it on lock over here okay watch this team every night you don't drop Jalen Suggs before an eight game home stand that was a bad idea this is his time to shine they've got another week ahead of this so yes I think Jalen Suggs is the answer he's a completely different player inside the walls of that building so much swag so much enthusiasm he gets the crowd going and he feeds off of that when he goes on the road well he's he's a he is a different kind of guy but at home definitely someone that can fill up the stat sheet okay well let me ask you this we're talking next week so the week that starts Monday was that the 25th if my math is correct here  or Orlando plays three games Charlotte plays four games  does that change the calculus  I don't think it does I'm not convinced that tree man is going to give you the the sort of consistency like what he gave you last night the that's just not good enough like he's got a score in order to be valuable because he's not gonna light up the the defensive stats like you're gonna get from Jalen Jones he's at he's at 1.7 steals per game since he became a starter you know I mean he's he's he's had multiple steals in like three quarters of these games he's not giving me anything in terms of blocks of course right but he's giving you assist he's rebounds really well for a size you're right that the scoring upside isn't really there but I think he could make the same case for Subs like I say this I'll just agree I think if it were me and I have the option to start one of the other I'm just gonna go with the four game guy oh so you're right I mean you look back at some of these last few games he had four steals just the other night he's had a pair and most of the games that he's played so probably unfair to criticize him on that I still think that you're getting with with Suggs on a team that is now utilizing him as a starting point guard is just it provides a little bit more stability and I think more upside and it's three-point shooting has been phenomenal that is not the case for Trey man who's shooting 20% over his last 10 games Jalen Suggs has got his up to 40% this year from three point range so I I just I liked songs a little bit more right now the four games spread that you talked about you know it makes me hesitate a little bit I like Trey man but they've got other guys that they want to give looks to on that team too I'm just not over the moon with what I saw from this guy last night so perhaps I'm a little bit sour because of recency bias  all right good question from Andrew he says I'm in a bit of a pickle pickle okay you come to the right place I'm in here for the voice league and I'm up on my opponent by 175 I want to make sure I'm in a position to win is Miles bridges droppable for a streamer spot this week so I assume we're looking at the rest of this week if you're in a daily moves league so let me let me pull up the old schedule here for the remainder of the week Charlotte is Charlotte's a two game team this week so they've already played their one of their two games that was last night against Orlando off Wednesday off Thursday off Friday they play at Atlanta on Saturdays so  yeah I mean you're in a good spot here you're up big but you know still relatively early in the week  I think you know if you're in the finals  if this is it then yes absolutely I would worry about dropping him and then regretting not having him for a four game week next week but if you're just worried about you know kind of padding your lead for this week then absolutely because I think you have you have a ton of options as far as guys who play three more games the rest of this week right I mean there's like 10 to 15 teams that that play you know some combination of Wednesday Thursday Friday Sunday so you know you're not just looking at like oh two or three teams that I have to choose from like you should be able to find you know somebody decent you're not gonna find anybody who's miles Bridges caliber of course but you know three games of a significantly lesser player still going to be better than one of Myles Bridges so my initial answer would be depends if you want them or need them for next week  I'm not throwing him back out on the Waiver Wires so I mean it's definitely something you could do if you're trying to win this match up but I also saw this same individual Andrew followed up and said it's just around one you've got more rounds to win here so I'm not getting rid of what would we be one of my best fantasy assets just so I can further pad a matchup that it looks like you're good anyway I don't think it's worth the risk okay yeah and and like you said it is just round one so it's it's tough I mean it you know a two-game week in the fantasy playoffs it's just brutal but you know if you were if you were down 175 then maybe I would say yeah sure yeah just to win this matchup survive in advance deal with it later but yeah if you're up by 175 like you should hopefully be able to ride it out because you're gonna want him for those four games next week Matt says would you drop Nas Reed for trayce Jackson Davis and a points League he's in his finals in this league and he used one of his four ads on NAS Reed on Monday so would you drop in for trayce Jackson Davis look at the schedule for Minnesota they are in a four game week but they've already played two of their four games they play Friday against Cleveland not a great matchup and then Sunday against Golden State meanwhile the Warriors play three more games so they play Memphis tonight Indy on Friday Minnesota on Sunday  and I think it comes down to exactly that one of the reasons why I would think in and we don't know this but the Timberwolves the played a lot of games in not a lot of days I would not be surprised if they gave a break to a couple of their bigs in the loud Nas read a little bit more room to run so he could end up and we don't know that that's going to happen so that sort of thought process could backfire but Trace checks and Davis feels like the right move here but I also wouldn't be surprised if nazri had a really strong finish to the week what you're part of it depends on gobert you know obviously not read as kind of gone off these last few games with towns out and you know when Compares out it just becomes super obvious and if go Bears back you know you're looking at a lower ceiling for him so yeah it's it's the two games versus three games debate and if you're in the finals this week you know you don't really have to worry about anything after that I think yeah I think I take the three games out of trayce Jackson Davis last five games for him by the way 12 and a half points seven and a half boards two and a half assists and 1.8 blocks so you know nazre definitely has more night tonight upside but I the difference between these guys lately has it been massive so I would take the extra game with trayce Jackson Davis  let's see here what else do we have well Matt also said he's worried that nazri might not play it all that is true you know he's dealing with a head injury was questionable did not play last night so that's that that you know if you're still waffling on it that probably breaks the tie not knowing his status right now all right The Nomad says who should I pick up of this list Chris Paul Keon Ellis  or Payton Pritchard  boy that's a who's who right there the fantasy stardom um your hall of famers no doubt I think one of them might make it  Payton Pritchard know I think I would I think I would go the Payton Pritchard route and I like that they it looks like they have an easier Road tonight against the Milwaukee Bucks so that should be  the kind of game where maybe gets more run I'm not blown away by the other two  yeah I mean key on Ellis I think it's on this list because of what he's done defensively lately I mean he had five blocks again it's the other night but that is a team that if you listen to the Rodeway NBA show and NBA Radio you know the Grizzlies get blocked all the time we're always targeting those those props he's been getting a lot of steals as well but that's kind of like he's not giving you Elite defensive production it's gonna be pretty shaky and if we're talking rest of the week he has Sacramento does play three more games  so does Golden State you know and so does Boston assuming Pritchard plays it all those so schedule doesn't necessarily come into play here I  if you could if you could guarantee me that like you know Drew holiday or Derek white or Jaylen Brown you know Miss at least one or two games the rest of the week which they very well could I think Richard would make some sense here but my default is still Chris Paul I think he's gonna give you the highest floor if that's what you're looking for yeah I mean this Golden State team is you know they're starting to find their stride a little bit and having Chris ball back and active part of the rotation is certainly helped in that regard just looking at what he's been able to produce as of late a last game 14 points for assists for rebounds a steel you know that that's kind of what you're getting from Chris Paul right now but that's kind of what you're gonna get from all these guys so it's it's it's a crappy Baskin-Robbins I'm gonna go with Pete and Pritchard  okay there we have flavor  all right Christopher says do you have any insight on Giannis is the serious are they resting him back to back pulling my hair out there's blood there's blood from Christopher I don't have any here because of Giannis  well I'll tell you this so it is a back-to-back and it's a it's a road home back to back so they play at Boston tonight their home for Brooklyn tomorrow I will be in the house for that one by the way Brandon wow advantage of some suspiciously cheap tickets like Bucks tickets yeah they're not hard to come by but they're expensive like it's night and day you used to be able to go to a Bucks game in college we would drive from Madison pay five bucks to go see the Bucks you know take on the Wizards or whoever it was it's it's pricey now to get into fiser Forum but hold on you're telling me Nick Whalen of rotowire.com cannot get into this building for free I I can and I have but I'm going with some friends you know I can't I can't get everybody all right media access but you know I want to go it's gonna go as a civilian sometimes these games and not be mobbed by everybody you know to not have to like go take the underground tunnel to get in you just you know that goes um but tickets are super cheap on Thursday partially I think because it's the Nets and it's like you know nobody cares and number two because at the NCAA tournament I think everybody wants to be home watching that so I'm hoping you honest plays on Thursday I don't think it's overly serious I mean  I'm a little surprised that he like he didn't even make the trip to Boston I saw a tweet late last night at Bucs Twitter he was spotted at a Milwaukee movie theater with his with one of his kids last night so he's up and he's moving around you know he looked fine he was in his usual Nike you know Tech fit sweat suit that he seems to be wearing at all times my guess is they're just being extra cautious here with the hamstring obviously he had the Achilles thing you know a couple of weeks ago not totally out of the question that he could play Thursday but that's all a game that Milwaukee could probably win without him and they you know they have a homestand coming up here three games so my guess is he's probably back Sunday against okay see  brutal for Fantasy but wouldn't really worry about it too much long term all right a couple more here know what we'll talk about some yahoo MVPs on the year and then get your your final NCAA tournament thoughts before we bounce out of here can I ask you a quick question about the Milwaukee Bucks before we move on do you think that it's possible that they don't care if they have the two or the three seed that they look at the Eastern Conference and go what the hell is the difference with all these teams well I think the only difference would be when you play Boston right I think you want the two in theory so that's the Eastern Conference Finals matchup right but if it's at I don't think they're pushing for it at the expense of honest as health yeah yeah but it just feels like they're the two seed I don't think they're gonna go out of their way to knock at the two seed up there's only so many games left like if you want it go get it you know and Now's the Time to take advantage so it does feel like they're letting their foot off the gas a little bit but anyway move on perhaps all right no Matt says should we drop Duncan Robinson he's been ruled out tonight with a back injury I mean hard to say how much time he misses I don't really want to speculate too much there they play Friday and Sunday so he's got two more opportunities to play they do only have a three game week next week I mean he's been playing really well he's giving you you know high volume threes as you'd expect he does other injuries so that's how  I you know if you're just looking at like the rest of this week and you're in a daily moves League  knowing that he's out tonight already and knowing that they're all these other three game options  yeah I'm probably okay with that you know what he's not a miles Bridges caliber Guy where you're like gonna regret not having him next week because I have a three game week exactly you know the type of stat line that Miles Bridges is giving you cannot be replaced on the waiver wire Duncan Robinson is the exact stat line that you can replace on the waiver wire so the second you feel like you need to swap a position out like that that type of player I've got no issue doing it I don't think you're gonna miss out because of it all right last one quickly azer I think I'm pronouncing that correctly hopefully it says any insights on Drew and Jalen  unfortunately no they're they're both questionable like we said earlier Boston has been doing this kind of rolling rotation where it feels like one or two of their top seven guys are out every single night I think I mean they're up 10 games in the East I think they're just trying to build in some load management here but you know this you know tonight is a TV game so I do wonder if they're you know is there any like are they allowed to sit multiple guys like that I'm not really sure I think they could get away with  with sitting Drew in jail I don't think they could sit Jalen and and Tatum tonight but now I know idea what to expect here I would expect one of them to not play at least just because that's how Boston's handled it over the last couple of weeks but we don't we don't have any Insider info there he's good teams they get so squirrely and I have you seen anybody has anybody been penalized yet for that new rule you can't say that I know guys on TV and that's honestly it's a good thing that that is not come up all year I remember when that when that first came out here like oh my God the Clippers are gonna be screw the Lakers it's like just hasn't been a problem like that there's been some other issues with this NBA season you know the scoring obviously got out of hand for a while and now that's under control but you know healthwise load management wise it just really hasn't been an issue I think it has but I think we're so used to it at this point and everybody knew that this was never actually going to be a rule that went into effect and the way that they laid it out it's not just two players that are good on your roster it's two All-Stars or all NBA guys and even the best teams don't have that you know that that's a that's a lot of High Caliber talent to have on your roster so I think that some teams have been able to skirt by because we go well he's not we wasn't on All Star so those are well this is a good segue to talk about the MVPs of the season I just dropped the link in the in the chat here Yahoo has a great page they do this for for football and baseball as well I love looking at this it's the the players who are most frequently rostered on the 500 best public league teams on Yahoo and number two on that list Brandon would not have expected this Kawhi Leonard is on 23.4% of the 500 best fantasy basketball teams on Yahoo this seasonally because he is just not missed that much time on surprisingly SGA we said earlier I believe it's missed one game on the year he's at almost 30% which is crazy high Derek white 22% check homegrown 19% yolk hitch Jalen Johnson Brooke Lopez miles Bridges a little bit surprising and Tobias Harris those are your top 10 fantasy MVPs again those are the players most frequently rostered on the best fantasy basketball teams any of those jump out to you for one reason or another Derek white jumps out to me because he's been living on the top of that list all season long so credit to you out there if you got Derek white because this is not a new this is this is not a new revelation for us Kawhi Leonard certainly does stand out because I think it's pretty I like the ones that are obvious to me are the ones that stand out why is there inherent value across fantasy rosters across the country in the world well that's because Kawhi Leonard is one of the top players in the NBA yet you all got him on a discount because nobody expected him to be available as much as he's been available so now that he has been he's at the top of that list SGA I mean you look for a full stat sheet and fantasy basketball there's nobody that delivers that quite like quite like she'll just Alexander does I'm surprised by Miles Bridges and Tobias Harris I  that's where like some of them are obvious you go okay that makes perfect sense and I can find the correlation I don't know what the correlation of Harrison Bridges is I I think what you have to remember with Bridges is there was a suspension right and there's all this like coming into the year like he's even gonna play is even gonna be on the roster so you know a lot of this is  where do you rank Now versus your ADP and you know keep in mind like you can you can have Derek white on your team and if you you know if you drafted terribly around him it doesn't matter you're not going to clock in as one of the top 500 teams but you know it's a huge Advantage you know you get Derek white I'm looking at his ADP right now in Yahoo League's he was going on average with the 84th pick he is currently the 17th best fantasy player in nine category League this year total value so you know not missing time is maybe the biggest factor of all here and Miles Bridges you know comes in quite a bit lower like you said it doesn't feel like he's having some sort of All Time season but he's just 60th ranked player in terms of total value and you know he was going in like the 120s in a lot of leaves so he still made a huge jump in terms of value versus ADP same thing with Jael Johnson no surprise to see him on this list and you know not only is Chet homegrown the fourth you know most valuable by this metric fantasy player but Jalen Williams is also in the top 15 so you know another guy who's beat his P by pretty good margin partially because he's missed almost no time so not a surprise to me to see three OKC guys in the top 15 you know and there's a strategy to take from that because they were a team that I think people expected to improve but they've taken a bigger leap than the consensus thought so if you if you buy into a team and that preseason process and say they're gonna go from bad to really good or from good to best in their conference load up on those players I don't think it's a coincidence that you have multiple players from that same team that have that are at the top of an MVP list like this one thing that does surprise me your guy who you are confident will be your number one next year where is Victor Windham oh he's in the 40s overall fantasy  MV what the so I want to try and word this properly yeah it's tough to work it's not overall fantasy value it is the the the percentage of rosters that are that are winning  he's the success right  I am not nailing this right now but you get what I'm trying to say Victor woman 10% of winning rosters in fantasy basketball it's a lot lower than I would thought would have thought is that just because we were sort of overdrafting him but yet it's not an overdraft because he's delivered and then some so I'm a little bit confused as well how he fell so far down the list I thought the same thing and I was going to bring that up as well I mean I guess the argument is that he was going in the second round if not higher in most drafts so like yeah he ranks sixth right now in terms of total value in Nyan Cat but in Yahoo leaves he was going pick 23rd so he's you know he's beating his ADP he's having an insane year but he's not beating it by 60 spots in the same way that Miles Bridges is right you know he's beating it by like 15 spots which is still nice but there's you know there's less wiggle room I think when you're taking somebody inside the first two rounds but you know just the advantage the advantage that gives you defensively and you know a lot of Yahoo leaves are points league so maybe that mitigates it a little bit as well but yeah I was surprised to see him so far down the list Jalen Duren you know he's had almost 12% to sue moose at almost 12% that makes sense James Harden you know ranks fairly High you kind of forget how late he was going you know if you were doing a draft right before the season started I mean this feels like years ago now where we're like it's even gonna play this series you're gonna sit out you got a pretty good value on James Harden if you  took him in the 50s and a couple weeks Daniel gaffords on the list don't take even chenzo's on the list that all makes sense Tice Jones as well I mean you forget how bad ties Jones was the first month of the Season we were all panicking he turned out to be just fine but yeah go check out that page we LinkedIn in the chat really interesting stuff I would like to see like a Yahoo lvps you know it's like who are who are the guys free roster on the 500 worst teams I could come up with the list I know Jordan Poole would be on it Jordan Poole scoot Henderson who else we got shade on Sharp yeah I could come up with an lvp list yeah well I'm looking at 80 piece stuff now you know based on Yahoo it's like who not that many first round first and second round picks ended up being like total bus you know lamelo Ball's got to be up there alright hello for sure yeah 12 but yeah I mean even MB it's like yeah obviously you've been backtracking on and beat for the last month plus but he was so so good early on that I don't think you look back and regret that you know call Bridges was going really high in Underdog basketballs he was going oftentimes early second round yeah that's kind of disaster yeah just yeah but people were all excited about him I think hallow been Caroll probably a little bit over drafted he's been he's been to a good it's it's the real life to Fantasy translation that doesn't always not always a seamless fit I don't think he's been great for the fantasy aspect of things and yeah I mean those are some of  the names that really stand out are there any Rockets guys because we're kind of in jail and green Maybe yeah I I do think he's like killing you yeah I mean he was going like in the 80s in Yahoo leagues right now he ranks 1:15 so yeah it hasn't been as a better positive Roi but it hasn't been like a complete disaster and he's starting to make a little bit of hay here all right before we get out here I want to do this quickly yep NCAA tournament talk I know you're you're a jack of all trades you're involved in the NCAA tournament as much as you are any other sport I'm very nervous for Wisconsin have to play 31 win James Madison team on Friday I am glad that we got the like latest possible time slot 8:40 p.m. central tip off that's exactly what we want the boys are going to be getting together we're gonna be at the bar it's gonna be fun what what team do you attach yourself to for this tournament are there any any Regents your particularly keeping an eye on and he upsets that you like yeah I know what we'll talk more about this on on XM later today but just want to get your your general thoughts and you know just anything you want to say about the NCAA tournament before we out yeah I you I think you can't be too narrow-minded in your approach to filling out a bracket you you want you want teams that are hot going in you also don't want teams that have peaked too soon so trying to sort of find that balance and so for me I've done that with a couple what really my national championship matchup if I can kind of fast forward to the end is Auburn I love the way that they played in the SEC tournament I was on Florida plus the points in that SEC Championship game and I learned a little something about what Bruce Pearl's team is made of that is a team that is built to compete in the NCAA tournament and if you look at their Ken Palm ringing if you look at their defensive stats over the course of the season they kind of tracked like kind of like UConn did last year a four seed that all the sudden became a force and powered their way through the issue is for them and it would also be the issue for UConn is that the East is is so tough to make it out of but that and it's hard to win back-to-back championships which is why I booted Yukon out we haven't seen that since the Gators did it in 2007 the other side of the equation for me is Houston who is the opposite end of the spectrum they deliver on all of the metrics that you want defensive rating Ken Palm yada they've been one of the best teams in the country all year they got smacked in their conference Championship game I kind of like that I like that they got their loss out of the way so it's two different sort of philosophies and thinking about how these teams make it through but I think you have to get a little bit wacky in order to fill out your bracket and in terms of upsets I do have GMU beating with constant it's my favorite 12 over 5 you have to pick one it's an annual tradition unlike any other I think Charleston makes it past Alabama but my biggest Cinderella this year is McNeese State coached by Will Wade out of the South  you got if you have not taken the time to do this go and watch this team's highlights they can be like dunk City this year they go up against Gonzaga who is a little overseeded in that first round then they would probably get a beat up Kansas without mccullar I like them to get and then they would get Purdue and Purdue always fail so it was like as I was making the bracket I'm like I just keep pushing this little Cinderella through but that's how it happens that's my turnip breakdown it's funny that you say McNeese State because that that's how they've always been to us right but it's now just McNeese apparently they're just going by McNeese they've drawn it's true yeah yeah but like you know growing up they were always making these State yeah they're like the random team you would try to take to a national title on college hoops 2K 5 I think they might even bet in some of the the NCAA football video games when they included the the then one double A teams all the thing I like to keep an eye on of course in the NCAA tournament is NBA Draft implications  it's just not a great tournament for that it's really not you know what we'll have a few guys who will go in the lottery it's like the Kentucky guys reached Shepherd Rob Dillingham specifically they could both be top five to seven picks like Cody Williams for Colorado they need to play their way into the tournament they play Boise State tonight Jacoby Walter keep an eye on him from Baylor obviously Stephon Castle from from UConn clinging connect guys like that you know could be late lottery mid first round but it's a very strange draft right now like if you most box that you look at if you follow this stuff  a lot of international talent coming in this year a lot of G League type of guys I mean we could have you know five of the first seven picks could be either International or League guys and obviously it could be more depending on on how this draft develops over the next few few months here so there's just not there's not our usual like you know we're watching Zion Williamson RJ Barrett campus where these guys all gonna go like they're a handful of names to monitor but for NBA purposes for Fantasy Basketball purposes this is not not a stellar tournament day in terms of NBA Talent no and I think for any Talent evaluator they would tell you that they'd barely pay attention to the tournament I don't think they want to get punched drunk on anybody or sell stock on somebody that they felt really good about because they had a bad tournament just look at Andrew Wiggins I think I still remember his four-point outing for Kansas years ago but where I do think there can be some movement is in the late teens in the 20s said definitely in the second round I'm curious to see if as good as Zach Eddie has been we have not seen him make a real run now that he's been the guy for Purdue  I'm and he's he's somebody that could go second round late first  if they're able to push through this tournament the way that they should be able to give in their seating and all the hype around them is he somebody that with a dominant performance through multiple games on a big stage actually pushes himself into that conversation of a late first round pick that would be one of the big story lines that I would follow but yeah as far as the top of the draft there's there's just not a lot to really wrap your arms around so fell out of bracket make your bets and and we'll enjoy it for those reasons all right looking forward to it as always been one of the best sports weekends Bar None and I don't care how much you were locked in on college basketball this is the best this is the best weekend of the year to have the multi TV setup so don't don't let anybody tell you whether it's your wife your friends any
