welcome to a Wednesday Edition the Roto came and say it Brandon World 2 seconds into the pot the RotoWire fantasy basketball pod this is this is what happens when we recorded early in the morning here in Central Time and the temperature drops 50 degrees overnight as it did here in Milwaukee I was I was on the golf course yesterday afternoon I had a great time it was 73 degrees I woke up this morning and there's a windshield freezing advisory like we literally lost 50 degrees overnight so I am a little bit disoriented to hear you off to forgive me before we get into some of the topics we want to hit today we had a huge Tuesday night in the NBA an uncharacteristically large Tuesday night so we'll talk about some of the takeaways there any injury news any player news we have going into a smaller slate Wednesday want to talk to Victor WebMD Yamaha as far as where he's gonna go in Vegas he drafts next year we'll talk about some of the risers and fallers in terms of season long value but first and foremost Brandon you're doing surprise picks content for us over at RotoWire so I want to encourage everybody right away to check that out you can find each video on our RotoWire NBA Twitter account find it on the RotoWire Twitter account I retweet it Brandon retweets it you throw it up on tiktok Instagram we know prize picks is you this time of year when a lot of people are dropping out of their season long leagues loosen some interest so make sure you check out Rhode Island picks and Brandon is just gonna give you free money every night on Twitter it sounds like well that's the hope I will tell you I'm putting my all into this okay I'm not just throwing picks together haphazardly so and I'm taking the ride with you anything that I hand out I'll put my own money on it that way if you lose I lose too so that's my that's my personal guarantee and I so the picks have been okay the first couple of days that we've done this but in terms of the Harley action that goes into a prize pick you got to hit both that has not yet happened in the first two days gone one and one in the first two picks in the pick Series so not awful but not good enough I had a sar Thompson over five and a half rebounds on Monday he had four I had I owed to Sumo to hit just two threes all he had to do he was oh for five from three point range a stat line that he is not produced in ages now so just got to get some of that reverse bounce look in my favor but the and I'm not just saying this because we are on a RotoWire pod cast but the RotoWire I I start at the base of the RotoWire picks and props tool on the website it is invaluable just to see the the weighted hit rate so there's what I gravitate to first and foremost and then I back my research out from that but it's a great place to start to get an idea of  How likely is this to happen and then let's see if there are reasons that I can back that up on a night like last night where you have 11 games and you're looking at the board on prize picks and it's over yeah I have no idea where to start here there's somebody options for each player this at least you know it's not it's not just gonna say hey here are the locks of the night that will never lose but it's going to point you in the right direction we expect you however Brandon to be hitting 100% so I'm gonna get things turned around here I mean obviously any any looser is unacceptable I had a rough night out prize picks too last night I went  went ham as they say and through a bunch of entries one of my worst picks of the Year Derek white over two and a half threes as like this is the night you know they're gonna go crazy Phillies been terrible on defense Boston they take more than any team in the league last night they just decided not to do that and instead win the game a different way Derek white extremely quiet night for him he didn't really do anything the big hits for me I hate to rub this in brain and I went I would assume who over four assists he had six oh man which is amazing because the Bulls went two of 29 from 3 and barely made any shots the entire night so I think every made field goal was actually at assist four I had to Sumo we were really threatening the needle there I went back on Zion pra you know we're seeing points ion right now with CJ McCollum out of the lineup the assist Productions been up he had a nice night and then we went pretty big on Jayla Johnson as well that was my best bet on our road to wire betting article yesterday over 17 and a half points we took the over on 27 and a half points plus rebounds and I mean that's just a dream matchup Atlanta Utah right now might be the most fantasy friendly matchup possible and really by by that game standards it wasn't even that high scoring Utah only got to 97  yeah and well actually one of the reasons that I led me to a pick for tonight if we're gonna project forward to talk about Point Zion and and they're on the second item of a back-to-back Zion has been putting a big numbers but he's also been turning the ball over a lot this is not a natural sort of position for him going up against a Pacers team when you're guest you don't really want to go up against the Pacers in Indiana so I'm thinking Tyrese halliburton's gonna have a field day Steals and blocks so that was one of the over one and a half feels like the lock of the century tonight  I I like Albert tonight a lot I mean he's coming off of You could argue like his worst game of the year against Toronto the other night he just doesn't really have games like that anymore right I mean he's at that level you know where it feels like you know an off game for him is like 15 points in Tennessee yeah 9 points two of 11 shooting one of six from three really has a shot the ball well coming out of the break what's the weather so I think this should be a pretty good bounce back spot for him tonight we got a question about Jaron Jackson in the chat Brandon and I want to hit that right away it's extra pressure and I don't know if you're aware I traded Jared Jackson I finally rid myself you did I flipped him straight up for Albertsons I love that  I it was it was something that I had to do all right given that my category needs given the fact that I think you might be shut down and I have a feeling that's where this question may be going so Christian says I was offered a trade for Jaron Jackson and Jabari Smith should I accept I've already lost embiid and he follows up and says I was offered Anthony Davis for those two players so ad for Jaren Jackson and Jabari Smith 12 team category League again he's already lost and bead so he is worried about Anthony Davis's Health as well  I think I would just take the deal if you've lost him bead you know you're probably you're probably doing okay because indeed was so dominant for you know the first basically two thirds of the Season that you know you you're likely staying afloat and you're looking to find a way to compensate for that if this is a league that goes all the way through game 82 yeah maybe you get some impede back for a week or two at the end of the season that would be huge  obviously there are concerns about Anthony Davis their concerns for me about Jaron Jackson being shut down and then I'd like to always Smith but the Rockets are kind of back to having too many guys he had again I think there's too much upside here with Anthony Davis and I know you're always waiting on the injury he's taking time off and hasn't happened yet but you know unless you're you're still somehow sitting in first place here and you could kind of ride this out and run out the clock if you if you feel like you need to make a move to move up I think this is a pretty good option yeah and this could be  you know this could come back to bite me in the in the back side here but Anthony Davis has actually been a pretty clean bill of health this year so this could be one of those Seasons yeah it's I'm sure that this will change in a moment and gave him the old broadcaster Jenks right there but I I like the deal you're getting the best player involved in the trade and you're trying to supplement what you've lost in Joel embiid my question to you is as I've seen this bantered about among fantasy basketball players out there are you dropping Joel embiid based on the latest report where he's not gonna come back until we're probably looking at like mid-march I mean at that point you're already deep into the fantasy playoffs is it even worth it it to me it totally depends on your league format like if your league ends with you know some leaks and like before April even or you know first week in April in that situation I guess I would drop him you know it I think the thing is if you can if you could just like make the playoffs in a head-to-head league and then you get it back for the playoffs you know that's a lot different than trying to you know climb from Seventh to First in a category league right so I think it had to head League especially if you have an IR spot or multiple IR spots I would be terrified to drop him just in case because like even if you just get that one week like if you can if you can make it through the first round of the playoffs you're in the final four and then that beat comes back your team is completely different right that is big of a boost as you could possibly get and yeah you could say there might be a ramp up period for a beat I get that but even like a limited even if a beat plays like 25 minutes you still gonna be like a top 12 start right so I answer would be yeah unless your season ends earlier than average or even you know I you know if it ends the first week in April I would hold on to him I would I think there's there's too much upside here we're not talking about a guy who's like maybe giving you top 75 production we're talking about like Far and Away the best fantasy player in the league right yeah even if you get that even if you get it for one game honestly it's it's worth it so depends on how shallow your benches what your team's looking like right now and like Nick said I think the most important thing is when does your league actually end that date is going to factor in a lot but it's something that I know people are are thinking about now I wonder if Christian here is already made that movie didn't really say whether or not indeed is still on his roster  yeah it's again very dependent on what your league settings are I want to talk about a few things from last night we mentioned the the December curse we won't bring that up anymore you know there's an article yesterday and ESPN about the the NBA competition committee which I believe is is held by Joe Dumars you know talking about ways to to kind of  give advantages back to the defense you know maybe the pendulum is swung too far and favor of the offense and this is this is the debate that comes up one way or the other like every 10 to 20 years right I mean in the mid-2000s it was all right defenses is overwhelming you know this is not fun to watch we need to find ways to open things up for the offense they eliminate the hand check rule things like that now we've gone too far but last night was a normally low scoring night across the NBA write 81 points for Brooklyn 97 for Utah 99 for Philly the team I really want to talk about the Charlotte Hornets my goodness they got to 85 you see that like 123.85 yeah maybe that's what we expect bucks are the better team  brand of the Charlotte Hornets had 26 points at halftime 26 that is the lowest scoring half obviously of the NBA season by eight points the Portland Trail Blazers had 34 the other night I think that was Sunday and in a loss and I was making fun of the Blazers on the pod on Monday for that I apologize I did not see this coming 26 first half points for Charlotte absolutely pathetic yeah this it's a really bad basketball team and I think at this point in the year you're what you're seeing of the teams that are cratering out offensively are the teams that we have no expectations for to begin with you get to this point in the season and I think you get past the All-Star break these teams just look and go how quickly can we wrap this up I think there are a number of these teams the Hornets included in this that just want to get to the finish line here and so you're going to have more of these type of games I think it's a more of a reason to look at a team that's favored by double digits in the NBA don't be scared off by that on certain situations because I think you're going to see these teams cover at a more alarming rate then we've even seen in the past is all so helps in terms of betting unders because if you have one team that's scoring 85 rarely is an over being hit for the overall game and so not exactly a surprise that we're seeing that from teams  like the Hornets the Blazers I saw it happen at the Kia Center the artist formerly known as the Amway Center last night against the Brooklyn Nets another one of those teams that just in the season end uh the next to me you know Alex and I talked about this on the roadwire MBA Show on Sirius XM NBA  you know we try to give out a best bet for for each game and you know try to at least give one out for each team you know especially on a smaller slate whenever the Nets are featured like we just it's so hard to come up with anything man like there's what do you do there's nobody on this team who's Dependable night tonight like I thought McCall Bridges would be one of the safest highest for Fantasy guys you know betting guys in the  no they lose cam Thomas earlier this week that's a hit for for scoring obviously and in fantasy and you know I thought last night was actually maybe a decent spot for them you're catching Orlando without Pollo vancaro and you still get blown out in that fashion I mean yeah Orlando only put up 108 right I mean they're not a high scoring team necessarily but it's not like Orlando played that well I mean they didn't shoot it well from three they did have a big night at the line I got to the lines 25 times but Brooklyn's just the box score the box score for that game is a little bit misleading because a lot of those things really cratered out for the magic at the end of the game they didn't need to play anybody in the fourth quarter so you you had the you had the end of the bench guys out there that really that tanked those percentages but I talked about this on the postgame show last night really if you want to judge the game you had to look at the end of the third quarter box score and the magic was shooting 58% from the field 39% from 3-point range at that point in the game that was more indicative of the type of game that they were playing but yeah but it came down to the defense and the fact that Mikhail bridge is just couldn't make anything I thought the magic did a good job putting their hand in his face but still this is a guy last time they played last time the Nets played the magic you drop up to 42 and usually kills this team the Nets have two wins over the magic already this year both of them are are by 20 or more so I think there was a situationally you're right no pallo being Cairo Jonathan Isaac is out coming back off of a road trip is always a tough spot for teams but there's nothing quite as invigorating for an NBA team is the Revenge Factor when you've been blown out by another team these professionals are Petty they remember that stuff and and I think they were waiting to kind of give it back to the Nets and the Nets aren't very good to begin with  I do want to go back to that Milwaukee Charlotte game and I have nothing else to say about the Hornets so you know kind of disappointed in trade man who was really fired up to to grab offers he actually played okay and he gave you 16 for three and two last night one of those guys that I think might end up being kind of a sneaky League winner in some formats but Damian Lillard you know he's been the subject of some degree of Iris specifically from me over the last couple of months here he's been disappointing you know you kind of expecting some more of those flashes and you know we talked about coming out of the break of do we see a different version of Damian Lillard not you know it's gonna parlay winning the Three-Point Contest and to be back but there didn't seem to be kind of a mental reset for him you know he's talked pretty openly about it on podcast we've heard Doc Rivers talked about it some of the changes that he's brought and Lillard to me looks more like himself right like there was a clip of Patrick Beverley I think it was on his own pod talking about the conversation he had with Lillard and for one they squashed their beef apparently they went out to dinner that's that's all well and good but it was more intriguing to me is that he told Damian Lillard like where the 35-foot right like that's that's kind of your bread and butter you and Steph you're the guys that shoot those he's like where's those bed you know and it kind of sounded like Dave didn't want to step on anybody's toes you want to come in and launch what might be viewed as a bad shot and that basically told him like Hey man that's your game you need to start doing that and if you're watching last night at Lillard had a couple of those three games now out of the break 23 points eight rebounds almost nine assists per game he's piling up steals he's in threes at 40% obviously it's a small sample you know two of those games came to get Charlotte and Philly which are the worst defenses in the NBA although recently Charlotte's defense of numbers actually look okay maybe not so much after last night but I really think there is a visual difference in the the version of Dame Lillard that we've seen just in these last three games  so are you telling me then that the All-Star game has woken him up no that would be a ridiculous talking point but here we are all star break the All-Star break as woke up whatever happened the actual All Star know I don't I don't think he picked up any confidence in the All-Star Game or the Three-Point Contest no I don't think that's the case if anything you normally see some guys struggle after participating in something like that it's like the whole Run Derby in baseball know I think I think we're starting to see the Doc Rivers impact as far as you know there's that other report you know that doc went player by player said this is what we need from you right and I don't think that was happening with Adrian Griffin I think there was some confusion especially among the role guys who are in the rotation one night out of the rotation of the other  I just really like how this box team is playing I'm not saying I'm picking them over Boston to win the East it's still think depth is going to be a big issue for them on the wing you know they didn't really go out and add that  that Wing Defender that we've been talking about all year that they need in fact they went the other way and added a little gal are you like maybe the worst Wing defender in the NBA so I I just feel better about Lillard overall you know I was I was trying to trade him frantically like before the All-Star break you know I was sending out offers left and right nobody wanted him maybe I was shooting a little bit too high but you know I actually kind of feel good about his fantasy prospects down the stretch  we all need a Pet Shop Beverly in our lives just somebody that reminds you that you are that guy like Sue back up and it's great to see because Damian Lillard is  at his best one of the best players in the NBA and this year he is a guy specially in the fantasy Community we have been like hands off on on Damian Lillard moving forward so if if he's able to keep this up and turn it around and do this against some of the top-level competition in the NBA then I think it shapes up for a really exciting postseason and for those that have hung on to Damian Lillard and having traded him away this is this is something that is paying dividends at the exact right time in the season for you  let's hit a few more questions and we'll talk some Victor webmin Yama free key a regular and the chat says yo is Draymond a 10 team nine cat guy he said I'm hunting three so I scooped him up somebody dropped him and I don't know if it's because they're trying to make the playoffs or what yeah I mean 10 Team league this becomes a little bit more of a debate but I think he's absolutely somebody that should be rostered right I mean you look at the season long numbers and he's like a borderline top 90 guy but since coming back from the suspension he's been a lot better you know still giving you dream on numbers right so you got to be realistic there's gonna be a lot of nights where he's got like four points but the rebounding has been better the assist you know he's giving you almost six assists per game since he came back about one block one steal one three so you know there's not going to be like with Draymond you never get the splash tonight right where it's like oh you went for 40 thank you know you just got to get that steady production every single game but yeah even in attend Team league if somebody dropped him I mean he absolutely should be roster maybe not starting him every single week but I think you're totally fine picking him up yeah I think pre-all-star break we saw him go for 23 against the Utah Jazz in a really high scoring game that's about as good as it's gonna get offensively and even that is asking for a lot based on what he does but the rebounding in the assists are going to be there and I and I think part of the reason we can feel better about Draymond is because we're starting to feel better about the Golden State Warriors this is a team that doesn't feel as dead as they once did they've been picking up wins by the case load recently so in dream on settled back in to his role and I think they found other guys to help keep the the freshness of this team of pajam ski and the way that commitment has been playing  and of course Steph is going to bring his but I think that I think this suspension served dream on well it seems like he's more Zen and kind of playing his brain to basketball more consistently yeah you never gonna look at a an 11 Point win on the road at Washington as like a huge Victory but I actually thought last night I mean that was a game they could have lost like Washington was watched it was hit in some threes you know Corey kiss per played well Landry gave them some good minutes Jordan Poole did not play well I mean they had 320 Point scorers in the starting lineup warriors were down Wiggins obviously you're still bringing clay Off the Bench a reintegrating Chris Paul and Steph Curry did not play well I mean at one point he was two of 12 from 3 ended up hitting a couple late to to help them seal that game but I was actually impressed by the way the Warriors battled by the night when shots really were not falling for their best player and it was another great night for John I think it 10 of 13 from the field 21.6 rebounds five assists you know not buying in on kaminga earlier in the season you know when you started to break out you know what stray mine was first suspended that's one of my biggest regrets yeah I kind of thought it was Fool's Gold and he's taking a big step forward he has and it I mean you just can't buy into everybody we see guys at that point in the season October you're still excited that you just drafted this roster you want to see all that plays out by the time you get to mid-november early December you know it's we get close to Christmas you end up in scramble mode because you're dealing with injuries or some guys just aren't coming through on your roster and then yeah there are guys on the waiver wire that you can't pick up everybody so you have to you have to be selective and you're going to have hits you gonna have misses Jonathan coming as one of those guys that if you're able to scoop him up early you're feeling pretty good about it how about Klay Thompson too his move to the bench seems to have reinvigorated his game too it's another reason why we can start to like this team a little bit more and Chris Paul is you know he's back with this team now too so all the sudden they've got depth a team that we  looked at his sort of top heavy and old  all the sudden they look deep and they've got guys everywhere I mean we got Dallas Golden State in the Lakers that all might be playing teams right now right I mean it's great the West the bottom of the West is so strong it's like poor Sacramento poor you know New Orleans if they end up as the seven I don't want to play any of those teams in a one game must win scenario and Golden State now has jumped ahead of the Lakers for the nine spots in the West Clay by the way 4.4 made threes per game at 45% since moving to the bench and that's with you know that stinker against the Lakers you know where he had just three points in 28 minutes so you take that out it looks even better a couple more questions Here Andrew says should I drop Paul Reed to pick up Royce O'Neill in a points lie  I I don't know if I would do that I mean Royston deals coming off of that  big game the other night that was arguably his best game of the season Paul Reed is coming off of an absolutely terrible game last night against Boston that's just a bad matchup for him only played 14 minutes that's what's a little more concerning is like despite Paul Reed being the very obvious replacement for Joel embiid the minutes still haven't been there every single night but I would be a little cautious of buying in hard on Royston Neil like this this reminds me of the Harrison Barnes you know like two game Breakout early this year where I foolishly rushed out to the waiver wire and he immediately reverted back to being here so bars yeah but that's the concern on the one Paul reads side is that we're all waiting for him to put up these numbers nothing like Joel embiid but just some level of consistency because of the opportunity that he's been given and it's not there I think I'd rather take my chance on on Royce O'Neill and just kind of see how it goes  prior to last night when Paul Reed was scoreless with three rebounds in 14 minutes last seven games 11 points 9 boards 1.4 blocks  again if you need three specifically you know then maybe I would lean Royston Neil but he also have to keep in mind that you know Phoenix was down multiple Wings there without Gordon and Beale the other night so that led to you know increase opportunity for Royston Neil that's not always going to be there I still lean Paul Reed it's going to be frustrating but you know neither these guys are ultimately you know every week starters necessarily Matt says would you prefer which of the two players would you prefer as a stash for the playoffs my apologies gradey dick or Taylor Hendricks so we got two kind of late Lottery rookies here this is a head-to-head Yahoo points lie with it being a points League Brandon I I think I would default  to Taylor Hendricks but I mean great dicks played well the thing is you know he's he's definitely more than a three-point shooter I think we saw that at Kansas you know a lot of people see him like oh he'll just be Kyle Korver and it's like I think he can do more long term but you know Alex made a good point on Monday he's like for the current context of the Raptors he kind of just is a 3-point shooter for them I mean what four for four against Indy the other night he was two for five and his previous game against Atlanta those are two cake matchups about as good of matchups as you're gonna find right now Hendricks to me is going to be a little bit more up and down I do think at a points League though I would still prefer Taylor Hendricks let's say you I tend to lean gradey dick I think he's just gonna be a bigger part of the offense so there's more more volume of available for gradey dick and ate but if you're looking for the defensive stats he's not going to give you really any of that and that'll be all Taylor Hendricks it's close but I tend to lean gradey dick I would favor the three-point shooting  Hendrix is averaging about two more fantasy points per game so far I mean small sample neither these guys have been in the rotation all that much this season so it's it is close to wash but again points like idling Hendrix you lean dick that's totally fair Mr Ray says do I drop Paul Reed for Nick Richards that's an interesting one the Richards had the huge game over the weekend 2110 3 and 2 6.7 boards last night against Milwaukee I mean really nobody played well for the Hornets you could kind of write that one off it I mean on aggregate Nick Richards has been better than Paul Reed there's really no debate about that so I would say yes like if you're in the camp that Mark Williams isn't coming back which Alex has been on this it's like early December I think he called he's like I don't think we see him again this year and it is starting to Trend that way so yeah I think I would drop Richard or I would drop Reed for Richards yeah I agree and I like some of the totals that we've seen recently as well he's been seven rebounds or more in every game that he is played dating back to the seventh of this month this month so you're getting that you get the blocks from him scored 21 points a couple nights back against Portland so it's it some of its gonna be match up base if you set your lineup for the week you don't really get to play that game but if the Hornets play and equally bad team or something close to it he should have himself a good game  what you're gonna have to deal with or nights where the team scores in the 80s apparently  yeah I know this might not be the last time that we see Charlotte you know struggling to get to 90 points good question on Daniel Gafford from Brian he says his Stafford to drop we have not talked about this yet Brian appreciate you jumping in on the Stream he's played 17 19 and 7 minutes over the last three games hasn't really been doing a whole lot I mean last night especially is concerning right the seven minutes in and you know Cleveland's the type of team that you think you'd see more Daniel Gafford right there the rare team that throws like true true big men out there so if he's only playing seven minutes with Jared Allen and Evan Mobley out there that to me is concerning you know late season when you don't really have as much time to to react and you know see how it goes over the next few weeks if there's somebody out there if you're in a tender 12 Team league I think he probably have to drop it right now right I think that we have to work with the information that we've been giving  it's not gonna kill you if you drop him but I do think it's a little Hasty these are three bad games the most concerning part is the minutes of all he's dip below 20 in his last three games and the production has dipped alongside that but this could also just be a three-game spell still getting acclimated to a new team you've got a factor that in as well if you have to make a move go ahead and do it but I don't think he's a must drop player buddy by any means  yeah maybe not must drop but if we if we have another game like that where he's you know under 10 minutes they play tonight at Toronto so we'll get our answer in short order you know that point he might be must drop yeah I mean there's just and I like what Dallas did to add depth in terms of real life but fantasy wise for Gafford for Washington for lively it's kind of a downgrade for all three by the way I'm sure you saw Max druze last night came in late you know they're they're trailing the Mavericks five for five from three including that 50 footer to win it in five minutes of action well when you're hot you're hot you  it's I think it's seven threes last night was that the number I believe so 736 that's the first time he's done that since the first game of the season it so the is not been the Marksman that they thought they were going to get but I feel like last night's game in the way that that ended with what was almost a three-quarter court shot to win the game that pays for the contract doesn't it that was Unreal I mean that the only thing that kind of reminded me of that is like we've seen Klay Thompson have some moments you know where he just gets hot I mean I think four of those three came out four consecutive possessions and then there was a bit of a gap before the the game winner obviously at the end I mean that was Unreal performance by Max serous who was you know in a bit of a shooting slump like you said coming into that game last eight games you shooting 23% from three and then he goes seven of ten last night let's talk to Victor Webb in Yama Brandon I mean there's no real news here like webinar at this point is just giving us like four to seven highlights per night I believe Monte Morris was the primary victim last day where I think he he thought he had weapon yava Baseline to kind of sneak one of those like no look layups and women literally just caught it with one hand and looked at him like what do you do in Monte Morris your 5:11 1713 54 and two for weapon Jama and what was a really tough matchup against Minnesota though they did not have Karl Anthony towns his like steals a blocks are borderline comical these days great like it's  minimum four and a half like he's at five and a half sometimes like that is insane nobody steals prop is five and a half but you understand why I mean last six games a specialty 5.3 blocks 2.7 steals per game he's giving you eight blocks plus deals per game and I know the 10 block game against Toronto is carrying some water there but this what this is leading me to Brandon is looking at Victor Webb in Jama season long despite being on a minutes limit despite I would say getting off to a relatively slow start compared to the weapon Yama that we've seen in the last month he is the number seven overall fantasy player in terms of per game value he's also stayed healthy right and you know this is something I think it was so low or Bill Simmons somebody brought up they're like  I kind of figured you would have more of these like porzingis type of injuries right where he's like on the ground he's falling awkwardly like that does not happen it's clear that this guy puts in the work on his balance and you know there's all the stuff made about like his foot strength and stuff like that I mean the fact that there's not even been like an injury scare all year for women I think he has to go down as a huge Victory because I think the numbers are maybe not that surprising because we had this level of talent but I thought there'd be a lot more like us second of a back-to-back we're holding them out you know he's gonna miss three games here we're being cautious like he's been a perfect bill of health I think relative to expectations the question is how high are you taking it would you consider him at number one over yolk or SGA and beat next season  I don't think I'm taking him over those guys but I think I'm taking him right after and I think over at bead I would take him over and be too I wouldn't take him over yokich I wouldn't take him over SGA I would start debating it around donshea that I think that's the that's around the range this is my biggest Victory lap of the entire season I was all in on Victor webinar of the fantasy asset I did not want to miss out on this I get a lot wrong this was not one of them so I'm I was pretty much all in I took him an hour our Vegas drafts he was my second pick and I had a I had a few people looking at me sideways when that happened and and now I mean I'm not second overall but second round pick I was in that crazy but yeah going into next year it's it's wheels up I'm thinking fourth overall third fourth overall sounds about right for Victor Wood minyama and on the health front it is funny how we do this just because he's tall and lanky we just assume we diagnosed him as injury prone there is no  evidence coming into the NBA that he had injury issues this wasn't something he dealt with in France we just assumed because you've seen it time and time again but until a guy I think it's a lesson for all of us until a guy shows you that he's injury prone don't just assume that he is based on Bill that doesn't always work that way yeah so for me he's in contention for that number one pick absolutely because I think you have to just like any second year player you project a jump right I think first and foremost to jump in minutes I would hope that he's not playing 28 minutes a game in year two you'll see what that Spurs roster ultimately looks like and if they could be a more competitive team but  you know I mean on the year he's at 20 and a half points 10 rebounds three assists 1.3 steals 3.3 blocks it's like  we've seen a lot of players especially Superstar players you think of like the leap that LeBron made from year one to year two he added like eight or nine points per game you know he added a couple of assists a couple of steals a couple you know a couple of rebounds I don't see why women Yama can't necessarily do that right it's like the rebounds one that one's interesting it's like Kenny  maybe that's just more of a permit projection is if you playing 34 minutes to go from 10 rebounds to 12 rebounds like yeah I think you can see that I think he could be a 25-point score pretty easily I think he could be closer to four or five assists the passing is the number one thing that stuck out to me brain and I know like the shop blocking is what tends to grab most of the highlights on Twitter the passing is unreal and the amount of bonuses that he's had that don't make the Highlight Reel because nobody finishes it like he makes like flashy passes right and I know some people look at that and say oh your hot dog and coaches don't like that what's the point I was victimized by that as a high school player those are effective I will tell you people do it yeah it looks cool that's that's like 40% of the reason that you make a past like that but the other reason is it's effective you're misleading the defense right you're generating a more open look than you would if you may if you look at somebody and drop them a bounce pass that's supposed to flip it behind your back and you know has that like you can't just learn that type of thing like those type of players you're just you're kind of born with that with that with that Gene like you know nobody just develops into a flashy player or develops into kind of having that sixth sense for passing and that to me has been a surprise me what could pass a little bit but I I think that's what's what I'm really interested to see like what kind of jump do we get in terms of the assists in terms of how much they're running through him because he still giving you you know a lot of nights he still giving you four five six and then you watch the Spurs they're not really making a point to get him the ball it's been better lately that it was early in  the season but if he becomes the centerpiece of that offence which eventually he will I think we can see a big leap there as well so I yeah he's somebody that I've like scared to not take that number one next year I I it it's not a knock against him you make a lot of good points in the in the assist Factor he's so good at so many other things I I think I overlooked his passing because I'm just so enamored with the three balls the guy of his size is ball handling his blocking his steals the ease of which he rebounds the basketball because of his height that  assists the assists are great but it's like sixth on the list for me of things that impressed me about Viktor wynd benea even though it's present my concern isn't with him it's it's the other players I don't want to downgrade like John we didn't even mention honest you know like Giannis is still amazing and all these other guys have put up such consistent numbers you know exactly what you're going to get from yokich Giannis Duncan I can already tell you their numbers next year it's still a projection for Victor when Ben and even though it feels like a safe projection I think I need to see I need to see how the Spurs upgrade and what that looks like in the offseason before I could go all in with saying yes stamp of approval he's my number one overall pick next year what does this team look like this year is not about us the Spurs playing a game around Victor when Benjamin this season is all about Victor women Yama feeling comfortable as a professional basketball player and just kind of getting his feet under him he's doing a remarkable job at that running away with rookie of the year because of it but this isn't the plan next year we're going to get an idea of what the plan looks like and I think we'll have an even better  idea when we see how the Spurs spend money in free agency last thing I'll say on this and I agree with everything you said but this is the Baseline right like this has been the worst case scenario as far as competitiveness as far as teammates as far as how long it took for them to to kind of accept that he's their best player and he's still the number seven player in fantasy basketball right like I don't I don't see him regressing in any single category right I mean I don't know I'm playing real basketball but they're not playing real basketball right now that's my concern they are they're they're kind of playing Sandlot ball and women is so far and away the best player that's out there I don't think he's like there's no way he slips next year beyond the 10th best he's gonna be a top 10 fantasy player next year I'm not trying to make a case against women I'm trying to make a case that he might not be as Surefire number one overall because they might actually play a real brand of basketball next year I view their growth similar to what we saw from the Houston Rockets the Rockets went from just a  what let's stand around and watch Jalen green shoot the basketball to now they play real they play real real basketball and we've seen the the week seen the fantasy stars and the and the the stats sort of shift out and Shane goon much more valuable now than he was a year ago because they're playing the game differently what does that look like next year you'll still probably have the same coach and Gregg Popovich but I think their team is gonna look completely different  all right let's talk about some of the biggest risers and fallers year-over-year you know as you start to look ahead to to you know next season with that theme of where we're taking women Yama yeah we're not that far for basketball season Brandon and I'm doing an NFL best ball right now you know right basically right after the season ends we'll start firing up our 202425 content you know Tyrese Maxey is the obvious one who comes to mind and you know he's started to fade a little bit but still not that much I mean he's top 30 player on the year was being drafted typically around pick 50 I think people you know be back next season we'll see if they make any other editions he's going to go higher Jalen Johnson obviously a winner as well I mean he's up like 60 spots compared to his Yahoo ADP he's up close to 80 spots in ESPN legs where he was drafted later  who else do you like who is there somebody else who you're very comfortable drafting in the top 40 or 50 who would have been you know well outside the top 75 this year I'm not sure if he ranked outside of the top 75 going into the year but a guy that would have been closer to that range that I feel really good about is the Contemporary of Victor wembanyama and Chet Holmgren he's he's kind of when bin Llama light and it's not even that light he's giving you all of those stats that we desire and fantasy basketball so this is a guy that is zooming up the board for me that I'm really excited about I'm curious to see on a on a lesser scale what the Bulls do to restructure their roster in the offseason they've kind of been in this Purgatory mode for the last couple of years but if Kobe white is still their point guard to start the year next season at a really bad game last night but that knot was standing this is a guy that I think with the consistency that he's shown throughout the course of the year I'd be willing to take a serious stab on him closer to that top 75 range so those are a couple of  guys that come to mind but we definitely seen some big time risers I think Jalen Brunson if you're talking about a more high-profile player has seen his stock go from good to great with the way that he's played this year too yeah I think there was still a little bit of all right we need to see this again from Jalen Brunson and yeah if you bought in at 80 P this year you're fine and you know I think it's gonna be tougher for him to have a better season than he's had this year so you know just like you probably take him at Cost next year and hopefully he just repeats it which you should be able to he's super durable you know I think that the one concern would be you know is this finally the summer raining where they bring in another start in New York I would say history was strongly suggest probably not another jail in jail during you know he's he's hanging around ranked 60 overall this season and you know I think much like homegrown and weapon Yama pretty easy to dream on him hopefully being in a better situation feels like it cannot get any worse that is been in Detroit this year you know he had an injury early in the season the rotations have been a complete mess he's got terrible teammates around him and he ranks basically at the top of the list of like every rebounding metric that you could find the only thing is for a big man like the field goal percentage is nice he's not a terrible free throw shooter he doesn't take that many but he's like 75% which for  us for a center you'll take that  doesn't really give you a whole lot defensively you know it'd be really nice if in addition to you know 14 and 14 every night he could at least get you to a block per game and that hasn't really been there yeah yeah and I think he still has so much room to grow as as a player he's so physically gifted and and even though it doesn't seem like we know what the Pistons plan is he's gonna be a part of it looking at the rank the ADP from the start of the year he was at 112 consensus ADP so this is a guy that has clearly outkicked his coverage there someone in his range was pick one around 116 Brandon Miller I have I like him a lot coming into the league I wasn't sure what his fantasy viability would be because they play such a lamelo ball brand of basketball but I wouldn't be surprised if they start to build the team around him I think he's the best I think he's the best winning type of basketball player lamelo ball is a highlight reel but I just don't feel like he's a winning NBA player I think Brandon Miller is the kind of player you can build your team around and it seems like the Hornets are starting to get that Vibe as well he's a guy that's going to zoom up the draft board compared to where he was the start of  the year very very interested to see where he goes that's a great one I mean he's a top 35 player over the last 15 games and he's still he's still mixing in some some bad performance right as any rookie would so yeah I I don't know if I'm gonna be the guy who's you know leading the charge on Brandon Miller like am I taking him like in the top 40 overall next year probably not but certainly something that'll be more on my radar than he was coming into this season in terms of fallers I think lamelos got to be on that list right I mean when he's been out there he's looked like himself but this is you know it becoming a very concerning early career Trend where he's played 51 75/36 and now currently 22 games this season I don't know if we see him again this year the way this is going on probably but who knows  I mean nobody's taking him with the 12th overall pick next year it's just way too risky  no no not at all I think that was even that was that felt like a mistake at the time it was just like we look at his numbers you  I don't like injury from players and he is not he is definitely first of all his last name is ball which means he can't stay on the basketball floor yeah he he's definitely somebody that's gonna I think it goes hand in hand with the Brandon Miller evaluation that if you like Brandon Miller then you shouldn't like lamelo ball because even though their teammates the one is gonna Zoom pass the other in terms of a viability and definitely trustability going into next year not sure trustability is a word by the way you might want to fact check on that you're not gonna check we're just gonna say it is okay I got I've got a quick Riser and a Faller that I'm just scanning the board of the ADP from the start of the year Jalen Williams of the Oklahoma City Thunder major Riser right okay and we don't often see this but tell me if you agree a rookie Faller we usually a guy that we get excited about as a rookie  usually moves up the next year I'm wondering if scoot Henderson actually moves down it was the 70th overall pick I think and I was in this Camp I was on the whim Beyond a scoot Henderson train and swinging a Miss on scoot I don't know how much more confidence we're going to have going into next year I don't think he's he would be a major Faller but I wonder if he dips down a little bit past 70 closer to like 75 80 range so one of my rare victories this year was completely staying away from scoot in fantasy and I obviously didn't think he'd be this bad I thought he'd be much better but rookie guard the general even when they play well they don't necessarily translate to good fantasy players I think was screwed all it's going to take is he has like a nice 10 game run at the end of the year much like Shane sharp did last year and everybody's gonna buy back in the promise got to get back a little bit right yeah if he's just kind of in and out like they said last night he's gonna miss probably at least three more games you know Portland is just horrendous on offense right now it's been tough for them I think if he shows even like an inkling of upside down the stretch there will be people that will buy back in and I do think he'll prove right I'm not I'm not just like completely write him off after a bad situation and in one year but yeah you know it doesn't really feel like there's a whole lot of scoot momentum right now and you mentioned Jayla Williams when he was going after Josh Getty  in most drafts on average he was going in the mid-80s in some formats on some host sites so yeah he is a he's a major Riser as well I mean Jordan Poole I think has to be on the list of fallers right I mean there's winning the scoring title yeah thankfully I I can't clean this as a victory I just didn't have them anywhere I wasn't supposed to take him you know I wouldn't say I was going out to Target him but nobody thought it was going to be this bad I mean this is just been an all-time you know flop season for Jordan Poole I had one more McCall Bridges so we touched on earlier right I mean in some ways he was going as high as the 16th overall pick that was his ADP in Underdog which is you know mostly basketball so you got you know you're taking a few more chances but I think we've had a bit of a reset on McCall Bridges all right let's talk or ten a couple more questions and we'll be out of here  James says any news on lamelo I'm sick and tired of it same here brother he's single-handedly tanked what was otherwise a great nfkc team for me  didn't play last night you know he practiced about a week ago coming out of the break that felt like a step in the right direction there's been no news no news to report they played Milwaukee again in Milwaukee tomorrow then they're at Philly on Friday at Toronto on Sunday  I don't know I mean sometimes you don't see guys you know come back during a road trip who knows that I'm sorry they actually are in Charlotte tomorrow so keep an eye on that game as a potential return again I think we see him at some point it's not like the Hornets are in danger of winning games when he's out there but yeah it's been just a complete disaster Kobe white and Jordan Poole rest of season as eyman if it's either or I'm obviously taking Kobe white but you know we're starting to see I don't think we have much to say on Kobe white right we've talked about him a time like I think it you just kind of is who he is going forward he's gonna keep playing a ton of minutes with Zach LaVine out of the mix I think the question is Jordan Poole it's like are you if you were somebody that dropped him are you comfortable picking him back up as you shown enough since moving to the bench that he's become viable again like I still in the camp that I probably don't trust him but you know he's giving you three point three threes per game just moving to the bench 20 points the spark is been there I guess to some degree he's also shooting 306% yeah I I'm good on on leaving him off the roster for the rest of the year  all right yeah I think we can we can leave it at that well end on this one George says hey Nick Cannon thoughts on what's been happening to Fred Van Vleet  yeah I mean just a really bad game for Van Fleet last night that was a competitive game and still Casey until the Thunder pulled away late really fun game actually he went to 11 from the field one of seven from three the assistant been down since he came back I'm not super worried though he's playing a ton of minutes like it'd be a different story if you know they were marginalizing him and he's playing like 31 minutes but you know he was limited a bit his first game back since then 3738 36 minutes we kind of know van Fleet is right even even in his Peak Toronto days he would still mix in these these bad shooting nights yeah I think the shooting volume just needs to the shooting volume needs to increase but he's not the kind of guy that's just going to Chuck up shots if it's not there doesn't feel like it is right now so he's letting other teammates get involved they have enough guys on that team that can shoot so if if you don't feel like you have it there's there's no harm in passing the Rock and his assist numbers for the most part of been there so not overly concerned  all right we'll wrap it up here you can hear more NBA talk on the road to wire MBA show check that out on Sirius XM 7730 Eastern every night that's myself
