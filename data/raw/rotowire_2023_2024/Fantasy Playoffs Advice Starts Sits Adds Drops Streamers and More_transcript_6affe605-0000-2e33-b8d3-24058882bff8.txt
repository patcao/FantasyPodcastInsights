making smarter choices along the way thank you supported intelligence we are in the stretch run Alex starting the playoffs you know beginning tonight at least the Yahoo League that I'm in that's how it works some playoffs have been underway already of course some leaks going through game 82 but we are officially in the crunch time period for Fantasy Basketball so we will talk all about that we'll take your live questions we'll talk about the injuries from The Weeknd the injuries to keep an eye on this week we got a unique schedule with a couple of teams playing two games we'll talk about some streaming candidates throughout the show do a little look back at the notables from Jose pretty fun weekend now in the NBA and we continue to see I think a pretty tangible shift in the style of play especially when you compare it to you know how a lot of games were transpiring back into December of January  yeah the MBA there was a clear sort of directive by the league to call fewer fouls the special those initiated by the offensive player I think maybe at some point you know basically what happens is some reporter gets tipped off to it and then you know they report on it like everybody else know this is it and that that cycle continues at first the MBA denies it and then they're like oh we may have actually told our refs something but we saw I mean we've seen you know games be a lot more physical a lot more competitive lower scoring and I think you know two games I would say three games that I watched that really sort of I really noticed the shift was it was actually earlier last week you know there was Indiana versus OKC and then yeah on Saturday we had Nick's Kings which was more like a heavyweight prize fight that it was a basketball game but it was it was awesome and then I mean Mavericks nuggets in addition to Kyrie's insane Lefty hook running hook game winner was also extremely physical  and was just a ton of fun man I've been really enjoying it yeah I mean I I'm not going to dive in on like the analytics and of scoring is down about four points per team over the last month which is pretty significant I mean especially with the way things were heading where it felt like you know we do the MBA show on NBA Radio every night and it's like all right totals at 2:47 and a half like that just you know and now you look on the board and like I mean Vegas is obviously responded as you would expect like we were not seeing those type of totals night in and night out and yeah I think you can still find examples in every given day right like yesterday the Bucks got to 140 against the Phoenix Suns and they had 70 plus in the first half partially because Bobby borders played the half of his life but we are seeing it certainly feels anecdotally in the numbers with back this up that a lot more of those games played in the you know 105 to 98 type of range which I I think that's exactly what the NBA wants right I don't think they have a Target score in mind but it almost feels to me like the All-Star game which should not have anything to do with this but it felt like that was the final straw it was like all right all right we've let this go along enough we need to do something and I know there is still a lot of conf as far as what exactly has happened you know what she had a report I think it was on Friday you know that Bebo at been sent out the MBA basically denied it but the results are there the results are pretty clear and you know we're still seeing plenty of games in the 120s like that it's not like that's gonna be completely eradicated but we're seeing fewer consistent games reaching one way right like the Hawks for a while it felt like we're just guaranteed to score 130 every night which I will say speaking as a as a fan as somebody who watches a ton of basketball who you know wants to see as many teams as I can I don't think the ideal scenario is every team scoring in the 90s or every team scoring in the 130s you want a little bit of both right like you wanted to feel you almost want to feel more like college football I guess one of the reasons I love college football is you get such a diversity of style right you have some teams that are trying to score 70 every game and they might allow 70 you have other teams that are trying to win every game 13 to 11 you know I think that contrasting style is something that's maybe been missing a little bit from the modern NBA over the last decade or so yeah even today I'm looking at the  the slate no games over 225 over under the very bizarre of what that would have been insane in December another thing I you know you mentioned like you're not it's kind of unclear exactly what the directive is like what are what exactly are they not calling versus what are they calling to me it just feels like if you aren't like stop calling the offensive initiated where the guy just slams into the defender first of all stop calling that and then second of all if you aren't 100% sure about the call just don't call it don't call anything like you know just get instead of calling something on a 50/50 just don't call anything let them play and I you know the point that you bring up about  you know not necessarily walking to see like games in the 130s for when team score that much are fun but  when when there is so much physicality  and the game is it gets so ground down to again really physical basketball those moments were guys make these super athletic smooth moves and they get wide open they look so much better it's it's unbelievable like you know watching uh you know Dallas Denver uh it's you know again super physical but then when Kyrie does something he bumps into somebody really hard there's no call he 360 spins he goes between the legs he pump fakes he gets contact he Fades away it's like it's more unbelievable than it was when you were watching these games where everything was Ticky tack it felt I got into a rhythm and it just felt like it was too easy and you're like I'm not surprised when someone's 40 points it's just of course they did but now when someone scores 40 and you watch him you watch the game you're like oh my God this is incredible you said exactly what I wanted you to say which is that it looked too easy and it's a testament more to the skill I think of modern offensive players that anything else like every player will tell you you see this on podcast and whatnot you know even a couple months ago when this was in the news you know you'd see players say like look we're trying our defense fan like it's alright we're just going out there not doing anything it's like you just can't so I think you know what the MBA is perhaps subtly trying to do is give those Defenders a little bit of an advantage back and you know 20 years ago the advantage was way too far in favor of the defense and I think two months ago it was swung too far in the direction of the offense and I think there is a balance to be struck there because offensive players are better now than they were in 2003 when you know you're getting a hand checked by Chase on Prince every time you're handling the ball and I think you have to find a way for defense to compensate because that that skill level is not going to diminish there's that like we're just gonna go into a dirth of basketball skill and the next 20 years like if anything it's probably going to continue ascending so when you have not only more skilled players but you have more players on the court who are skilled I think that's part of it too is like even think back to like I don't know what 10 12 years ago the NBA Finals it's like every team had like a Kendrick Perkins at center it's like you needed that guy that you didn't really have to worry about like almost no team is doing that now right I think not only are players more skilled but everybody on the court has to be accounted for and and of course you know that means more spacing more guys you have to respect more open lanes so I I don't want to go too deep on this because it is to still a little bit conceptual and I'll be interested to see you know does it sustain through the end of the regular season and into the playoffs but I I will say I am okay with the NBA stepping in on the Fly I don't think this is something where you have to wait until mid-season because it really had gotten to the point where I think the product was diminished  yeah I don't I don't mind them stepping in and doing it right now is actually as we as we lean into the playoffs I think it's good for the players to get used to that physicality now before the playoffs rather than all the stuff in the playoffs start and everybody's playing physical and he can make a shock because they're not used to the contact it's also interesting that they made this decision before March Madness because I do feel like a  there's a strong portion of people who watch college basketball that believe like don't watch the NBA because they're like these guys it's all Ticky tack they get touched and there's no foul against just the you know pretty Madonna's and stuff and now they make this change and you can't you cannot say that anymore you watch these NBA games like it's just like a car crash out there well I'll let you in a secret there I think most of those people are not watching the game so they probably have no idea they have noticed they don't even know  yeah those people have not watched games in years so I don't think that they're gonna notice you know a trend like this over the last month but interesting nonetheless all right we'll get into some more weekend recap stuff in a bit but we'll take some questions here Paul possibly the earliest question we've ever received in the history of this pod we go live at 2:30 Central this came in at 10:20 a.m. so thank you for that Paul says I have a bye week and I want to stream Trey man for next week when he has four games the bottom Five Guys I have are Jalen Suggs Kelly Olynyk Alex Caruso amen Thompson Lopez and maybe Middleton question mark should I drop any of those players to pick up Trey Nance so we're looking at next week Alex so that would be the week that starts Monday March 25th  yeah do not dropping please so special after you just came back I  you know all in the chat Christopher Scott says what is sucks done for you lately good question actually um I think sucks is probably the drop in theory here and look so excited as good games he gets a steal pretty much every single game he had some nice assist games he has some nice scoring it is what it is but he's worse than Alex Caruso and man is going to get you more assists I don't know how many more steals you need necessarily so I would I think I'd be completely fine with um with dropping Suggs for for Trey man  well the other thing with Suggs is he has three games and Caruso has four on the Thompson has four the books do play three but I'm with you I think  I think I hold Middleton you know you have a little bit of time to kind of see how this develops if there's anything coming out of yesterday's game with him returning but importantly despite Milwaukee playing three games that week we're talking next week none of them are back to backs So in theory khris Middleton should be out there for all three of those games if that makes you nervous you know if you worry about a minute's limit I get that so I think including him in this discussion is reasonable but they got a couple of good matchups against the Lakers in the Hawks they also play at New Orleans next week so those should be pretty decent spots for Middleton but yeah I think if you're playing The Game's played argument you know it's like even if sucks at 4 games I think they're being a case here right like it really depends on how much you need steals because that's the one category with him that's been consistent he's been hitting some threes lately but again I would rather have I think four games of Trey mad the three of jail and sucks yeah but it's also not like Trey man hasn't been stealing the ball he's too steals a game since the All-Star break and he's giving you you know it I mean the averages are forces but he had one zero assist game in there um and yeah so it's that I think we said our thoughts on that  yeah I think that's the move go trade man pick him up get the four games wanna see who's Charlotte plays just for reference they they're at Cleveland home for Cleveland home for Golden State home for the Clippers so not not fantastic but for games is four games this point in the season Christopher said weakly Lock Lee points considering the Triple J pattern of only playing against good teams any chance he plays against the Spurs because of the Wimpy factor it's the playoffs really need three games from him so basically a do we trust Jaron Jackson question if I'm understanding this correctly Alex and  Memphis this week does have three games the majority of the league has three games we should point out both Charlotte and Dallas only have two games so good week to have Trey man if you have a bye week as Paul did otherwise pretty brutal if you're if you're holding Luca of Kyrie guys like that but Jerry Jackson 3 games for the Grizzlies is there any possible way to predict when Jaren Jackson is going to play I don't really think so you know the pattern has kind of been he's played against good teams against Bad teams although  maybe we buried the lead a little bit not to not to not answer your question but that's been Bane came back he actually came back it's very shocking to me any played 32 minutes against first game back  is that is that recommended who who thinks that's a good idea I don't know he goes for 22 and 7 pretty nice game all around so I don't know if Bane coming back effects now what they're going to do with Jared Jackson I still don't think Triple J is trustworthy  I would I think I would just lean on starting Jaxon  if you only get two games out of him  it's still gonna be a pretty productive two games you're gonna get out of him and the chance of getting a third game to me I had to turn that down it's tough because they played tonight in the late window right so you at least know if he's out there tonight or not and as of right now he's not on the injury report so the expectation should be that he plays and like if that's the case it's like all right we are at least locked in one game and then he's in your lineup and you know that's that if he ends up being ruled out tonight and you have to make some sort of late swap I would just be ready to do that in which case you know then you're only looking at a Max of two games so I think you have to live with that look at their schedule they don't they don't play any back to back so they play Monday Wednesday Friday he has most he sat out back to backs of late but he set up both halves of them so it's not really clear if it's you know that much of a workload thing or just kind of how the schedule breaks down and you know they get Sacramento Golden State and the San Antonio Spurs I  I it's tough to really find a pattern for me out say I guess he has played more against the reasonably good teams lately but I don't know he also sat out against Milwaukee before the All-Star break like are we really saying that like Atlanta and Philly or good teams relative to you know Brooklyn and Charlotte like I guess I just I don't know if that's like what would be the thinking behind that if you're the grizzly do you think that's actually what they're doing or is it just coincidental I mean it could be it's hard to say I mean if you were trying to play your guys in games that you're probably gonna lose any way like it's not gonna make a difference a Triple J plays and I don't know but yeah I mean I I would just I would just start it to be honest with you if I had but my team I would just start him and hope to get three games  okay Christopher followed up and said he could also go with four games from Aaron Nesmith or Donald Benton so are those are those more appealing to you I the band thing is so tough for me because there's so much up in the air for Portland you know I was going through and doing some projection stuff last night and it's like well they're they're claiming that you know Jeremy Grant's gonna play he's now doubtful for tonight but he's you know he's been in and out lately they're cleaning brogden's coming back at some point like with Benton you're getting the upside of like 40 plus minutes if things remain stable but at any point it feels like this rotation could shift pretty dramatically  I mean  yeah I mean if you're asking who is the best fan as he player right now out of  you know  nie Smith and it's actually Benton yeah but whose biggest do I trust the lease baton  who do I trust the lead who do I trust to play the fewest games Jaron Jackson who do I trust to be the worst fantasy player out of all these guys are nice Smith so it's like I feel like you're in like a damned if you do damned if you don't situation with these three guys  I think you explained it perfectly I think me Smith is the safest I think Banton I wouldn't say yes the highest upside because I think Triple J even in three games still as the higher upside more so than me Smith I'm saying yeah yeah but even bad you know it's like fans playing well he's playing a ton of minutes I still think if you get three three bangers out of Jared Jackson that's probably better than a three-game or a four game total for men but it could be close I mean he's been scored a ton he doesn't the defensive stats have come on he went like five games in a road with no Steals on that four against the Knicks so I don't know if we can really depend on that but I guess maybe the bigger question and and this can kind of digress from the original question is like when it comes to band and how worried are we about Malcolm Brogden or is this like the same situation is saying oh my balls going to come back and ruin Trey man  yeah well pretty similar to that um yeah  I and even if Brockton does come back you know is he gonna play every game when he's back is he going to be playing 30 minutes because what are the chances they're in competitive games pretty low is broadening gonna be out there in fourth quarters and non competitive games probably not and even if Brogan does come back where they gonna do a Jeremy Grant because band is big enough to play like one through four basically for Portland because he is six seven but he is a good pastor he's a really just you know the Raptors had them I think that tells you all you need to know about what kind of a player he is  all right we'll move on from Delano Banton who is could be like an all-time remember that guy in the final weeks of fantasy the way he's playing Matt loyal listener loyal viewer always appreciate the questions from him he says I'm in my finals and I have to take two players off of ill I can only keep one of the following three  Trey Jones Jeremy Sohan Nick Richards this is head-to-head points with a double double bonus leak  interesting um  Trey Jones I mean he is at this point I mean for most of his career he's basically an assist specialist  and Sohan you know he's kind of up and down is giving you just an assortment of stats like the sort of you know I don't know you get like 14 7 and 3 kind of stuff which is solid  but  he's  yeah and then I you know because none of these guys  I guess Richards is in theory the guy who's going to probably give you the most consistent double doubles but he's not giving you much else right he's not really giving you blocks  you know I I don't know if there's a  well do you have do you have a strong opinion on 80s guys  well first of all if if this coming week is your fantasy final it's a two game week for Charlotte right so I I think does that just eliminate Nick Richards it dispersed have three games you know could still be closed maybe it depends how like crazy this double double bonuses because he's the most likely of those three to get you that but that that's probably not enough to push it over yeah I mean Charlotte plays tomorrow against Orlando Saturday against Atlantis  Spurs this week played Dallas Memphis Phoenix I think he got to take the three games in this scenario and it depends a little bit more on your category needs like how much oh it's not that points League overall so we're not really worried about that I suppose  I would think I would just go trade show and you know where I stand on Sohan  maybe higher night to night upside but also a much lower floor to me so I would slightly lean Jones then so on then Richard based on the schedule  the schedule points very good yeah if it's just for this week then that's that's what you gotta do yeah between Sohan and Troy Jones you got just go with whatever guy fits the  the head-to-head strategy that you're using you know are you if you're punting rebounds just keep Jones if you're punting assist keep keep Sohan  all right Christian Rogers says good afternoon fellas dejounte Murray stat correction on Yahoo calls me to lose the rebound category and get knocked out of the playoffs oh my goodness loss is matchup six to five the score had changed three times last night all caps pain  Christian I feel you man I feel you I've had some fat Corrections this year mostly on like prize picks you know their fall they use a third party stats provider where you think you're good and then also said you know says he got jail during 13 rebounds he checked again 10 minutes later he's magically down to 12 I I would like there to be a more exact science here or just like you know I'm okay with these not necessarily updating exactly live like don't don't update until we know for sure what's going to be official here  that would be awesome if they just present it provided you for me even checking until like the next day it's just like you want to I like being able to check it live but to me it's is it worth like you know this fear especially in this situation right where it's like your whole your whole Fantasy Life comes down to one rebound that they decide to take away yeah that's really annoying that's nothing you can do about there unfortunately yeah all right a couple notes here from Johnny says what's up fellas thank you for all the info y'all gave me you helped me stay in first place all right Johnny appreciate you dropping by each week it says I have a bye week and I picked up  TJ Bagley and Duncan who else should I drop Lively or hold okay interesting phrasing here  I assume you picked up TJ McConnell Marvin Bagley and Duncan Robinson you know can't really necessarily tell you who to drop on your roster  but you want to if you're wondering if you should drop Derek Lively  that's a fair question I mean first of all when it comes to Bagley out because I believe he's still he was still out yesterday we have really no idea when he's going to be back he's missed like eight games in a row now Washington plays tomorrow we can see Houston Thursday Saturday  so I mean just not not knowing bagley's status and knowing where the Wizards are right now it's like would you rather just hold Lively  I'm fine with holding Lively sorry I was just looking at they wizard sat basically everybody yesterday and I am I just sorted by minutes uh from the game 36 for Justin champagne  32 for Patrick Baldwin  25 for Anthony Guild drew a man named Jules Bernard play 24 minutes never heard of them uh 22 minutes for Johnny Davis this is incredible I think they're yeah yesterday right  yeah yeah Jules Bernard um yeah I I agree with what Nick said Bagley who even knows man you may never come back I don't know what to tell you like these teams are they're so bad and they're operating like this who knows and it's a back injury so it's like it's really easy for them to be like I will hold you up because back in jerseys are serious and it's really uncomfortable to play with the back injury obviously so um I'm actually fine just keeping Derek Lively for the points it'd be hard to drop back legally but  I don't know  this Jules Bernard guy as a peered in a living games this year  I don't believe in games this is the first time that he's seen real minutes but he's apparently like Ben he played in the game in December never heard of him  he was the 45th recruit in the 2018 class okay Four Seasons in a while I mean look we're in the weeds as much in like trash and like G league and summer league it the fact that someone can just slip by and I never heard of them I feel almost feel like embarrassed and like I don't know who Jules Bernard is yeah I know and like I watched more college basketball than you I should I shouldn't is um the one that really hit me this year and this one kind of went semi-viral was the honor all the team guy oh yeah for the Bulls who's now like playing real minutes every night so it's like we know we is now but he had that game I think it was against the cows like three weeks ago where it was one of the Bulls like crazy come from behind wins that they found like 10 of this year and he played 28 minutes and I'm like who in the heck like the photo almost looks like AI generated like that it's such a like you're 25 years into your 2K Dynasty type of name like if they don't a little fishy  yeah it's very bizarre I had noticed his name at some point so I I had been on the I'd been on the team trained I think before some other people Yeah but I  I was very much caught off guard by the whole Saga I guess he's playing 17 minutes a game over the last three weeks here so if you're in a deeper league if you're in a league where you have to roster or Turkish rookie B Team might be the dude Kenny says playoffs next week nine Cat 10 team had to head who's better to hold for the rest of the season  Olynyk versus hartenstein to Sumo versus herb Jones versus amen Thompson okay so we'll start with the first one Olynyk versus hardenstein  man um  so I would I would lean Olynyk I think is the better fantasy player  right now he still worries me in terms of like is Toronto really gonna have Kelly Olynyk who is 32 years old playing 28 minutes again for the rest of the guys buried in a step back hat  yes and you're so your playoffs start next week that's late unfortunately I wish your playoffs did not start that gives me anxiety I wish they started earlier  but I so I will go all the Nick for the first one  do you have any thoughts about the last like that Trio well first of all I'm looking at the schedule so next week the Knicks play four times the Raptors play three times beyond that the Knicks play four times and the Raptors play four times a week after so not but over the course of two weeks assuming you're alive for both we're talking about a one game difference I I would lean Olynyk partially because of all the things you said which were correct and partially because is it totally out of the question that Randall and or Robinson could come back in the next two weeks  like I think that's possible well I mean the the next word that I just disabled player exception for Mitchell Robinson because the MBA came in and were like you were lying Mitchell Robinson could come back he's fine so yeah that is a I would say a mild concern yeah yeah  yeah I just I think that's it's out there and I think it's totally possible that one excuse me one of those guys could be back for the other one is to move versus herb gel Jones versus amen Thompson yeah I mean right away my first inclination would be to Sumo just because the minutes continue to be so crazy although it sounds like Kobe white might be able to return tonight even with that you know he's still played high 30s low 40s most nights gotta still live with the floor games you know or he'll just play 40 minutes and somehow I have 7 points and three assists but giving you the accounting stats the percentages have been pretty good you know herb Jones has definitely had an emergency so with these last couple of weeks like he went through a pretty quiet stretch the offense is kind of lagged a little bit but the defensive stats are back with her Jones and then we got amen Thompson hanging out in Houston trying to you know some of the the Shen and empty started three in a row now he's gonna give you rebound he's going to give you defensive stats I mean he's what like 17 of 22 from the floor over the last two games  yeah I think it's interesting lineup changed for Houston I do like starting a man because you surrounded him with Shooters and he kind of just do his thing on both ends of the Court  but yeah all these three guys who would I start I would start to soon move I think he is he hasn't been consistent game to game lately but he's having more swings in terms of big games small game big game small game but I just think from a role perspective his is the safest he's done it basically for months now this you know stats so this is stat specific stuff aside you know if you're punting certain categories whatever just blind I would just start to soon move here  yeah I mean if you if you have all these guys on your roster as a like dropping or picking them up like I think  I think you can go week to week here you know like I would go to Sumo for the week ahead but the week after I think 2017 have four games at the Bulls are one of the only three teams that have three games so at that point then you go back to to Herb Jones or I'm at Thompson so you know you have you know some options at your disposal but that's the way I would lean  good question from Christian he says what has happened to Jonas found junis he's one of the main reasons I lost my rebound category in the playoffs I was thinking about this last night out so I was doing some work for the site  didn't this happen last year too or was it two years ago where it's like he was having this great year and then for whatever reason they just went for like a month of like yeah we're just gonna play 18 minutes at night yup he is down to yeah 19 minutes a game over his past 10  they have been running a lot of Larry Nance out there to be honest at Center a lot more Dynamic player  better passer he's more mobile he can catch lobs he can shoot threes and I just think with how much their featuring Zion now  they  I don't think this is always been the kind of confusing part about the balance unit fit is like the last thing you want in a lineup with Zion is this like plotting Lotte Lane clogging big  who is not that athletic or is not doing that much other stuff out there so I think they're just settling into a lineup that they like and what's happened to him I just think this is I my guess is if you told me you know over under 24 minutes a game for the rest of the season I'm taking on her yeah I think you're right I mean the Pelicans non coincidentally are in arguably the best stretch of their season right here right so I don't think they're going to change this up until they really need to they're also healthier then they've been for much of the year you know when it felt like you know one of like herb Jones or Trey Murphy or Zion was always banged up and I think they have so many guys that it's just it's hard for bound to consistently be this 26/28 minute guy every night and it's working right I mean they're having success go in smaller being a little bit more versatile putting Zion on the ball a bit more there's a report this morning by the way that Zions down 25% since the in season tournament  that's seems like a lot I I'm willing to say looks more trim more athletic 25 pounds I think that'd be more noticeable and just just saying I mean you know Zion is a guy he plays himself into shape  I think the I think the reason that he has been so big is because he hasn't been playing and now that he's playing I think he's just down 25 pounds I think it's possible  but yeah I mean that's it it's like we've been saying it just in terms of like a lot of you know a lot of these times you're you're going up against teams who special their backup five is not really a five sometimes you know and it's not going to punish you physically so you can be out there without a center for like six seven minutes a game easily and you're like well I can put Zion out there with Ingram with Trey Murphy with herb Jones let's just do that so unfortunately I think this is and this is where it's going to be for Valentine's  all right Van Damme says would you prefer hardenstein or Conley for tonight only 10 team points leagues so looks like we got daily lineups here FYI thanks for the advice on Gary Trent as well I don't know if I can take credit for that was that you  historically I have been a Gary Trent guy so I'm gonna assume that what I said that it was what something I said let's say that okay well he said the advice was to pick him up last week so that must have been you guys on Friday right uh yeah sure why not yeah I I been burned too many times by that man I don't know anything you know remotely confident about him Gary Trent will he will absolutely burn you in a normal  regular season setting but in this setting for the Toronto Raptors where they're playing like seven guys and for those guys are like was part of their normal rotation Gary Trent will take shots  Conley or hartstein for tonight well the Knicks are in Golden State  and Minnesota is in Utah the Utah match up obviously much easier  I would worry a little bit if I was New York if I was rostering if I started and shine that the Warriors would run small and then maybe Tibbs would be some more chew out there maybe hard to say but you tell us a really soft Apollonia and it's kindly used to play there so he could be comfortable so you're right about heart and study played 20 minutes they luckily played the Warriors a few weeks ago we played 20 minutes 6.6 rebounds one steal  two of five from the field so it's it's not a great matchup for somebody like him it's special because like you said they have a two other they're not really afraid to throw Jericho Sims into the mix as well there is no ogn and Obi tonight for the next not sure if that really matters for hartenstein probably not but something to keep an eye on and then I would Minnesota go Bears questionable Kyle Anderson's questionable and Monte Morris back a point guards also questionable I think  of those three the Kyle Anderson one is maybe what impacts commonly the most just as far as Anderson spending time on the ball doing a little bit more Distributing I mean you're picking between in my opinion too  fairly under options  Connolly's played really well the last two games  those were like his two best offensive games in the entire year so you do wonder if that could continue his you know he's 10 for 18 for three in the last two games  I do think I would still lean that way though because this is a really good matchup again to Utah and if you have to make that decision right now you know if Kyle Anderson's out I think that that gives them a pretty decent boost as well  I agree with everything you said at the same time I  I'm always you know he's going up against Kris Dunn in theory although maybe the put down on Anthony please  they might talk about Anthony Edwards I take that back yeah I mean I think Conley's fine like like Nick said if Kyle Anderson's out even go Bears out there's gonna be used to opening up  all right we got a question here from Paul I if I'm summarizing this correctly I believe the question is essentially should I drop us our Thompson and plan on keeping some money from Techo over the longer term here as we've played out in Detroit  fair question you know SARS Gonna Miss what is fifth straight game now  due to an illness which is a little weird it's like it's an asthma thing  right  that's what I mean yeah  I mean I don't know really a whole lot about asthma but like I thought it was just like a one game thing like he just couldn't play in one game but it was he was like an ass by attack  it could have been it seems like all we have really that was an asthma flare-up so I wish I I don't know okay so well either way I appreciate the clarity there they have a four game week he's not gonna play tonight that leaves a maximum of three games you know fontecchio dealing with the toe injury you know that time of year those two injuries can get you he is questionable for tonight  I would be more confident that he either plays through that or Mrs less time than usar I mean fatako started for in a row he's played 34 plus minutes and all four  completely different player from Asar tops and in terms of the stat profile but I think given what we know right now I think I would go on Deck you  I find with fontecchio  yeah I will I will I mean the thing I will say is I have almost make this clarification all the time  what kind of League are you in if you're are you in a rodeo you had to head League where it's like if you need the blocks and Steals and rebounds or assists you go you go with SAR if you need the if you need the points in threes you go find you  so there's some  you know you gotta weigh that a little bit but yeah just sort of blind I don't really know when it's coming back and funky past 30 days per game eight cat has been better like a star  so I'm fine with that  good question for Patrick he says is hero a drop it might not be man I'd have to be out at least another week you know if yours is one of those leagues where it's like this is the semi-finals and next week is the finals like I think so right I mean even if you comes back what are you getting like a maximum of two games or is limited  yeah depends on what your playoffs is yeah I would prefer not to have the couch it like that but it  100% depends on when your playoff says I think if you have if you have to win  within the next two weeks your matchup  then  probably you have to drop them because it's reevaluating one to two weeks which dealing with what we have dealt with injury wise in terms of Nick and I like covering this for a long time I'm always going to lean on the longer end of that time table when they say reevaluated so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna assume he's out for two weeks  I think you have to if it's illegally that goes through game 82 and you can just keep him chilling and I our spot I'm okay with that you know and if you're in  if you're in a deeper League it also comes down to like all right who are you grabbing you know it's like are you are you dropping Tyler hero so you could go pick up markelle fultz you know at that point it's like it's even worth it are you getting enough out of it to to justify the potential downside of Tyler hero coming back sooner than we expect and somebody else in your league picking him up like I think if I'm in like a 10 or 10 12 Team league and I could get somebody out there who's a real Difference Maker you know if I could add I don't know Trey man or somebody like that like then you have to do it but if you're if you're just if you're talking about work in the margins and just adding somebody just to add someone you might not even be putting in your starting lineup I I would say it's worth hanging on to hear I think Desmond Bane would be kind of the cautionary tale version of this yeah and you know beIN a lot of these do I drop this guy questions when there are situations like this  some of it does depend on League size like you like you just said if you're a 10 Team league and you have Tyler hero uh way less risk and dropping him and just streaming other guys in because 10 teams have a ton of great struggle guys in The Wire all the time I've always had the same thing for beIN but if you're a 16 Team league and you had Bane or you have hero now it's a lot harder to make that decision because realistically who are you picking up  all right Daniel says please rank the following players for the rest of the week nine cats daily lineup League Payton Pritchard the Unicorn is that porzingis  I'm gonna assume yeah  okay noira and Dante Porter  I wish I could I wish I could be It's gotta be cornette right actually I don't know yeah is a I'm not the check basketball reference  the Green Corvette is on there look  right man cornette okay that's a I didn't know thank you I was gonna say it's like all right like Porsche this is gonna be number one let's start Richard Jordan dewara she just Alexander  look I mean no more the world launcher shots man I he does he he flings like he's been playing 18 minutes of game over the past five games 12 points again John say Porter  is giving you sometimes 0 points but the skills and blocks are pretty good plays absolutely nothing like his brother Michael Porter I mean you could not be farther from playing like someone you related to then Jonathan Michael Porter I think John de Porter's torn is ACL at least twice so it's a little bit limited you know not that he was never the prospect he was never like the type of prospect that the mpj was but yeah I mean here's one of those guys that just had like an ultra tragic college career which by the way look into this I don't have all the numbers in front of me but like Michael Porter has I think he has like four or five siblings maybe more and like all of them have had crazy injury issues that they're just like a family flagged by by knee problems I have heard about that I actually can shag and I talked about John Deere Porter last pod and I was like didn't he wasn't he like day-to-day with a knee injury for an entire year the answer is yes because I wrote 18 jaunty Porter notes during his rookie year basically just saying out Tuesday out Wednesday out Thursday out Monday  anyway  this this is a deep League Man 9 cat daily  I feel like you're going to it's it's  with the Celtics might rest guys down the stretch right so that's kind of what your argument is for the for Prichard and Cornett which is  the Celtics lately have been listing a lot of guys this questionable going into certain games and usually one of them sits out one to two and then the other two maybe three will play um we know that porzingis is pretty injury prone and sits out a lot and Horford doesn't play back to back so sit out a lot  so I would lean Cornett to an extent because there are going to be minutes where games where he's just gonna play a lot of minutes because they have no other bigs really other than like a couple of guys the end of their bench  as far as where and Porter that's just what you need category wise it just comes down to that and to be honest  you know not defense walk on there's too much these guys are all so different players that to me it just comes down to what do you need a categories wise  yeah  um you know I for this week's specifically I think I would lean toward the Boston guys four games versus three games Pritchard to me is probably the safest as far as not missing any games or having the highest like minutes floor night to night you know Boston is kind of going into some like late season load management mode if you've been paying attention over the last few games like tonight they will not have drew holiday out there so that should be a nice boost for Payton Pritchard they won't have a Horford tonight they want to say I'm Hauser Tatum's questionable Brown's questionable forzest on the report like I think this is gonna be pretty common for the Celtics the rest of the way and this week now that they basically have the one seed in the East locked up so I would go Payton if I have to choose one of those guys I would go Pritchard first I guess maybe cornet by default I mean again Noel Horford tonight and they have a back-to-back coming up over the weekend so Horford's missing at least two of those games and cornette you know it's a cornette's numbers  are not that much different than jante Porter who was played I guess a few more minutes here and there but again lately coordinates basically been locked into like 15 to 20 minutes and I think I want the four games for Boston as a supposed to the three from Toronto by the way so I dug up something on the the porter injuries as a family this is from October of 2018 so I think there's been more since then like Michael Porter's had at least one back surgery since this point pretty sure John Deere Porter's had another injury since 2018 as well but at the time  Dante Porter had torn his ACL and MCL Michael Porter had had two back surgeries and played in two games in his entire career at Missouri  his sister Cierra had multiple knee surgeries and medically retired his sister Brie  five torn ACLs medically retired  I've torn five torn acos  that's like more than Jabari Parker and Derek Rose combined that's crazy five so that was so this this is why you know we talked about like well we Michael Porter slipped in the draft you know and PJ and you're like how is he slipped this far it's you know we I forget who said it someone said they got a report of reporter said they talked to a team and that that team said it was the worst medical they had ever seen on any Prospect ever  and PJ yeah yeah because they do take into account family history when when athletes when it's an athlete family yeah I mean when you have like 12 tornado family members yeah it's actually been as healthy as he has and I mean  it's the career that Michael Porter Jr had is also strange because I mean you remember him as a prospect right like it was not oh this guy would be a nice like three-point shooter role player it was like this guy wants to be Jayson Tatum and thinks he's Jayson Tatum  yeah this guy's gonna be like Carmelo but better yeah like it's gonna be like what if Carmelo sprayed from three all the time yeah  but if you what if you mixed Carmelo Anthony with Hassan Whitesides vision  that's what  if you have 12 its 12 ACL if you  have 12 AC L's in 12 generations of your family that's a lot  but yet yeah I don't even know if I like know somebody personally who's touring their ACL and I'm sure I do it's just nobody come like none of my immediate friends have had like we play we play a ton of basketball played you know in high school and college and whatnot  nobody I mean five the same person here five times  my goodness all right enough of that well hit a few more these and we'll be on our way out a little bit of speculation here but Billy says do you think Jalen Brown plays four games this week I I would say it's less likely that he does you know if you set the line at like three and a half I would take the under  so questionable for tonight against the Piston's so that's already that's already questionable then they play the Bucks and they played Detroit again and then Chicago  back to look I think back-to-back I would not be surprised if he sat out I would not be surprised to be Sarah tonight and Friday  so keep that in mind and then all the the Celtics about to go on a really long road trip  so I don't know if that's gonna play into it all but I would consider that they're about to go on a six-game road trip  so maybe they want him fresh for that  yeah I just I don't see that happening I mean I don't think that we're looking at like a shutdown or anything but they're nine and a half up in the East you know they've already yeah he's already missed what two of the last three games like you said he played Detroit twice I can't imagine he plays both of those so  yeah I know it's technically a four game week for jail brown but I would probably treat it as a as a three game week and then you know go from there  all right Daniel said in addition to Mercy of the fantasy Hoops Gods you gents offered solid streaming advice to allow me to be to Juggernaut and last week's semis all right there we go Daniel we'd love to hear it that's the luck in the finals this week  drehle 28 says Jalen Duren against Boston tonight or Nas read against the Jazz in a points league so we're kind of looking at a one-night streamer here not necessarily a streamer I guess but just you know somebody to put in the lineup tonight and as read or Jalen Duren  I would say we gotta wait and go bare right before we we fire up Nazarene  yes  but all so  not read against the Jazz  I mean that's that's pretty nice  I don't think Taylor Hendricks or John Collins is going to be guarding nazreen very well  and it we've seen read to have some big games without gobert  Duran against Boston that's not that's not an easy matchup and he's a 2020 monster but porzingis is gonna play that might pull him out its 3-point line tough team I mean that they can go down by 40 with that surprise anybody during the safest option but I actually think the upside option is not read  okay all right I don't have anything else to add there because the only other time they played Boston this season was that we are game when it was you know they almost beat him when they were on the losing Street yeah I think they went to overtime during that 15 and 14 but it needed 40 minutes to get there so yeah I think you're right to  kind of look at the porzingis matchup as like I'm not saying Dairy can't handle it but it might not be like the best rebounding upside type of matchup for Duran and I think if go parents have Sitting tonight that I would go nazreen that's that's like two gospel most  Joseph says do you believe that a stream of lowry for his assistance deals out ways the negatives he could bring you this week  16 Team league all right so we're at least in the right size League to to be talking about Kyle Lowry nine cat head to head  oh well  Kyle Lowry you know it is what it is at this point deals that every now and then pick it up some fouls you know he had four files the other night it gets Charlotte schedule wise this week for for Philly and it is a four game week so you have that going for you  I mean I don't know it 16 Team league there's just not a whole lot out there so it sounds really unappealing but that's just kind of life on the waiver wire this time of year I mean I'm I'm almost always say maybe I use this parameter too much but if there's a guy who could get you 20 assists in a week  probably worth probably worth grabbing and starting and yeah same way you get you 20 system for steals that's a great week yeah you might not be giving you anything else really anywhere the field goal percentage sucks but  you know you got a way that a little bit I find stream for game week  all right we got a similar question to the jail and brown one we think a Derek white misses one of the upcoming back-to-backs includes on the severity of Sam Houser's ankle  not much on Hauser I mean they're they're brutal about pretty quickly for tonight you know obviously Celtics have a pretty huge cushion here to be cautious with him so tough to say you know that's day to day or game to game or what Derek white not on the injury report tonight  against Detroit they played back to back Friday Saturday they don't have another back-to-back until  games 80 and 81 if I'm counting correctly here so it's really just that that won back-to-back Friday Saturday against Detroit Chicago that you'd be worried about  yeah so I mean they Brown is questionable tonight Drew holiday is setting out I think ideally Boston just wants at least one of holiday or Derek white healthy so part of me thinks okay holidays out tonight  my guess is he plays another one of these upcoming games this week maybe in the back-to-back and then white gets one of the nights off and they just do that  yeah it's hard to say I mean so many like all these guys have been on the injury report Lately from you know Horford to porzingis to Tatum to Brown to White to Holiday it does feel like white has played the most of these guys despite being on the injury report you know like yesterday against Washington was his first absence in a long time like month and a half so I I think he's the guy that's probably most likely to be consistent like I think he plays more games the rest of the season and holiday does but I think what you're buying is there's basically gonna be like a rotation set up for it's like all right one of you guys are sitting tonight the other one will play the next night Tatum will take you off this night Brown you're in like I think the Celtics are  you know being cognizant of the NBA rest rules for one which I don't think any of these games are going to be on national TV specially the back-to-back Friday Saturday Detroit Chicago I will say I mean and this would be something that might come up for that Wednesday game against Milwaukee right I mean that might be one where they're they could only hold out so many guys  yeah which is why I think they're kind of doing this Carousel thing yeah  so that they can't get dinged and their team is good enough or if they hold out one of their starters it's like well it's not really ruining the product yeah well it actually it almost works out better for fantasy and like betting and stuff for the like if they're playing Detroit without Jalen brown or you're playing Chicago without Jayson Tatum  I kind of like it like it reduces like the dramatic blowout factor and you know gives a higher floor to guys like cornet and Payton Pritchard all right well wrap it up there great question as always guys good luck to everybody who's in the fantasy playoffs so specialty if you're in the finals this week we hope that you know we've given you some advice over the last like 21 weeks that have helped you get to this point Alex it's not looking great for us in the roadwire steak League the shanku injury final nail in the coffin for me it's gonna be gonna be another disappointing year on that front but you know success in other League's as well but it would be if it's nice to not be on the hook for a like 300 dollar steak dinner this year I heard the NFL won was hi let's say let's say there were some or say there's some Buzz about maybe Banning alcohol from the  who brought that that's not gonna happen you know look there's I expensive wines is a easy way to rack up the bill and you know it's borderline it I think that some people yeah well I think inflation you know as part of it as well if that is true actually gone undercovered here  look I got nobody but nobody to blame but myself for paying for Jared Jackson and Lauren barking and you know I should I should have known that the Grizzlies entire team would be injured 20 games into the year but we'll do some more you know kind of looking back on the season looking ahead in the coming weeks once the fantasy playoffs are over once we don't have so many good questions to answer you know we'll start looking ahead to next season talk in more playoffs things of that nature but we will be back next Monday we'll have the great doctor a on the Pod tomorrow I'll be with Brandon Kravitz Wednesday Dr Ray and Rick Thursday Alex Cannon coming to you on Friday
