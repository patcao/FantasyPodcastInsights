Sunday so Now's the Time smart bracket.io  well Alex we have more injury news to get to I will take complete responsibility for this you called me out on it last week you're like all right a couple weeks ago you said we don't have that many injuries pretty much everybody spent healthy except for a feed in lamelo  I just continue to be wrong yeah I was covering some news for us late last night and it's like Sunday night not that many games should be chill no Shanks leave it on a wheelchair City Bay tears is ACL you know we found out earlier in the weekend that Ben author in is gonna miss the rest of the season  I feel even more like an idiot because I was taking Victory laps last week and like oh yeah I traded Jared Jackson got rid of that problem I got a couple like monster games I'm like all right I'm making a charge in the stake League no no I am not and we should say we don't necessarily have a a full update on shengwen quite yet I am somebody that stays away from the gruesome injury videos so I was like kind of yeah I don't watch it as a journalist last night to to write the injury note and I'm like I kind of like what I open like I really don't want to see this guy's leg snap I will say it wasn't quite as bad as I thought you know it was more of an ankle issue at first you kind of couldn't really tell he was contesting to baptist the bonus in transition but either way you could hear on the audio feed you know shengwen using some expletives to to Define what was going on with his foot and ankle he'll of course undergo an MRI some x-rays we'll see what's next  gotta imagine I mean he's at least missing a couple weeks here right I mean like the best case scenario feels like it's a severe ankle sprain and you know it could be a break could be some tendons that are damaged I mean it wouldn't be surprising at all if he's just done for the year yeah that would not be surprising I mean I I saw the video I I saw the image that was sort of going around Twitter in terms of like the ankle look like it bent a little too far up for my liking up on the leg I yeah but I Echo what you're saying where if you get shengwen back at any point this season I think that's a win whether it's fantasy whether you're the Houston Rockets and at some point there is going to be an equation of look we're an 11th right now we have 29 wins to Golden State's 33 who's above us and if we're gonna they are probably gonna start ragging off some more losses here without shangoo and at some point they may just decide with a few weeks left in the season a couple weeks left in the season he was shot down regardless yeah I think he was on the on the outskirts of potentially being a shutdown candidate anyway right I mean Houston's sitting at 11th right now I don't believe they have any like major draft pick implications so I do think if he was healthy they probably plays out the season and what's you know going to end up being just kind of an average year for the Rockets but yeah I mean it's not like this is a team that's battling for you know the fifth seed in the Western Conference it's like if there's any risk whatsoever you shut them down you're playing for the future and kind of playing the long game anyway it was somebody as young as Shane good but that was that was brutal I know a lot of people in the chat were telling us last week you know they had two or three guys who've been victims of injuries and now you throw shanku and on top of that you know Sydney Bay not a top 70 guy top 50 guy even higher like shein but still another blow you know somebody who had stepped up of late with all the other injuries in Atlanta they called it a hyper extension last night initially since it's been announced by was that it is in fact an ACL tear for City Base so obviously he's out for the rest of this season and with a  being March 11th you know this is likely something that will impact him as far as the start of next season goes Atlanta you could get Jalen Johnson back as soon as Wednesday that's their next game you know he's kind of more of a day-to-day guy at this point but of course still without Trey young without on yakka and it's kind of a big deal for Fantasy I mean City babe prior to last night when he'd been averaging north of 35 minutes at night with all their injuries uh yes I mean it's  you know Atlanta you mentioned it getting hit by injuries Jalen Johnson has been banged up as missed two straight uh yeah I think they're gonna I mean hopefully we've been saying this for like four years hopefully this means more usage for DeAndre Hunter I don't know if that'll actually happen they've been going with like hey let's give you know let's give Garrison Mathews some more minutes and Vic crunchy is back so from like a fantasy perspective  I don't really know if there's gonna be a major beneficiary what's the Deep Bay out for the season maybe AJ Griffin can get in the rotation at some point he's been in the G League that's tough to say I do want to actually I want to I want to go back a little bit because we do we talked about Shane but we didn't really mention hey someone's got our start for him you know that's 30 35 minutes a game usage he's only missed one game this season so our sample is very small in terms of what happens you know when he sits out  part of me thinks hey they signed Jack land for a reason he hasn't been playing that much I also think they like Jabari Smith as a small ball fight but sort of what is what is your initial reaction to make it more minutes yeah I mean that's a decision that that was kind of in on last night you know we have some human input on our stat projections our minute projections and there's it's interesting in Houston because I think lansdale's the obvious guy right but the only other real Center on the roster other than Steven Adams who's not playing the season is boban and every team Bob odds on it's like you know every now and then he'll just pop in and play four minutes you know early in his career you'd have those runs where you sometimes you know creep up to like 15 minutes he just hasn't really been a part of this rotation at all this season so I don't I don't see a situation where it's like all right landale and Mariana's you're just splitting up 48 minutes a night now between you two I think lansdale's the obvious beneficiary I also I also think there's kind of a cap on a jock landale right I don't think he's stepping into 30 minutes at night you know I think you know maybe he moves from playing 13 to 17 minutes to like 22 to 25 which could still be really valuable you know in terms of points and rebounds and you hope you get a few blocks and threes out of him but I think the true beneficiary might be Jabari Smith as you alluded to is already playing big minutes so in terms of you know where his night tonight workload can go I'm not sure there's a huge you know jump up there I mean he's averaging like 35 a game already had a couple 40 minute Knights of late but I think it's more about you know where does the usage trickle down here because you know Shen is obviously near the top on that roster as far as guys who used possessions you got Jalen green you got banned Fleet you know maybe this is a few more shots for for cam Whitmore who will happily take those but I think we see more more small ball Jabari Smith and I think he inherits you know a lot of the what 17 shots a game essentially and even more possessions when you factor in the passing and the free throws from shangoo and so this makes me like to Barry Smith board down the stretch yeah I think if you're the Rockets you also want to try to just get Jabari Smith to do a little bit more he hasn't had to and that's fine like you have Fred Van Vleet and shangoo and running the offense Shailene green does this thing if Cam Whitmore come in and pop shots but I think you would like to get Jabari Smith tomorrow offensive development you know you mentioned usage as well looking up right now on our on-off Court stats page on RotoWire with shangoo and tari Eason also off the court who gets the biggest usage boost it is Jalen green who gets an eight percentage boost up to 34% usage when he's on the court 25 points and four assists for Jalen green so look I'm not going to stand here and predict like Jalen green 25 points a game from here the rest of the season but if you're looking for maybe a Buy Low candidate you know someone doesn't necessarily think there's going to be a correlation there there's a chance if you're attend team category League Jalen green like actually be under waiver wire might not be a bad pickup yeah and you mentioned earlier I mean shagun has missed almost no time this year only missed one other game that was February 10th against Atlanta and this injury occurred with like a minute left last night so it's not like we even had like a quarter or a half to see what Houston would do so it is somewhat of a guessing game you know looking ahead at the schedule for Houston assuming shangoo is out three more games this week they have a three game week next week and then a four game week to conclude the month of March so I I think you know in a deeper League I'll definitely try to go out and grab chocolate on someone of a speculative basis and just kind of see what this becomes I mean again we don't really have much of a road map here they don't have a ton of depth at Center you know Jeff Green would kind of be that other guy and you know we're not that interested in him for Fantasy but yeah I think Jabari Smith and Jalen green are probably the two biggest winners here which doesn't even feel like the right term when somebody's leaving on a wheelchair but nonetheless if you're a shengwen fantasy owner not great news  Paul chives in he said she couldn't just went down for me last night he's locked in at first place so he has the bye week for the first week of the playoffs that's good what do you think of the chances and bead comes back for week 22 oh go ahead no you go ahead please well okay yeah it depends what you know some League split the All-Star break or not so you're basically in either weak 20 or weak 21 right now so you're basically asking me like do I think it'd be will come back in the next two to three weeks my guess is no we did a fairly encouraging update last week that he was ramping up back he started on court workouts and he's 100% in the weight room which is great now what does that mean does that mean in beat squatting 400 pounds on his knee maybe not but I think look Shams charania said that he is expected to miss six to eight weeks guys like shops Chris Hayes woes are almost never wrong  and that's six weeks time table puts him at basically early April  and even if he does come back a little before that let's say he comes back last week of March what are the odds he's playing more than like 20 minutes a game for you and at that point someone else on your roster is probably gonna be giving you just as good if not better numbers so I don't think you should worry about potentially dropping and beat if you're if you're thin for IR spots yeah Phillies got to be careful too I mean this team is completely cratered as you'd expect without indeed and you know Maxie's missed time as well that certainly has not helped but they're they're down to six right now in the Eastern Conference and are only a half game up on Indy in a full game up on Miami for seventh and eighth so again I do you're obviously gonna prioritize jollibee's Health but there is  there are some emergency here I think what it comes to the Sixers because you were what third fourth in the East like three weeks ago and all the sudden now you're in grave danger of falling into the play in so and  I I would not drop it so where do you come in are you saying that you would you would drop him and try to stream that spot or are you with me like I think there's enough of a chance and obviously the upside is so colossal with indeed that if you could hold him I would still hold out hope until it's officially rolled out if like if you if you have too many injury reserves spots like if you're holding let's say you have two IRS and you're already holding two top 40 top 50 guys in there yeah I think you could drop in bead to be honest but if you're because he sang his second week of the playoffs is the is we 22 which it's gonna be two weeks from now for a lot of people so if that's your case you just gotta win you just gotta get through the playoffs fair enough fair enough Matt points out in the chat by the way Drew Holliday out tonight for the Boston Celtics some actionable news here Boston had its entire starting lineup on the injury report as of last night so holidays going to be out but Tatum Brown and Derek white will all play Chris Staples porzingis also sitting out it is the front end of a back-to-back for Boston so something to keep an eye out there  I can take my I can take my Derek white over blocks and it's a blocks and steals props tonight on the road warrior NBA Show on Sirius XM channel 86 I will say you mentioned the 76ers are struggling right now past four games they're averaging 98 points per game they scored what 76 or something last night  79 to 73 look at that as long as you're holding the next to 73 man brutal  all right we'll hit a few questions here as we moved through the Pod you know want to talk about some of the guys on the rise and a lot of the questions here I think will go hand in hand with players we want to talk about and we're  we're at the point in the year where we got to talk about Delano Benton and Scoot Anderson because with all the injuries and with you know everybody kind of scraping for Value this time of year these are relevant names Kenny asked Banton or scoot in a nine Cat 10 Team league his playoffs also begin in week 22 the band's really tough for me because he's been playing a ton of minutes he started four games in a row he played 42 minutes against a terrible Toronto team the other night you know the numbers have been pretty good the shooting is probably gonna be all over the place but really high usage player and you know we're basically night tonight with all of the regulars for Portland right Jeremy Grant you know eight and I know came back recently but he'd been out you know broaden probably don't see him again this year I don't know that we see shade and Sharpie there he's missed a ton of time  so I feel like with Banton  if you're in a daily lineup league and you could kind of  play the gonna kind of play the the odds I guess on who's out and a given night I like him a lot I think if you're locking him into a weekly lineup especially in a three game week there might be some nights when you get burned because you know who knows when Jeremy Grant is ran randomly going to play or Anthony Simon Says randomly gonna sit out yeah like we could all look at the past four games that he started and be like hey look man 36 minutes he played well but then before that there were two games where he played single digit minutes and look I yeah bands playing well I would still rather have school I scoot is a guy we're not talking about like Jeremy Grant who's a veteran or DeAndre who's a veteran sort of and might get shut down like scoot is someone that have obviously a lot of interest in developing and I think they would like to get him as many reps as possible I I would rather I would rather have school I know he's gonna kill your field goal percentage I know he's gonna kill your turnovers but there's like a 0% chance that scoot plays like nine minutes in a game that he's healthy and that that could happen to Banton now chances of it happening  get less and less as the season goes on but  yeah  another good Blazers question here for Daniel he says my team is more injured and seemingly outclassed in my current head-to-head playoff matchup looking to stream Max games played in an attempt to compete on can tell you're doing the right thing there is to money tomorrow a good grab for the Wednesday Thursday back to back set  yeah I mean you're kind of scrape at the bottom of the barrel but for good reason here they play Atlanta and New York so we like one of those matchups we don't love the other against the Knicks team that's been pretty good on defense and should be getting some pieces back soon and those are both home games for Portland maybe that's a slight bomb  I'm not I'm not super fired up about Kamara I would like to think at a 12 team League you might be able to do a little bit better but specifically  specifically for that back-to-back said I don't mind it 11 games this season he's played more than 30 minutes he's averaging about 11 points 7 boards one and a half steals 1.33 so I would say you know reasonably you times that by two and that's probably what you should be able to expect yeah I think it's not a lot of people say they're being outclassed and fantasy I do very big of you to say that  um Kamara yeah I mean I part of me thinks there's probably a better option on the way for wiring a 12 team League uh but if points like a sister excuse me if points and rebounds are what you need then it it's fine because that's all really cars doing for you it's gonna be pretty inconsistent  yeah I'm looking and Charlotte is another team that has a back-to-back Friday Saturday  yeah I mean the Pelicans have a Friday Saturday back to back so you know presumably this is a daily moves League where you can you know kind of jump around and Utah all so as a Friday Saturday back to back a couple of teams you know Portland to Dallas I believe oh no Portland Dallas in Chicago are the three teams with a Wednesday Thursday back to back  yeah I you know Chicago there's I don't know a 12 team is there anybody you really like you know Dallas  maybe Daniel gaffords out there at like we have to kind of go game to game with him still  yeah and I mean this week is actually pretty balanced from like a how many games are on a day of a week perspective so it's a pretty good week to stream in general um  but yeah I mean Chicago doesn't really have that many appealing options outside of the usuals  Drummond would not be a bad stream if he's available  yeah yeah I would check into drum end and again if somebody dropped Gafford you know he's now played 20 plus minutes in three straight so that trend has reversed a little bit you know as far as his minutes go he started to in a row had it's got eight blocks over his last three games but you know Derek Lively back in the mix now he missed the game against Detroit over the weekend so that's that's you know liable to change on a win for that Dallas front Court  Christopher says what are you feeling about Toronto everyone is out tonight thinking about streaming to Laura well you're right about that so quickly is out Gary Trent is out Chris Boucher who's playing well of late he's out yaakov portal Scotty Barnes they're all out RJ Barrett will be a game time call with an illness and Bruce Brown and also questionable as of right now Barrett's actually made upgrade to probable so does look like they'll have RJ Barrett  I mean this this is a skeleton crew for the Raptors and you know we talked a little bit last week about you know some guys you could benefit with no bars and Noble and  we're kind of going through the same song and dance with the Juarez last year where it's like a minister there yeah he has a chance to score like 25 on any night you know he is a trucker and we don't necessarily mean that in a bad way for fantasy kind of reminds me like a Sadiq Bay type of player I think if those minutes were there hasn't played a ton of minutes he played only 15 total minutes the last two games but you know with so many guys out I think that probably changes tonight so I don't I don't mind it you know I think you have to live with the potential downside here and it's a pretty rough matchup at Denver  tough matchup they are 16.0 dogs although that may actually help a noira if it gets out of hand you might just go up and shock yeah you second with noira because per 306 basically I mean this season's averaging 187 and 3 so he could play 36 minutes tonight who knows it's the point for Toronto where you know we have an on-off Court stats on our daily lineups page and wrote a wire and you can click it and get kind of a quick heads up on who gets increased usage it just says we don't have data for that there's too many guys out like it's gotten to that point it's like this just doesn't even he's live up combinations don't actually exist no more again is fine there is still a chance he might only play 20 minutes it's almost impossible to predict I mean I wish we had better answers for you but a guy like a bhaji actually gave a decimal to run to Freeman Liberty the other day yeah I feel a little bit safer  all right we continue to navigate through the weeds here Matt says would you drop heart and Stein for either Olynyk or Nick Richards in a head-to-head points League it's in the semifinals of his playoff matchup I I think so it partially it depends on of course what categories you need and you know some of the the league settings here but it's a three-game week for the Knicks and it's a four-game week for both Toronto and Charlotte  so again it depends you know do you have the ability to make moves night to night is there a games limit things like that but if you're just looking at it from a gameplay perspective yeah you know hard science numbers have been down lately both the Linux and Richards have outperformed him so I would say yes the question is do you go with the Linux or you go with Richards  Yeah you mentioned Harvest Time has been down with that Achilles injury Nicks are playing I got a horrible Pace lately  I mean look Olynyk is the better family player equal and all the next one playing significant minutes lately  and they gave him an extension but Toronto needs to lose games to keep their draft pick and I would worry about an old Linux shut down at some point  mysterious injury whatever it is so that that does make me prefer Richards even though he's a big inconsistent  but look over the course of a week three games he'll get you he'll get you decent numbers he'll get you you know that that 10 and 8 with a block average that you need but if you need pure upside like this week I think I would just go all the Nick but if you're if you're concerned longer term yeah Richards I will say if we need to break the tie here I like the schedule a lot more for Charlotte at Detroit tonight at Memphis on Wednesday Phoenix Friday Philly Saturday I mean you got three really good matchups there and then Phoenix is a little tougher whereas Toronto plays at Denver at Detroit and then two against Orlando which is been a really slow pace good defensive team to end the week so I think that would push me slightly in favor of Nick Richards  Brian says Tyler here coming back at all  good question  I think so I think he should come back he's he didn't play last night to get the Wizards that was what eight missed games in a row this is becoming a little bit more concerning they don't play again until Wednesday on the play Friday and Sunday those are two Road games have Detroit in three days  you know we're probably won't get an update on here oh until at least tomorrow maybe even Wednesday morning so if you have to make that decision now I would say hold him out here line up you know specially in the three game week for Miami but you know this is not a team that like Toronto we're worried about trying to lose games so I don't think they will take this longer than they need to it's a bit weird you know because he was dealing with a knee injury and then now he's dealing with a foot injury yeah it's sort of it looked like the hyper extended his knee and now he's dealing with what they're calling right foot medial tendonitis  so it's kind of hard to discern I assume the knee injuries fine now and that's it's the foot but um yeah unfortunately we don't have any more information about like there's there's gonna take a day to day yeah Brian also says he's dropping Royce sonal and Isaiah hardenstein who should he pick up in a tent team nine cat had to head League keyonte George Simone fontecchio Jacqueline Dale and Thompson or Aaron Nesmith  um  cancer George has been pretty good lately  10 straight starts averaging 17 points 5 assists  solid percentages has been killing it from three  you know we talked we talked about landale earlier so I don't want I don't want to do a whole Spiel on that that's kind of Uncertain do you have what do you think about fun Techo Ahmed Smith well I think the case for fontecchio is that Detroit I believe is the socks also has no excuse me I'm looking at the wrong page here Detroit I believe is the only of these teams that has four games this week so keep that in mind again always depends on what how the moves work in your league but these are all different players but comparable you know there's a reason you're considering all them for this spot fontecchio has got 220 plus point games in his last three you know a lot of it is going to hinge on you know as you go in one for three for three years you go on five for 12 like you get the other night against Miami so you have to live with that it is a category league so the threes do help you there quite a bit I do still think you know in a vacuum it's probably key update George for me I mean he too has had two great games in his last three it to me it just comes down to the schedule you know do you want four out of five hecky or do you want three out of George can you take it game to game can you kind of alternate between those two but in terms upside I think it has to be key update George and speaking of the Jazz by the way  I'm a little concerned I'm a little concerned about what's going on here they brought in Darius basally our old pal as well as kind of lofting on you know these non-ge deals that makes me worried about Taylor Hendricks and it makes me worry even more about Larry marketing  it does suspicious moves by the Utah Jazz let's say  yes taeler Hendrix who is we haven't really gotten an update on you know on March 5th I said he'll get at least a week we haven't gotten anything since then dealing with a toe injury those have various the timelines on toe injuries are all over the place yeah and then yeah marketing who has missed three straight  and we don't have an update for him for tomorrow's game yet  it's quad injury it's about all we know but yeah if I again we've talked about another pods if you have marketed and you can trade him for comparable value you just do it  but it gets hard it's gets more difficult every every game that he sits out  yeah Jazz are I'm saying they're out of the play in mix right now and I don't think they care they have worse record in the NBA actually a force record Toronto is is creeped up on that so they have draft pick implications to worry about I don't know if they're going to succeed in that but they'll probably at least try to maximize their chances  we knew about marketing being a risk for a while and I think every you know with each passing week it becomes more more concerning and you kind of learned to read between the lines on some of these late season signings got a question about I'm at Thompson in terms of you know can he pick up any value with shanku and injured um you know first of all I'm looking at is basketball reference page is middle name is xlnc just for Capital City  oh wow and everybody put that together that's awesome you do this  I did know this I thought you knew this no I should have known this I feel bad that I didn't you know the interesting thing with the men you know it's like he's he's usually listed as what shooting guard maybe you see him as a small forward he's playing almost 60% of his minutes at the three this year according to basketball reference but about 15% of his minutes have come at the four you know I don't think we see like an ultra small ball line up where he's playing Center but there could be some trickle down effect here  I yeah I I think you know for me he's not like a priority pickup but it is interesting I will say I'm keeping you have to monitor it because they could go more Jabbar E Smith and then slide up ah Men Who  look he's  he's a really unique player he's not really like shengwen at all but is he someone that could hang out at the top of the key  do some dribble handoffs do some pick-and-roll as the passer or the playmaker I think he could we know that he can't so  I would have I would not be surprised if he started getting like 28 minutes a game as a post to like 20 minutes a game keep an eye and he's one of those guys regardless of role it's like you just you just want the minutes right like whenever he whenever he sees big minutes he's gonna give you defensive stats more than anything he rebounds at a ridiculous rate for a guy of his size you know both the and his brother are like that you know in games where he's played at least 27 minutes this year he's averaging 10 rebounds so it could be that simple right where it's not like all right he's gonna play center with Shango now but it's like you gotta replace 30 to 35 minutes in that rotation and if even five to seven of those go to I'm at Dobson each night I think that would be a huge help so yeah he gets a boost as well we probably should have mentioned him earlier when we were talking about Jabari Smith manolo's Most Wanted says ogn and Nobby are you still holding him  nicer taking this one day today you know almost a week ago they said he was fully cleared for basketball activities he played some five on five last week did not play last night against the Sixers they're off tonight and then the next play Tuesday against Philly Thursday in Portland Saturday in Sacramento  barring some sort of setback Alex I would expect and nobody to play in one of those games  I think so I think if you've held them this long don't drop him now because he's officially day to day now and everything sounds like it's going well so yeah hang on to him play soon all right we got a Wizards question Corey kispert or Bilal coulibaly for this four-game stretch for Washington so we will go back to the schedule here Washington's off tonight they're at Memphis at Houston at Chicago and then home for Boston on Sunday  not a great schedule not a disaster wouldn't call it a plus yeah I blindly I would say Corey kisper I've just I have not been a huge cooler Bali guy even when the minutes have been there for him it's just been a little underwhelming you know you're really pinning yourself to some defensive stat upside whereas I think Pittsburgh is gonna give you a higher floor night to night he is a little bit 3 point to pendant he had been a pretty huge slump prior to last night against Miami when he had five threes but I would still lean kisper  this bird's minutes have been more inconsistent okay I agree with Nick I like his upside more um he's actually decent rebounder and decent Pastor like sometimes you'll get zero sometimes we'll get five but he's at least throwing them in there it's kind of the same thing with cool Bali so I would I would couch it the same way Nick said where it's if you need offense go kiss Bert if you need defense go go cool Bali yeah and he he follows up and says he'd be dropping Trey man to do this  I think he kind of have to right now this late in the year I mean he's missed two games they say he's unlikely to play tonight so it almost certainly be three  I mean keep in mind that if you know when that happens you becomes IR eligible but I just I don't know if you could play the waiting game the night to night game with someone who's ultimately relatively low upside and man and we're talking about the Charlotte Hornets so when they say doubtful that means out and when they say questionable that means doubtful we saw this with Mark Williams we've seen this with other guys we saw this with lamelo when they called him doubtful and then ruled him out for like a two months and like the day after um so yeah it's that's a fine move  Daniel asks with Sadiq Bay out for the season is DeAndre Hunter a must own rest of season this is in a 10:00 yeah if you're just tuning in saddiq Bey torn ACL done for the year you know well likely impact him at the beginning of next year as well I yeah in a 10 team or you know it's a little more borderline but I think just just based on the sheer number of minutes that are going to be available I think you gotta grab DeAndre Hunter keep in mind that Jalen Johnson is likely back in the next few games I don't necessarily view him as like a shutdown candidate I think when he's ready he'll be back in there so he'll be able to backfill a lot of what bay is giving up but City a was playing close to 40 minutes a lot of nights and you know Jalen Johnson is not gonna grab all those so yeah if it's a yes or no question I would say yes I want DeAndre Hunter  I do too yeah he sees a  5% usage bump with Trey young and Sadiq Bay off the court that's enough combined with the minutes and look yes you're right Daniel he's only giving you points like that's really what he's in there doing yeah from a fairy perspective but that's sometimes there's just what you need  yeah and threes which are of course valuable I mean almost two and a half makes per game over his last 15  let's see another question here more streaming dilemmas would you drop Andrew Wiggins for a Indie Memphis or Sacramento player who has a Tuesday Wednesday back to back waiver wire slim so our question asker says he may be targeting op topping or Jake laravia so that's time of year man uh Camden and I talked a little laravia on the Friday pod  doing a little more self-creation this year you know last year all of every basket of Arabia made was assisted this year it's like basically half so he's doing a lot more creation I look I don't trust anybody on Memphis as far as I can throw them I think we've said that plenty of times just in terms of all the injuries but he's been playing well so and toppin yeah math runs out for the year top and get a little more usage here there  but  I'm not I'm not really a topping guy I just he's doing a lot of his work in transition he's not really involved in the half court offense besides shooting some Corner threes I'd rather have Lavia and I'm fine dropping Wiggins for laravia to be honest yeah I think with Memphis I mean things reached a fever pitch last night because I mean there were out all the all the usuals plus Watanabe you know Brandon Clarke Is Yet To Come Back Jordan Goodwin John conchar Vince Williams you know guys who have mostly been available despite all these other injuries so I think laravia got a little bit more of a bumping normally what I mean he made his first career MBA start last night probably would have played more than 24 minutes had he not been in battle trouble so that's something to keep an eye on but Memphis there in that handful of teams where it's just night tonight you have absolutely no idea he was going to be available sometimes Jaron Jackson plays other times he doesn't sometimes five guys are randomly out sometimes they're not so you know take it with a grain of salt be cautious but you know For an upcoming back to back I don't think I mind it good question here on meech you know Daniel says I've been patiently waiting on the number one waiver wire priority All Season how high are you guys I'm associate meat Church rest of season is it worth picking him up and holding in case someone drops a true stud  yeah I you know I had to make the kind of depressing decision to go big on beach in a couple weeks over the weekend I think if you think Trey man's going to continue to miss time I'm okay burning it on bitch you know because you there's a pretty good chance you might hold on to that waiver priority and then just never use it you know I don't I don't know who would really be dropped where you would you would feel like it's a complete home run you know you could have somebody you just like rage quits your league and just drops all their guys which I have seen on Twitter so there's that possibility but then the commission may be steps in  yeah I mean it especially if you're in a deeper League I know this is a 12 team or  the waiver wire Is A Wasteland this time of year and yeah I think if three man continues to miss time I don't think we see them hello again I mean meet you could very easily be like I don't know you know 13 7 and 5 type of guy the rest of the way was some steals  yeah I mean that the fact that he's 30 makes me like a little cautious you know what the way this with you know Charlotte's Charlotte's horrible and so there's always the shutdown brisk but like Nick said tremend  they listen to us doubtful that's not encouraging for the Hornets so should you burn it  you know me just basically been giving you since he got to Charlotte he's basically been giving you 10 and 5 10 points five assists recently he's giving you 15 and 5 so I think you have to ask what are the chances that someone comes up on the waiver wire who's giving you a pretty consistent like 10 to 15 points with five assists not that many guys come up with the assists so I would be fine burning that all right we got a good non-fantasy question from from Manila Most Wanted he says what is your feedback for the Lakers being featured every ball game by the media they are mediocre this season  well you know  I don't really mind it necessarily you know I think we have to keep in mind what's what's the priority for these National TV games which is what I assume you're talking about  Lakers are a huge Market they have the biggest name player in the NBA they have another huge star Anthony Davis who had a ridiculous game last night by the way and yes they may be mediocre  but there are some of something on the line here right you know it's not like we're talking about a team that's that's season is over and they're just playing out the string you know this isn't the New York Giants or the Jets being featured on Monday Night Football every week  There's still to be there still some level of Entry like Kendall Lakers climb out of the plan so you know can they can they get to that succeed right now which they're they're two games back up after winning last night I yeah I don't have a big problem with it I like watching the Lakers maybe I'm in the minority you know I'm a LeBron guy but if you're not a LeBron guy I could see why this would be very annoying uh yes I mean it's I think it was happening before LeBron got there like any team that LeBron is on is gonna get this kind of media but that gets all so the Lakers so maybe you should actually be happy that it's just one team getting all the attention rather than two teams getting yes outlandish media attention but no they still would have gotten the attention or they still did get the attention when it was like the lounge a ball branding Ingram Julius Randle era  all that stuff and then would have if they just still been bad it just kind of is what it is unfortunately that's a great point because yeah the Lakers are going to be on no matter what and it's like Aaron Rodgers going to the Jets like the Jets are gonna get a couple of those big games anyway and then you just pour gasoline on the fire by throwing Rogers on that roster and that's really exactly what we've done with LeBron and the other thing is the Lakers play a lot of late games right there's it's often you know there's not when you have like a 10-game slate what usually what six or seven games at least are in the early window so just by virtue of being in the Pacific time zone they're gonna play more these late games you know on national television and you know if you're a network and you're saying all right should we put the Lakers on or the Sacramento Kings or you know the Houston Rockets or whoever it may be I think that becomes a pretty easy decision I I would love to and there's a million reasons why they probably don't do this but I would love to for there to be kind of like these built-in Flex games where you know later this season the specialty you know you have the option of like all right it could be a fan vote it could be whatever the teams with the best combined record like whatever that game is that goes on national TV  yeah I agree it also helps you know at least the Lakers are in like a good division so the chance of you like seeing a good game or are very high yeah very very true I mean last night fun game despite Minnesota you know being down both gobert and Karl Anthony towns you know 80 had an all-timer I want to talk about some other other late season risers late season targets you know we hit a ton of them you know via the questions here because you know so many of those were great at kind of hitting on players who are relevant right now but you know Utah as a team that I kind of wanted to go back to because I am worried about the market and shut down what they did over the weekend you know Taylor Hendricks like you said we haven't really had much in terms of updates  and it's just a really really troubling situation because there are very few obvious villains here right I mean George and kind of already been getting the minutes we've seen more out of Sexton lately you know Collins and Clarkson are two guys he would think would be shut down candidates and yet they continue to play Big minutes but I mean have you in deep religious if you like you know shown any interest in like the price sensible balls of the world  yeah I  am very good question I look I've tried to avoid like thank you goodbye too much but you'd have to it's I think sensible you know sensible has played 30 minutes back to back to back games and as been pretty involved so that's something to take a look at you know you always think like is Taylor Horton Tucker coming back you never know how much are they really going to play David Roddy I just don't think any of these guys are  going to be fantasy difference makers let's look at that way like if you talk comes up on a four-game week I think a lot of these guys are going to be viable streaming options like if you're 16 Team league and you just need to stream guys in and everybody's fighting over a bunch of people and you put like eight waivers just to make sure you get a guy  there's a good chance you're gonna have like one or two Jazz guys on that list but I don't know anybody's gonna be different maker  yeah I'm just I'm looking at some guys who you know if you isolate the last two weeks you know I've really made big jumps yeah this guy's owned I would think and just about any league but not read I think deserves a little pop here you know made his first start of the season last night 25 points five boards three assists four blocks he's got 12 made threes over the last two games so if you are playing in like a 10-year and he's not out there I don't think they go Bears injury is long term but obviously they're going to be without cat for a while so yeah anything you can do if that's where he just wasting away on a bad team you know maybe throw an offer out there try to grab him because I think he's I think he's gonna be really valuable the rest of the season and you know maybe they're a little bit careful with gobert I don't know how much you know getting the the one seed in the west really matters to Minnesota as opposed to being a healthy as they can be yeah I would also look into Kyle Anderson who there's a there's a better chance Kylie Anderson is not roster and your league look don't expect anything crazy but he's yes you know be can give you eight five and five here and there  and get you some Steals and blocks nickeil Alexander Walker someone who he filled in I think last night with Kyle Anderson or Kyle Anderson missing time played 39 minutes  if they decide to try to preserve Conley a little bit here and there  to kill Alexander Walker's guy could benefit and then they signed TJ Warren and he played 23 minutes the other night but I'm just I'm not ready to even talk about that to be on us  yeah that's gonna take weeks I think of preparation to prepare us to talk about TJ Warren Daniel says enough about us how are you guys feeling about your fantasy matchups this week thank you for the thoughtful answers and good luck Nick and Alex thank you Daniel appreciate that  well I lost Shane gun in my two most important leaks so I'm not feeling great you know I am getting Devin Booker back and one of those so that'll be nice still holding Julius Randle and an eel spot so once we get him back in the mix I'll be feeling okay I've been able to tread water but I mean it's gonna be a massive massive loss I am going up against somebody who has a beat though so I feel okay about that one but what about you yeah the stake League just kind of a slog All Season Miss Simons at the start of the year it's a Rota league so it's not it's not you know it's not a it's not a playoff situation oh gee a nobby was big for me got hurt Spencer Dinwiddie was in and out for me that got destroyed Daniel Gafford was big for me that got destroyed  so that's pretty rough and then the keeper League I just pulled the plug so looking towards next season and then nfkc just didn't go that well in general not a disaster just just not gonna cash this year yeah I'm I'm still trying to push and NFC I you know have it lamelo is just you know put it right really put a ceiling on what my team could be and you know in a league like that you're just you're never going to find somebody who's like oh great I'll just you know drop the Bellow and be just fine like there's just nobody that was gonna replicate what he gives me and the way I built my team was you know factoring in that he probably plays you know I was prepared for him this time wasn't prepared for him to play like 22 games on the year pretty tough to win any League when when you're 13th overall pick or whatever it was is it giving you much but yeah stakely I think I'm I think I'm gonna have to wave the White Flag there I think had Shanks State healthy would have been really interesting down the stretch but I also have Marketing in that league and the way things are trending with him like I would I would need marketing to play like himself and play at least 90% of the game the rest of the way to to really have a chance so even after losing shanku and you know I don't you know I didn't feel like all that great about my chances to to charge up the standings you know what I think I took Market in  that was an auction league but I marketed I believe was my second highest price by  behind Damian Lillard which was just tough because Lillard started to play well now it's like I was not feeling great about that for the first half of the season and all the time now I'm getting you know like basically end of round one value out of Lillard and as that's happening we lose Shane goon and marketing and you know kind of starts back in his way out I will say we don't we don't really talk about the article that much on this on
