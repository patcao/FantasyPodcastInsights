welcome everybody to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy Vivid Seats and rival fantasy it is Friday November 10th 2023 Alex barutha here with Shannon McEwen and Ken k train Crites all aboard  as always we're gonna start things off by jumping straight into the news and this probably could have this entire new section is cooking an injury section just injuries Galore we have Cam Thomas out for two weeks we have Tyler hero out a couple of weeks Jamal Murray out three weeks Walker Kessler out two weeks and I know there's somebody out there watching this video that drafted all of those guys is now losing their fantasy league at Camp Thomas like 75% of my teams that's for sure yeah I mean Ken so cam Thomas has hurt like you don't drop him but know what do you what are you looking at doing with him out now do you think there's a move to make for for the Nets we do have Cam Johnson coming back presumably tonight so that that does maybe take away some value yeah um well obviously gonna talk about a lot of free agent guards in our waiver wire section but yeah you have to stash Thomas I mean how many could score 35 points a night guys are out there you know  right there's not that many  um Shannon what do you again without spoiling too much of it the waiver wire section or do I need these other injuries stand out to you in terms of like is there you don't drop these guys but pickups what do you think is kind of going to happen here what are you worried about  yeah I mean with Cam Thomas I mean two weeks I think it's manageable you keep them stashed on your bench unless you are in a very shallow League you know if you're in a league where top 100 players are widely available then there could be something to consider with Cam Thomas but for the most part you know two weeks is manageable right stash on your bench you know the Brooklyn Nets it'll be interesting what happens once Thomas does return because cam Johnson is expected to make his season debuted tonight so that rotation could be is going to be different once Tampa's returns with Jamal Murray you know I believe you got you got Reggie Jackson since the obvious pick up we might discuss him more during our waiver wire pickups Walker Kessler that's tough I mean you would have thought the clinic Kelly Olynyk was the most obvious plug-in but the Jazz decided to switch things up slide columns and marked in up to the foreign and the five  so it will discuss the Jazz as well during our waiver wire pickups the heat is kind of the interesting one you've got  Ken's favorite Kyle Lowry you know any player who's over the hill can is a must add and large bottom yeah large bottom I forgot that that's actually number one it's large bottom then over the hill big Bumpus  Yeah well yeah well we'll talk about more big bumpuses later but Ken why don't why don't we touch on some of the two games that happened last night well and I know you were on the edge of your seat for all of this but Giannis scored 54 last night but had two costly turnovers late in the fourth quarter when he was just gasped in the Bucks 126 124 loss at Indianapolis coach Adrian Griffin got tossed its complete trying to protect Giannis was complaining about the lack of foul calls on youngest Defenders  and no Dave Miller has got a catfish you I think that's just day to day but hey these are your bucks Alex  give us some more insights on this yeah this game started off pretty badly as all bucks games do at this point and eventually they the Bucks just gave up trying to run real offense and just gave the ball the honest against the Pacer second unit I might add and just said go crazy man like just just fix it for us and then the they pulled him because he got gas and then they put Chris Middleton in and Chris Middleton looked completely on guardrail for four or five minutes and then got himself and then the game you know continue to slip away I was amazing throughout the whole game but you mentioned it like he he turned the ball over late I watched I was very locked into the last five minutes of this game and he it just it was those youngest mistakes that you see a lot where he spins into traffic he keeps the ball to low and set a high the offense kind of bogs down guys aren't cutting so yet another disappointing loss for the Milwaukee Bucks  after they almost drop a game to Shannon's Detroit Piston's with youngest giving ejected like to be honest as post-game tweet you know he scored 54 he tweeted 54 45 it doesn't matter a lot of good things we can learn from today to get better  yeah Shannon we also had some interesting box scores from this game we had Myles Turner and bennedict mathurin play 37 and 36 minutes respectively after basically previously like their mechanics have been down 25 through like the minutes have been a little all over the place what do you make of this  yeah I mean with Ben math in particular I find it very encouraging that's back-to-back games you know 38 minutes and 36 I'm back to back nights as well yeah and big outings in each and he topped 40 fancy points in each outing love to see it especially after his up and down start to the season you know he's locked in as the starter as shooting guard but it's just great to see him get over 30 minutes I mean those are the first two games of the Season where he's played over 30 minutes if he continues to play over 30 minutes then anyone who identified him as breakout candidate you know that you should start to reap those rewards moving forward yeah similar it was that they played four guys over 36 minutes on the second of a back-to-back but it was they won  yeah well hey the Pacers trying to win games like this is this is not a team that believes that they are below 500 or they're or they're really rebuilding they want to make the playoffs so well you know proof of that Alex we saw the return of Daniel theis his first appearance got four eight minutes showcasing him for the clip maybe I will say what one thing to know with Myles Turner as well because he only played 23 minutes the previous night he also you know is only only top 30 minutes three times this season three out of nine games but last night Jalen Smith said out he was kind of a unexpected last minute scratch for that game so that opened up some minutes and they really needed Myles Turner to step up and and he did he had a great game the big old Obi top of a fan so out there he was notably not the one starter not to get big minutes in fact only played 13 in looked a little lost on defense I would say I'm not I'm not on the toe the top in bandwagon I've I've cut bait there in a couple weeks where I've asked him he was stuck on my bench anyways but even even games you know if you're watching closely and there'll be games will start off he'll hit his first couple shots it happened last night actually I think he might have scored like two of the first four buckets for the Pacers and then immediately it doesn't matter it doesn't matter he gets pulled off the court for five minutes in the game and ends up only playing 13 to 14 minutes and and can't do much on the fantasy side so if you know this the team that they've loved playing nice Smith at the at the at the four they've got Walker the rookie Walker that can eventually might make his way into the rotation I think he'll be toppings  just it's time it's time to find a replacement if you still rostering him  oh we had the Mexico City game last night between the Hawks and Magic the Hawks win this one 120 to 1:19 was an excellent game I feel like both teams were really hyped up for this game the crowd was going insane a lot of these plays it's a really fun game of course before we get to the extremely pertinent fantasy information we have to know that Joe Ingles plus 27 and 18 minutes I mean that was just Oddity I loved it more relevant for your fantasy teams we had Mark Hill folds back in the lineup after missing some time he was fine Jalen Suggs big game for him probably the best games of his career 21 points on 10 shots six steals for him of course he one of the best defenders in the NBA one of the best deal next food before every game he's drinking harito and sugar was a junk that Isaac have his best game of the season 12 points 7 boards two blocks in 16 minutes  the vogner but not say minutes split kind of continues if you picked either one up it's fine but you know you're not you're not two blocks butts yeah it was good to see but yeah and then Trey young goes for 41 and 8 with three steals Ken what's the most notable thing that you kind of draw from this game all of the Joe Ingles hey Jonathan Isaac is he actually back I mean he's on my he's on our waiver wire chat coming up but wow a healthy job is Jonathan Isaac is something people have dreamed about for three or four years I can't imagine he's gonna stay healthy but my goodness  it's worth taking a flyer on if you got some bent space  in a very deeply yeah the the issues going to be playing with Jonathan Isaac right you know 16 minutes last night he has looked good when he's able to play they're still kind of He said Out previous game well for us 16 minutes two blocks solid player we know what he can do we know what he can do but  I think 14 teamers it's got to be pretty deeply for me to pick him up I mean the biggest takeaway is sucks you know even with folks coming back so Gary Harris was out but aunt black played 17 minutes off batch folks leading the guard rotation with 31 minutes and those seven there are those six deals and four three-pointers you know if you took sucks with a late Dart in your draft this is this why you did so so I love seeing him getting that run well we've we've talked about it enough let's get to the waiver wire section but first a word from our friends at Underdog Underdog fantasy is the number one platform for MBA best ball and DFS player

our waiver wire section if you wait we're getting ahead of ourselves Alex oh I'm sorry fans feedback and we're gonna try to do this  from questions on the live stream oh my God technology how much I can handle this we've got one from Brooks Durham saying with hero down would you add keonte George or Kyle Lowry to fill in looking at our show notes yeah um wow this is a really interesting question so I think I would prefer  well it depends  man um and come on you ideally you could add them both the problem is that after hero comes back in two weeks I think Lowry kind of goes back to just not being that good now Lowry he was providing decent value before but nothing you can't replace off the wire I might lean keyonte George just for the long term upside  that's my that's gonna be my final answer all right well we'll discuss this more in the way I'll answer this question I'm going George I'm going upside here he has more he has more potential for long-term value just higher overall ceiling for the remainder of the Season Kyle Lowry's coming off a fantastic game he had 17 points 11 rebounds 9 assists but this goes back to last season with Lowery whether you watch the Heat if you watch the Heat in the playoffs you watched during the regular season last year Lowry every five six games will have kind of that vintage outing but and those other three four five games where he's off you'll see you see the age yeah you absolutely see what vintage three old so my my answer is you know if you're just looking for Value the next week or two while he the next couple weeks while Heroes out Lowry might provide more value than George but if you want long-term rest the season value take up Kiante all right we have another question in the chat so it's about  drops we have a few suggested trops at the end of our waiver wire section Mr Derwin Daly so we'll get to that later but now yes let's get to the waiver wire section yes for those of you who don't follow the show every week what we do here is we each provide two regular what we call regular waiver wire pickups which are players rostered in less than 50% of leaks typically we use Yahoo leagues and then we each do one long shot which is a roster and fewer than 25% of Yahoo leagues I'm gonna start things off with Kyle Lowry who we just talked about 30% roster in Yahoo League's we have Tyler hero out for two weeks Miami is three games next week's you're getting you're still getting some value there in that game that that hero got hurt Lottery goes for 17 points at 11 shots 11 rebounds 9 assists and one steal and 35 minutes like Sharingan to Luca to at Louise age what we've seen from him he has like a 11% usage this season you're hoping for like one out of every three or four games being like very good but we know we can hit  a bunch of Threes he's still a steals upside obviously assist upside even like he's ranked 80 second right now in eight cat so even with this kind of muted numbers is muted role he's been fine and again three games next week for the Heat a Ken who is your first waiver wire suggestion and I think he's the cover guy for our video we're going to New Orleans for Jordan Hawkins who's 45% rostered unfortunately pails only have three sets of four games next week  um the main reason is well there's two reasons CJ McCollum is out with a lung issue this is the second time McCollum has been dealing with that I think he was out was it six weeks last time Alex you were on top of that when the  and there's no time table from a columns returned this season so the instantly started the rookie Hawkins and Monday night he had 31 points seven threes seven rebounds three assists and one steal over a team high 30 minutes talk about just getting tossed in the deep end I don't think he's gonna have a 31 points every night but goodness gracious Jordan Hawkins looks like the real deal for the Pelicans  they're very interesting pickup in New Orleans I think you know Dice and Daniels can get a look as well I Dyson Daniels more of a natural point guard Hawkins is more of a two guard off the ball guard so I've liked Daniels to possibly step up if CJ's out for ends up being out for that long but Hawkins will have a pretty significant role either way Sharon wants you take us to your first waiver wire suggestion this guy we talked about preseason during drafts even probably in one of the first waiver wire pickups of this year but he's still wildly under-owned Kobe white for the Chicago Bulls has been solid this year his overall ranked this season is in the 160 range but he's remains locked into the starting lineup for Chicago and he's picked up his he's picked up his performance recently just looking at the past five games yeah yeah past five games 13.6 points 3.2 rebounds four point eight of assist 1.2 Steals and 1.83 pointers as well South percentage is a from the line 83.3 percent 43 and a half for Kobe white I'll take it I think that's solid enough from from from the floor but you've got some three-pointers with the assist  creeping up I like him more and I think he should be considered in most 12 teams especially if you need that 3-pointer assist combo yeah he had three dud games in a row but the last four is really turned it on kind of a new role for him right he's not really a pure point guard but that's what they need him to be and I think he'll get better with more time playing with the starters and 33 minutes per game over the last five that's very significant they have I don't know if you mentioned it they have four games next week so there's a chance you pick them up he keeps the hot streak rolling and then you just hang on to him so I think it's a that's a really good suggestion my second waiver wire suggestion is the clinic Kelly Olynyk 32% roster and Yahoo League's Walker Kessler out at least two weeks we touched on that at the top of the show and their first game without Kessler what they did Will Hardy shifted John Collins up to Center and then put in Ochi abaji in the Stargate lineup and also switched Taylor Horton Tucker for keyonte George so a lot happened in the previous game that was against Indiana all the Nick played only 21 minutes  but he was in foul trouble so I think it's worth monitoring what he does in tonight's game just Friday to see kind of where his minutes are  he ranks olinik in only 20 minutes per game right now for the whole season ranks 128 so he's usable in 12 teams as it is he sees a 9% usage increase with Kessler off the floor we know he's a per 36 monster we saw that happen at points last year we saw it happen when he got traded to Houston a couple years back and he just kind of took the team over and you talked three games next week so you're you don't have to worry about a short week he will not get you blocked so if you are going to stream Olin hopefully you can do it at Ford not Center and still have somebody get you blocks for you but we love the clinic I feel like he's a streaming option every year for us I'm changing my format I went with just one regular pick and going to long shots and my first long shot back to the Miami Heat I'm going he would Heisman who's only 3% rostered in Yahoo he are the last three games for the Heat and averaging 23 minutes a game as you if we met as we mentioned earlier in the show Tyler hero is out Wednesday versus Memphis he had Highsmith had 14 points four stocks and two threes and look the heat are just thin after this offseason where they lost Max screws to Cleveland Gabe Vincent went to the Lakers I think heisman's another one of those uncovered gems that the Miami Heat seemed to find every year  anyway only three games for the heat but I like Highsmith in a deep League flyer or if you've got a big bench  yeah they're they're they put them in the starting lineup he's in the rotation over Catholic Kevin Love right now um and we've we've seen in years past that they they clearly like him I don't know if they know what he is I don't know but they're they wanted to happen whatever it is so I think that's a good deeply suggesting Tyler hero means more usage  uh Shannon you've got a pretty sexy second pickup suggestions these sassy Marcus Sasser rookie backup point guard for the Detroit Pistons has been on and on a heater for the past week or so over the past five games 27.4 minutes off the bench 16.4 points 3.4 rebounds 3.4 or 3.8 assists 1.6 steals shooting 55.9% from the floor 2.63 pointers anyone who watched the Bucks Pistons game the other night saw Marcus Sasser take over pretty much in the third quarter 266 and 2 with one steel 11 for 17 from the floor three three-pointers in that game you know there's been a lot of a lot of hype for Monty Williams about Sasser it's been obvious you know even going back to Summer League preseason that he likes Sasser quite a bit and you know right now you look  at the last three games  Jade and Ivy has set out I was how was this happening with Jayden ivy around  I know I know and then he got out as well so the team has been short-handed so that's part of yup absolutely Mighty Morris also out that is all part of it but yeah every single comment I see for Monty Williams about Sasser is encouraging I believe Sasser is one of his guys I think he really likes them he likes the fit for this team you know I think there's even a possibility that Sasser gets moved into the starting lineup before a guy like Ivy does you know in place of Killian Hayes for instance I think that's a possibility in the next month or two it might not happen immediately but it is a possibility but for now just if he continues to be this productive Off the Bench it's he's never been 30 over 30 fantasy points per game over the past five games and he's wildly under her own right around 30% rostered on Yahoo right now you're looking for point guard production a score you know it's never going to be a I don't think they'll be a six assists guy or anything like that even if he gets a starting role but three-pointers scoring  solid percentages  that's all on the table with Marcus Sasser maybe those Pistons should have drafted Keegan Murray well can't do it can't do anything about it now but no I mean this is so this is who Sasser projected to be when you draft him 25th he was a spark plug scorer great with the ball on his hands and also I think a little bit of underrated Defender you look at him he's six one one nineties you don't project them to be a good Defender but he has a good hands good instincts he's got at least one steal I think this is in the past what six games so I think this is pretty real for sasseur at least until we get some clarification on injuries  my long shot waiver wire pickup  which I can't believe he qualifies as a long shot Reggie Jackson of the Denver Nuggets who of course is going to see increased playing time with Jamal Murray out for probably about a month and I think it's notable that  it's a hamstring for Jamal Murray notoriously tough to come back from notoriously High re-injury rate for hamstrings play 32 minutes Jackson did and Wednesdays close when over the Warrior's that's notable since he played 24 and 25 minutes in the previous two games so I think some people looked at that and went oh you know I have to pick him up both of those games were blowouts this Warriors game was closed and he played 32 minutes he's averaging uh 15.6 assists and one and a half steals per 36 on the season don't expect the steals to keep up okay he's not that guy but you will happily in a deeply take something like 14 and 5 or 13 and four consistently for a month and if you're concerned about just what they have next week they have three games but this is a long term pickup for pretty much every week  yeah if you if you were in a league where Reggie Jackson was rostered last season for the first couple months of the year when he was starting for the Clippers  then he'll provide similar value this year there's not going to be anything too I popping or anything that really gush about write home about if you will but he'll have value the minutes will be there  so it's an oddly shoot first plinker I always wanted more assist from Jackson even going back to his piston days never seems that  well someone who is not shoot first nor pass first is your third waiver wire option can I've got what I'm going with a second long shot we mentioned earlier in the show Jonathan Isaac the magic have four games next week and in 16 minutes last night 12 points 7 boards two blocks and one three could he finally be healthy probably not can he stay healthy for games hopefully if you're desperate and you know could you some crazy big guy stats hack it's always fun to take a take a flyer on Jonathan Isaac cross your fingers and hope he doesn't visit the mass unit anytime soon one week maybe maybe  what do you guys think  I think this is the right let's put this way this is the right time to pick him up because they're down there starting center Isaac can play some some small ball Center and they have they have four games this week this is the time to pick him up maybe it doesn't work but if you if you're interested in do it just do it now yeah it's it's yeah I think we hinted at this at the top too is if it's deeper leagues 14 teams it makes sense if you're if you're playing at 10 Team league illegal that's only 120 players deep you know he's not gonna he's not gonna factor in there yet yeah he can't he has no business on a 10 team and in general most of the long shot success suggestions are that you know they're they they can crack the top 150 but top 120 top 100 is very unlikely that brings me to my guy who I actually think has top 100 upside even though he's a long shot  keyonte George rookie guard for the Utah Jazz  he is a roster 13% on the Yahoo he is three games next week you know Alex mentioned George was  plugged into the starting lineup for Utah with Kessler down it's kind of been in the cars there's been a the roster percentage for George is only above 10% because there's been a lot of folks stashing him since draft season and it's because it's expected he'll eventually take over the starting point guard role Horton Tucker hasn't been great to start the season Jordan Clarkson's not a point guard counts Sexton's not really a point guard either Chianti George is a first round pick and this is a rebuilding Jazz team no matter how well they surprisingly did last year they're in full rebuild right now and George is a guy they're gonna want to give a look to and his first start of the Season 31 minutes seven points to rebounds 9 assists three for eight from the floor you know it's those assists that's what you're chasing after with with George Here If he if he sticks in the starting lineup you know good chance he does even after Kessler returns there's no reason for them to plug George into the lineup like that unless the intention was to keep him there moving forward when you touched on this the Jazz were winning last year would not have been a time to develop somebody they didn't have a George office he's a rookie  but now they're losing like they're supposed to so hey use those minutes to develop the only true point guard you have on the roster  yeah and George George is interesting because in college he wasn't really in a CIS guy but I'm really average five assists and now he's averaging he's going to the NBA so  either you're old he's their potential point guard in the future it's not Taylor Horton Tucker It's not Collins Texas so that's that's kind of your argument here um okay Kent before we jump into our Friday DFS section we want to touch on some potential drops in fantasy leaks that people are wondering about well here's maybe the controversial one would you drop Jabari Smith if you're in a 10 Team league they've only got two games this coming week he's averaging 14 and 7 but less than half a block a game not shooting well  I just doesn't seem to be meshing with all those veterans they brought in their  I so  I think he's okay to drop in a team lead because his volume has not increased at all is shooting volume his defensive stats are not increasing neither is this he's exactly we was last year even if he can use to shoot a fishy I mean he's shooting 50% from the field and 40% from three and you're still only getting 14 points for game out of him  I think he's a drop he all right I I've been appreciate against that Jabari Smith Juniors currently ranked 9 category about 109 he's right in that one one ten range will call it through seven games guess who else is ranked rain that same range through seven games Jamal Murray Bruce Brown I'm not dropping those guys Chris Paul I'm not dropping Chris Paul Ken quick you might know an absolutely not Bruce Brown not a ten team or not 120 player deep 140 that's about 120 140 players deep in a lot of 10 teams I think Jabari Smith a hold I think it's super encouraging that we're seeing him hit 2.13 pointers per game the 50% from the floor is encouraging we're going to see better days ahead this year for Jabari Smith well here's some easier drops bones Hyland a norm Powell for the Clippers they have two games this week and obviously they just added James Harden and we are already top in the lack of minutes he's getting with the Pacers who only have 12 two games this week too okay before that's the end of our waiver wire segment Alex tell us about our good friends at Vivid Seats the NBA

and tear them properly after the show but please join us for the fun competition for tonight's nine games late  like Shannon mentioned they're not games late today we have a over under north of 240 which is always a good sign something people generally Target  Charlotte at Washington the rematch the Washington got the win the other night in their Road to Jordan Poole played like 18 minutes salon right hack his best game of his career Off the Bench it was just a complete nightmare if you play Fantasy let's put that way I I believe that this game will certainly be near that too forty because neither of these teams are interested in playing defense is there any buggy specifically from this game she and that you are looking to roster oh there is it's fantastic game honestly there's a lot of really good values on their Kyle kuzma whether it's on DraftKings or FanDuel I think he's Akron 8000 Andrea Kings 7800 on FanDuel he's good value as that number he's he's basically been a walk in 40 fantasy points the last couple weeks and I expect you know even when he's only playing 28 29 30 minutes per game he still pouring in close to 40 fantasy points tonight so I like him PJ Washington is a good value as well on the other side for Charlotte  the most interesting one for me if looking at the the expensive players lamelo is only 9100 on FanDuel he has been he's coming off back the last two games 64.5 fantasy points and 40 sticks point three fans against Washington yeah there was a little bit of early season rust with little mellow there were there was a potential minutes cap that seems to be out the window now back to back games where he's where he scored over 30 points 9100 super cheap for a player who can get you that 60 Fantasy Point marker yeah I plenty of people are gonna be talking to this game I love that lamelo ball salary anytime you can get lamelo ball and a game that might go to 240 I would certainly take that especially with Terry Rozier out you know they need someone else to handle the ball so Gordon hayward's interesting to me there as well Ken I know you're working hard to answer people's comments in the but I want to get your take on Brooklyn Boston we saw Boston come off a heartbreaking loss it's a 76ers the other night what have you seen for Boston lately is there anything specific you kind of match up they're gonna exalt you know they're safe now lost two in a row and so we're gonna continue to see huge minutes for the starters  because Coach Joe is not trusting anybody on this bench Alvin Sam Howser houses actually come out of his shooting slump but Payton Pritchard still shooting portly they don't seem to trust O'Shea Bassett anyway so just going to be big minutes  for all five starters including Derek white who is back from paternity leave  so and then you know they don't have a legit Center so we could see Persia score a lot over the top tonight with Nick Blackson out for the Nets yeah I'll be surprised like other other teams try to go small sometimes against Brooklyn because Brooklyn go small but when you have porzingis out there he can shoot threes yeah and he's good enough on the perimeter and again you run the pick and roll with them he's taller than everybody else so I think this could be a nice porzingis game we also have to Troy on tonight's late Shannon going up against the Philadelphia 76ers Detroit's at home during versus indeed um yes I'm going crazy about it even I he I'm not I I'm not gonna even go there man no I don't what I mean just tell us what you've seen from from Detroit lately  well it's been great you know Kate's been very solid he dominates the ball when he's in the game he's gonna have an opportunity put up a big fantasy night every single game even if he's leading the league in turnovers and taking some very ill-advised shots he's gonna have the ball in his hands he's gonna be making decisions for this team you know they're just young and experienced team Thompson during great great production they're getting rebounds they're getting blocks are getting those defensive stats to put up solid fantasy nights  against Philly though you know this the Pistons will be short-handed again tonight so there is some upside I worry about this game being closed you know even against Milwaukee the Pistons were able to keep it close because the honest got ejected honestly I think it was like a 13-point cushion at the time when the honest got ejected if you want to stay in he was having a hell of a game as well Pistons couldn't do anything when you honest and Lopez were both on the floor and diverting diverting shots blocking half of them that game would have been a blowout I expect a blowout tonight the six again a man handle my Pistons so I'm not very high on targeting any of the Pistons for tonight's DFS late I do think Maxie is the solid play on the other side and you could even have you know Revenge games aren't really a thing but Tobias Harris coming back Detroit place he's familiar with played there a few years he's also been better than I think people realized by his hair saving 19.3 points 6.4 rebounds 34 fancy points per game on  FanDuel scoring you know this guy who's going to be he's gonna have to do that for the Sixers all season now with hard not to town by his Harris is locked in as their number three scoring option for the remainder of the Season anyone who invested on Tobias Harris during draft days probably gonna get a solid value all seasons this this Pelicans Houston game we won't really touch on it because herb Jones questionable Zion Williamson question about upper and shangoo in questionable as you want to say something I do I do I mean we talked about a couple of guys you know we mentioned Hawkins during during our Fab pickups we mentioned Dyson Daniels briefly these are some of the better values for tonight Hawkins on FanDuel despite having that big game that Ken mentioned is still 4700 so I think he's a very good option  you know even Dyson Daniels a little bit risky here because we don't know what his role is going to be if he's going to start again tonight he's at 50 100 I like Hawkins more at 47 and then  you know the the rocket side I'm not as high because I think they're they're core and their rotation still kind of yelling trying to figure out who's going to play 30 plus minutes every night and trying to forecast which players step up you know somebody stealing green Jabari Smith has had one or two gig games Fred Van Fleet solid game Dillon Brooks you know it kind of it's always up in the air and they juggle responsibilities with that team and who's gonna have a big night so I'm staying away from the rocket rockets for most part but there's some value on the New Orleans side we we covered about half the Slate I'm just going to touch on the rest of the games very quickly wolves Spurs we have one Benn Jama going up against the Minnesota Timberwolves that's gonna be another tough matchup for him after he kind of flounder at MSG you taught versus Memphis this could be a great Utah spot who has to be a great Memphis spot this over under is up at 2:30 keep an eye on Kelly Olynyk we have Battle of the high usage guards Clippers versus Mavericks I will be a fun game La vs Fenix Beale is presumably going to play in this game again Booker still out Anthony Davis questionable and then okay see Sacramento a pretty straight up game right now except for the fact that deer and Fox is still out do you have like one  you know like thought from like one closing thought someone you want to play or somebody you want to avoid for tonight's slay Chan  I'm gonna give you like two or three closing thoughts deal with it the Utah map this game I think it's very intriguing as well we mentioned players from Utah keyonte George 4300 on FanDuel I like George depending on what the Jazz does with their starting lineup John Collins 6100 could be interesting or if Olynyk abide if obachi gets gets moved back to the bench and a Linux starts against Memphis a Linux can be a very good fantasy play on the other side for Memphis bismack biyombo is the starting center for for Memphis right now correct I know he started yes started twice you know twice yeah well we'll see what happens with Tillman I know Tillman was a late scratch for one of those games that bismack started so he's 5200 he could he could provide some value and then one final takeaway going back to the game we know Ken's gonna watch Brooklyn Boston no Camp Thomas  right that means we're going to be able to see last year's version of Michelle Bridges the guy who everyone was drafted in the second round this year we could see him tonight against Boston he's under 8,000 77 7700 has used to be up he's gonna have more shots he doesn't have the number one gonna running next to him so give me Mikhail Bridges tonight my DFS lineups and then you can't you gotta assume cam Johnson in his first game back probably be low usage I I would be surprised if he plays more than 20 minutes  excellent DFS advice gentleman Alex please tell us about our friends at rival fantasy Lebron vs Jordan magic vs bird

Chicago's red on red floor looks like either a crime scene or a cheeseless lasagna the Boston floor has no Park a that is sacrilegious the next floor is bright orange with a dizzying layered New York word logo at Center Court and too old for this I need to watch with sunglasses on stop the insanity  do you think the Chicago courts like a take on Chicago style pizza  baby put the red idiots well yeah it's worth a Detroit style pizza where the sauce goes on top yeah thank you put the sauce on top for the Chicago style as well at Deer down as does but why red on red it's more of a casserole
