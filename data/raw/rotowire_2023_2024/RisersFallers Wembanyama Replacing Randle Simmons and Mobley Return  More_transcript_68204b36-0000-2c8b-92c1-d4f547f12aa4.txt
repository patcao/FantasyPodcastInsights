hey everybody I'm Dr a Steve Alexander it's Tuesday  January 30th  welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy Hoops podcast brought to you by Underdog and FanDuel this is Jonas I used to work with him and NBC we have a lot to cover after a really busy 2014 Monday night did somebody say Ben Simmons Michael  Jonas tried to jump the gun there my man well you know it's a very complicated very  intense process and you know I do all the production myself here and not you know I  sometimes it's I just make things more complicated than it needs to be I know how it has been how many positive we've done together what two three hundred  roughly  yeah  more than Ben Simmons games played essentially right yeah more than more  we've done more pods than Ben Simmons has made Fritos  and we will do more pods today than Ben Simmons will make a three-pointer this season that's right  Jonas Ben Simmons played basketball last night he made five of five shots he had 10 points eight rebounds 11 assists a steal and a block he played 18 minutes it was a Brooklyn Rob I mean they  destroyed Utah one 47 to 14  I'm getting text messages from famous rock stars at like two in the morning like did you see what Ben Simmons did and I'm seeing headlines on big huge websites like Ben Simmons looks amazing  did this  then Simmons thing moved the needle for you at all on him honestly a little bit he think about it zero turnovers he pushed the pace looked explosive and I mean if you look at the Nets the last two months like they're probably the least Happy fan base I know you have an argument for Atlanta you got Charlotte but like the fan base is irritated they need something to get excited about and I feel like this front office is gonna lean on Ben Simmons to be that excitement Factor because like we can't continue to see Dinwiddie shoot 20 shots a game and make three of them you know I mean the the Nets need something they don't even have their own first round pick this year they got a you know leave their hopes on something and it's going to be Ben Simmons the question is is how many games has he actually gonna play  you know that we're halfway through the season the over under is probably gonna be set around 20  honestly for him so total wild card to see what happens but if you have them even stash him I know you're excited right now  well to quote myself at two o'clock in the morning replying to Brian from Guster I could not care less know I mean it is interesting but you know we heard all the same garbage about Ben Simmons in the preseason oh he looks great he's pushing he's pushing the pace he's running the floor he's getting rebounds he's getting assist still can't hit three pointers he still can't make free throw shooting is not gonna be five for five every night he's still a lot of other miles to feed in Brooklyn you know I I need to see a few more times before I'm going to get excited and even even if things do go well from here on in  I mean he's still gonna hurt you in those other categories and I'm just I'm  I'm done Jonas I'm just done I'm out  I mean you're excitement level is a lot more than it was two days ago right it's a step in the right direction  I mean it's the first time we said Ben Simmons name in a long time so right all right so yeah here's what I'm taking away from this I am not running the way of wire or walking there to get Ben Simmons you on the other hand would put him on a roster in the right situation is that correct absolutely and I still have them too I haven't been one nine cat league and have a 1.6 and that's the one where I'm most excited about because like a Steals and blocks numbers haven't been there this year but like in previous years he was the kind of guy that can get you probably about two combined Steals and blocks in like 30 minutes so like I said Mike Simon's a lot more than it was two days ago but I still have my hesitations about how many games so actually play yeah I can get behind him in a in a points League a lot more than I can  in any other type of links so I can at least get with you on that meanwhile your man Spencer Dinwiddie who has been hit or miss all season he's kind of been kind of a mini disaster I think  over five two points eight assists Dennis Smith Jr 12.5 assists Lonnie Walker 19 Off the Bench cam Thomas is back to being good cam again I'm sure that means bad cam is just around the corner he had 25  seven rebounds four triples um so  normally when Spencer Dinwiddie seems to be going away Dennis Smith Jr is kind of like coming on but now with Ben Simmons in the middle of all this  they're all a little bit messier than they were before yeah but if you rewind to the beginning of the season when Ben was actually playing they were really hyping up the combo between Ben Simmons and cam Tomas like they were really talking up those two playing together  so in terms of his excitement going forward I would have  Cam Thomas number one Ben Simmons number two I think Lonnie Walker number three and I think didn't witty number four like I still think there's going to be plenty minutes for Lonnie Walker you have to factor this too the trade deadlines and what lesson two weeks Royston Hills gone right Dorian Finney Smith probably gone there's going to be a ton of minutes and Brooklyn and then that's going to open up for Dennis bass Junior as well who's had some really good moments to see and you just had trouble staying healthy so there's a lot to like about Brooklyn at this trade deadline for fancy coming up all right  Jonathan Isaac last night started for the Orlando Magic  people loaded up on him in FanDuel and other DraftKings and whatnot  two points nothing else eight minutes  unknown injury Jonas according to RotoWire newsfeed  pretty sad it was his first start and what like four and a half years or something right um  so I I think people were getting excited about and John Isaac for me falls in the same  into the same bin as Ben Simmons Wake Me Up When right you know when something good happens for an extended period of time I do feel badly he got hurt I do feel bad it didn't work out so Anthony black kind of caught fire but that team has four point guards so yeah I don't know that you can really get excited about anyone but any thoughts on any anything to do with the magic last night you know I guess wish they would have said up front that Isaac was going to play eight minutes I think the undisclosed unknown injury is BS if I'm being honest I feel like this was a plan from the get-go hey we're gonna let you play in the back-to-back but it's not gonna be one step and you're working to call it done right the NBA's injury reporting has made it so you can just make up an injury on the whim and there's just no accountability you know I mean we've seen it with indeed we seen it with Portland there's just no accountability sometimes they'll throw a fine here and there but it's a joke you know you can just say knee soreness or injury management and then pull a player  so I just wish they would have been up front with what they were going to do but  at some point I do feel like Isaac is going to be Unleashed  but I still think we're at least a month away from that happening  I feel like we're more like a couple years eight months 10 months next year next season right  a little late side note I saw on Twitter last night Jalen Williams got hurt at the end of the OKC game spring is right ankle could not put weight on it that sounds terrible yeah um  to me that means he's going to miss a week or two if I'm guessing right we don't have that time table yet he could be fine you know it could be situation where it really doesn't swell very very much overnight but either way are you a lewd dork guy or an Isaiah Joe guy I'm going to be a bit of a wildcard here and say neither and go with case and Wallace not the most exciting player but because it low usage obviously but over the last two weeks he's a tenth round value and 19 minutes for game 7 points three rebounds 1.3 assists 1.3 steals 0.4 blocks and 1.4 triples that's a 19 minutes that's on 61% shooting from the field  like his shooting this entire season has been unreal and he's just one of those guys were like two three years you're just asking yourself how the heck did the Thunder get this guy you know what I mean like they're just going to be so ridiculously loaded in two three years when these guys mature and it's just scary like we're talking multiple finals runs for OKC in my opinion the next couple years  that's a solid take I I'm gonna go with Isaiah Joe but I think I like Cason Wallace may be more than ludo's sort of a three-point machine when he gets opportunities and  hopefully Jones not hurt me and I love Jalen I know he's Jonas I got a new microphone I just broke it out today for the first time ever and check this out  Underdog fantasy is the number one platform for NBA best fall

think the same microphone is me you got the yeti right  I got something I don't know  I think it is the yeti I founded in a box nice that's cool we got from Rotoworld that was our gift  back you know what um you know what else I found I I had a dude coming over  to my office yesterday to help me set up some stuff I got a new chair  I might be I might be doing my own  podcast on Wednesdays from this very spot I don't know but it was helping me and I found two  Taylor Swift calendars okay under a blanket and a pile of crap on a bed that is to my right and my office and I bought those like in October from my daughter's Christmas gifts so I know I presented those a month late to my daughter's as their Christmas gift yesterday you know to help celebrate we just can't have enough Travis Kelce in our lives Jonas  so  okay moving on to Dallas  Jonas what is Grant Williams suck  dude he's so bad like when you told me about that stat line like I knew he had a good game the other day but I didn't not know it was that good but then I looked over the month right so in the month of January check this out this is after he had that 27 point game he said six point nine points 2.8 rebounds 2.1 assist  1.3 triple the dude is terrible at Fantasy Basketball absolutely terrible but he wasn't in Boston  I mean he wasn't great either but yeah I agree he's gone way downhill  you know I love you know the good 27 points eight rebounds three steals a block and seven three-pointers on Saturday against the Kings and then everybody fires him up last night and he has three points in two boards in 29 minutes so bad so so bad  meanwhile Tim Hardaway Jr scored 36 Derek Lively had 20 and 11 Steele and block  Luca  Luca 459 15 and 2  Jonas you've had some time to think about this for five years who do you think won the Luca for trade trade  can you just rewind about four or five years ago though people were actually asking this question and they're like you know I feel like both teams won this trade and it just sounds so idiotic now like Trey Young's just like a traffic cone on defense he's not playing winning basketball he's complaining he's been whining about his head coaches for the past four years apparently he likes Quin Snyder though so good for him but man  if anyone still says that's a win-win trade don't take them serious you know I was at the game on Friday when I know when Lucas scored 73 and I've  I've never seen anything like it yeah it was awesome and my son got to hang out Dominique so that was cool Jaden Hardy last night hit 8 of 9 and 4 triples 20.7 boards stealing a block can't really trust him on any given night unless Luca is not playing I think January's fine to throw in there and Jaden Hardy  is worth keeping an eye on because he's a good player yeah and if Dante XM goes down or if Tim Hardaway Jr goes down or Derek Jones Junior goes down I mean hard he's gonna be in the mix so um I've got him on my 30 deep team I like having him there he's on my bench unfortunately but  he's a guy worth keeping an eye on to  but funny story about Jayden Hari doc that's your average about every week or so they do these one bees at practices and apparently Hardy just Cooks everybody during those so little fun size for their like like he said he is a true baller the issue is we don't know why he's going to come back like we always hear day-to-day and then it ends up being four or five games and then 10 games you know what I mean so whenever Irving's out you could pick up party but if Irving and Luke are out man this is a guy that could pop off for 30 and give a night so  you're absolutely right  um  Julius Randle separated shoulder from the Nicks  I I said that I thought Josh Hart was going to be the guy he had eight points 12 boards seven assists in 39 minutes last night Donte divincenzo  at 28.6 boards five assists five triples 42 minutes  precious started had nine and five and thirty three minutes Isaiah hartenstein is back had 10 points for boards and 16 minutes  what is your take on the fill-ins besides the obvious Jalen brunson's gonna go nuts yeah I mean the issue here is that most of the guys you mentioned are already you know gone right Dante Davidson was a hot pick up several several weeks ago Josh Hart should have already been picked up even though he can't shoot the ball this season precious is just okay you know you're not gonna be excited about having him on your team but he's just to warm body getting a ton of minutes I think the player that everybody should be watching as quick and grinds you know decent limit sometimes the season sometimes he complete disappears for weeks so Grimes 32 minutes yesterday took 11 shots didn't play that great but hey those minutes are there I think Grimes is kind of that that borderline out you're looking at over the next couple weeks because we don't really have a concrete time table on Reno could be anywhere from two weeks to what six weeks and it's just not really clear not really clear yet so you know they haven't really come out and said but I picked up Josh Hart the day after Randall went now yeah I was close to dropping even shenzo about 12 different times right season so like  so he may be available out there I'm not messing with a Chua  right heart and I think once he gets back to full strength is fine to get back in your lineup he just is gonna take him a minute to get back he's been out a while  and but yeah I like the minutes that even shenzo and and Josh Hart got and right you know Thibodaux won't be afraid to run those guys in the ground  all right what's that they got to talk about Charlotte there's a lot going on there well let's talk about Charlotte Brandon Miller went on a Fourth Street Run game Run of 20 points or more and then he had like five and 12 and back to back games and really cool off and then last time he went off again with 29 Points and seven boards I feel like Charlotte is going to fold up the 10th this you know the second half of the season and they're just gonna let Miller go out there and do whatever he wants I think I think Brandon Miller is going to blow up in the second half  here's the thing so I think Miles Bridges is gone I think the Phoenix rumors are very very real I agree I think PJ Washington he's gone and I feel like Nick Nick Richards has gone as well so that's three players that are getting heavy minutes right now on top of all the injuries  who's left you know what I mean it's gonna be a Miller Miller's gonna get a ton of minutes  the the bad news about him is like the defense it's been good in flashes but the defense of numbers are not that great you know last seven games he's a what is a 0.6 deals 0.4 blocks like that's not good enough but other than that 20.4 points 2.63 pointers five rebounds almost three assists everything else is fine it's just like he's a what would you call him a Harrison Barnes 2.0 right now  because the defensive stats just haven't been good enough but it depends on if you're talking about the Harrison Barnes from two weeks ago or the current I know there's some birds know that was it off  yeah Nick Richards I think is interesting him and him and pjw both went off on what Saturday and then they both kind of stunk last night but whatever you think of mellow is going to get traded  no no absolutely not can you match so I'm from Charlotte you know I live like 45 minutes from the arena he is the only player I would say him and Miller the only players at Charlotte Hornet a fans care about if they traded ball who we trading him for first of all you know what I mean like there's just no scenario in which he's gone obviously you're concerned about the ankles but it's with this draft coming up it's not that exciting I can't imagine any scenario which lamelo's traded I just can't is there anybody else on Charlotte that you would like  you cut out the very last second anyone else in Charlotte what  oh hold on your internet freezes on and  you're back you're back we're back is there anybody else in Charlotte you want to talk about  no he's in Charlotte you want to talk about because there's no one else on the team that's good you know what I mean there's if they traded if they traded three those guys I just mentioned who are you picking up there's nobody you know I mean obviously you have players coming back and trades but right now there's nobody so did you buy on these Sam Merrill bait a week ago  I didn't I wish I did at the time and then now I don't feel so bad that I don't have them if that makes sense because like you said he has cooled off a bit he scored in double figures in five straight games then he had seven points and 17 minutes like on Saturday and then zero points in seven minutes last night they pulled the plug on him I didn't read about it injury I think it you know everybody's getting healthy in Cleveland and maybe maybe the parties over or was it ever a party to begin with first name on the season on the season he's 40% from Deep that's insane like the kid can play but at the minutes aren't there what are you doing because there's nothing else in this stat sheet that really pops out decent playmaker not the worst rebounder in the world for a guard but yeah  I think the show is over for now  yeah it's kind of sad I dropped him  I dropped him to activate Tyreese Halliburton off the  injured list last night got Jonas why can't Zion Williamson ever do anything right  I don't know where to begin man leave it waiting for Zion to put together consistency is Rookie year and he just hasn't I just don't know if it's ever going to happen for him in what's your take on  he's played 11 games in January  the most rebounds he's had in one of those games is six  he's the biggest guy out there he's a power forward  you know he is scoring is fine right is scoring right now is fine his health is fine it seems like everything is coming together everything's coming up roses  but then he gets three rebounds a game  he's blocked two shots and his last eight games he's at one three-pointer in January  he's not really a very good free throw shooter it's just it's just points and a bunch of  bunch of stuff that doesn't really matter this is what I don't get so I'm a Duke fan always have been and I remember watching him at Duke and there was one game where I think Duke was losing by like 15 or 20 points against Louisville right and so they put Zion at Center and then leave us a score for like six or seven minutes because Zion is just blocking and stealing everything it's just like where is that guy you know what I mean we just haven't seen it like ever since he entered the NBA steal rate plummeted block rate plummeted he's obviously not in great shape like it's just a shame like the player we saw it Duke would be terrorizing the NBA right now and he's just just not the same guy I just don't get it yeah I'm not I'm I'm out on Zion unless he really like changes his entire lifestyle and he comes back when one after an off-season he looks like a totally different player and he's right the motors back and his you know he's talking the right game like I I just I can't do it man it's  if it's not happening in New Orleans just get them out of there you know maybe the grass is greener elsewhere his name is so much bigger than his game

nice nap  I kind of checked out I kind of checked out last night  didn't really stay up and watch Scandal late games although the room really any too late games where they're um but I learned at 4 a.m. that Grayson Allen have only played 13 minutes due to a sprained right ankle  I've got Grayson Allen about everywhere is there some sort of a group therapy meeting you know that I can go to  unfortunately know and it's funny because I feel like Grayson Allen is the is the guy that nobody was on coming into the air you know what I mean like no one expected this Grace now and  last I looked he was like near the leaders among three-point percentage and it's like heavy heavy volume as well and then you start seeing all these trade rumors about Grace and I'm like why  he's Phoenix's best role player why is he in trade rumors so that was odd to me but like I said I hope he doesn't miss any time because dude is an absolute baller right now and I think he died in the NBA shooting 50 490 ten days ago that is fine so in and then it's interesting too because he's 28 he's kind of like yeah that reputation of being kind of dirty and nobody really likes Grayson Allen well I haven't seen him do anything shady for a while and  you know it's like oh Bradley Beal's coming back bye bye Grace and Allen know he's not going away  so it's it's pretty bizarre also Grayson Allen goes down last night and guess who went nuts Eric Gordon 23 points five triples four rebounds five assists two Steals and two blocks that's that's crazy Alan's Gonna Miss time it's it's Eric Gordon's seasoning again right apparently but he was missing in action for about a good month there you know how many games did Air Jordan have where he was putting up five or six points and then you know you hear all the rumors about him not being utilized enough we'll do get in line you've got Durant you've got Booker you've got feel like get in line  so  so yeah so we need to keep an eye on Grayson Allen's status how many how can since returning from his injury two games he's averaging 4 Points two boards two and a half and this one and a half steals 24.5 minutes uh did we lose our beloved Jaime jaquez or is he just on a break and he'll be back good as new here in a minute I think this is a great Bi-Lo  honestly because you got a factor in Jimmy Butler what there's how many games left 3542 who knows at this point but Jimmy Butler is going to miss one in three games most likely this just what he does right obviously Terry Rozier their throws a wrench into things  but man how may at one point he was like the leading scorer in the clutch you know at one point I think it was in December or something like that he was just playing almost every minute for Miami I still think this screens by low he's getting healthy again by low for me for sure  I like that take I mean he's such an integral part of what they do you know we've been saying it all year he really doesn't look like a rookie out there with the heat he's kind of a team leader or explosive loves him his teammates love him it's been a rough couple games and you know sometimes sometimes players get hurt and it takes some a long time to get back sometimes they get hurt and you never see him again that season I don't think we're there with Jaime it's just a slow start so right I agree with Jonas now it's probably a good time to look into trying to acquire how many Hawkins the Houston Rockets rocked the Lakers last night 135 to 119 I'll be shengwen  has become the monster we thought he was going to Jonas three years ago 31 12/7 to steals a block and then there's cam Whitmore 20.6 boards two triples  his last four games he scored 2019 24 and 12  he's actually had a pretty big month I mean there's some single digit scoring games in there but there's also a lot of double-digit scoring games I think what more is one of those guys it's available in a ton of League's and should be  near the top of people's lists to pick up off the waiver wire in my opinion right and the thing about Ken Whitmore too is if Jalen green hadn't found his form you know his recent form has been actually really good if jailing green hadn't found this formula last couple weeks imagine where Whitmore would be right now you know I mean he's had these little burst here and there with an inconsistent role but can you imagine if jailing had continued his downward trend you know up until now Whitmore would be playing a ton of minutes it would be putting like tops 25 numbers  but unfortunately Jillian green did he back up so I still think we're gonna see us sporadic role going forward and that's unfortunate because he is a baller what is going on with Jalen green like where did this come from like what what happened no idea like there was a couple of articles in the athletic about you know coach losing confidence and all this good stuff and then he comes up with a 10 rebound game you know energy has been a lot better in the defensive end so credit to him and he's really turned it on so excited about that Specialists of having so many dinosaurs  what's going on with the Lakers dude LeBron ad in the Angelo all scored 23 points last night which is hard to do it's hard to have your big three score twenty three but that's about all the went right there ruining Austin Reeves as we sit here and watch  what is going on  well I'll tell you this it's hard to have teen chemistry when you're team is linked to every single available star or role player in the NBA like let's say there's 500 players in NBA I think 400 of them have been photoshopped into a Lakers uniform and put into a trade room her and the last two weeks and she's like how do you have Team chemistry when half your teams on the Block you know what I mean it's just I don't get it you know speaking of half your half your team's been photoshopped into a different uniform I was talking to this bartender at a restaurant the other night local restaurant she's like yeah my brother is in college and he's become one of the top  graphic artists for NFL  and I'm like what do you mean she's like you up well when it's rumored that a players gonna get traded in our team he changes their uniforms and she pulled up this video on her phone like showed it to me and she has all these Instagram followers like he got hired by the Falcons he's just his college kid that puts jerseys on players like that's that's where we are kids today is world you can do anything you just gotta be you just gotta be the first one there  okay are you a pick up a Grizzly any Grizzly guy right now John okay you did this last year with a thunder right because the Thunder and thunder I love it  yeah I mean the Grizzlies are probably the hardest team to gauge right now right because like two three weeks ago you everyone's like they're throwing in the towel it's over and then they went on this win streak and now they're back in the you know the playoff picture is like what direction are they going to go and I feel like I usually have a pretty good read in these things I have no idea I have no idea I mean do they strapped in and go for the 8C just to get completely clobbered in the first round four zero  Maybe  or do they just throw in the towel and try and get a you know a relatively High pick and a mediocre draft those are the two options right now and if they choose to draft route I know you put this in the notes for a pod what happens to JJJ  do they completely shut them down I don't think so  but I don't think he plays them back to backs I think it's minutes go down to 27 28 for game just like they were a couple years ago and I start thinking we see some fake injuries as well like we've already seen some fake injuries and Memphis right I mean you can't have three players show up with left hand soreness with Dolphin tags you know on a random Monday night this stuff doesn't happen like that so that's the reason I'm thinking they're leaning more towards tearing it down and going for the draft that's where I'm leaning now but about yeah I'm still worried about Triple J and shut down your guy  um but yeah no Vince Williams last night which  crushed my soul no Luke Kennard again  Santi aldama played okay Xavier told him played okay Rowdy David Roddy played okay Scotty Pippen Jr played okay GG Jackson look good uh are you a Gigi Jackson guy  honestly I am  I feel like he still has that kind of mystery box upside I feel like he's someone that can take on a ton of usage it's gonna be a roller coaster at times I think there's gonna be some nights where it's gonna be just him at a bunch of 10-day contracts and he's gonna go five of 25 from the field one night and then the next night he'll go 11 to 17 and put up like 30 points you know me he's gonna be a total Wild Card the percentages are going to be rough turn over is going to be rough but in terms of just counting stats I would say GG Jackson is probably the one I'm most excited about going forward Among The Fringe players in Memphis  even more than Vince Williams  honestly wow  that's big I'm way more excited about Ben's than I am JiJi but I like Gigi I'm hopeful that Gigi lives up to the hype right but I'm not I'm all about mentally and I'm kind of also a little bit about Luke Kennard right now if you need healthy  but yeah he's had those knee issues though and The Grizzlies will milk that you know  back-to-back set coming up he's got left knee soreness sorry you're out yeah they will and I like Santi aldama over Xavier Tillman personally I do too I do too okay let's talk Harry Barnes for a second Harry Harry B um  in his previous like three or four games before this little explosion he went on he scored like  three two and six points or something like that and then something weird happened and he went off for 32 points season High last Monday and then Thursday I think you went off for 39 and then on the weekend he had a 20-point game and then last night he had 12  like what is happening why why are the Kings suddenly turning to Harry bars why is Harry Barnes suddenly  balling out do you have any idea I have a conspiracy theory  I feel like he seen his name in the rumor mill way too many times in the last two three weeks I think every article that Jake Fisher of Yahoo sports has put out has included Harry Barnes in there I think shamans mentioned him at one point and I think it's obvious he doesn't want to he doesn't he doesn't want to get out of Sacramento  you know I mean I feel like he's really stepped up his game as a result and his fancy managers are obviously loving it so that's my Conspiracy Theory what about you  yeah I mean that's that's the only thing I can figure or that or that Sacramento is showcasing him now like hey get the ball of Harry let's yes let's show the let's show the people that the old man can still get it done also love the fact that we call him Harry I know I don't know a lot of people that call Harrison Barnes Harry but I I enjoy it um I always have one of my favorite pastimes  since back in the old days have you paid attention to how  well let's go back to Harry for a second are you yeah would you pick up Harrison Barnes right now and stash them absolutely absolutely I would yeah yeah  same I've got him on team actually yeah um  have you paid attention to how Dreadful Josh giddey has been in January  honestly no  I hate every time I see him with the ball at the top of the key because I feel like the the Thunder offense just kind of stagnates  but I only have them in like one League out of like 20 dice I think I'm in not thrilled about it obviously with a lot of other things going on but I guess feel like he's slows down the Thunder offense too much I feel like if they make a big move in the next year or two I think he's the piece that moves  honestly about you well the last time I looked at rankings when I do my risers and fallers column for for ESPN and he was like the very last ranked player and the very bottom of the the algorithm ranking list I've been looking at and his January numbers are just so bad and then last night he had 13 points four rebounds two assists like there's nothing good about it women Yamaha like the announcers like women Yama stuffed  a giddy shot at him and they were like serious question dude is that a block or a steal and the other the color guy was like dude I don't know maybe it's both maybe it's a block and a steal because he just sort of took it out of his hand as he was shooting it and Josh  getting is a big dude he'd be a power forward on most teams  if giddy shows up on Waiver Wires in your league or you jumping on him immediately  oh God honestly I think I would just because the waiver wire you know leading up to deadlines is pretty bare  you know what I mean so I think right now I would but after the trade deadline with all these new pickups that are going to come I would say after the sorry after the deadline know now yes to be clear well people last week started asking about cutting Josh giddey and I was like oh you're crazy and then I looked at the numbers I was like yeah you're not crazy yeah cuz he's been bad but you really not gonna drop him if I've got him I'm just gonna try not to play him if I can help it he speaking of Victor women Yamaha  22 points 11 boards for assists  a steal three blocks  Devin vassell last night 24  5 5 boards for assists a block a three  have you been watching wimpy play basketball  all the time  all the time he's my he's probably the favorite player to watch right now it used to be JJJ I have a new love I'm sorry like he's just too much fun to watch and I've seen almost everyone you know that I follow has him as number one Dynasty pick next year I think that's obvious but where you take them in a redraft next year  like he's top three now  has to be right  I mean I don't know how you don't  and he's proven all these Skeptics so he's too skinny he's not gonna be able to play I mean Pop's been babies in him but yeah I mean the minutes count is back up he played him back to back their day like I I think he's gonna play the whole season and right he's gonna put on some weight in the offseason he's gonna pump some iron  and that just the the  endless potential is everything we thought it was gonna be like it's it's too much fun yeah and I'm with you dude like last night I had Luca on my TV on my left and I had when be on my TV in front of me and I watched both of them play basketball and now I went to bed yeah I saw everything I needed to see staying with Spurs sheddy Osman  8 of 12 4 3 pointers 20 points  three boards to deals to assist to steals you know A wise man once said Jonas that the cheddy pill is a tough one to swallow yeah would you ever take a cheddy pill  we should probably phone in Matt's Drew here but I mean this is this has been your guy for the past 10 years unfortunately right  but he's not really my guy but yeah I know he he's sort of my guy yeah but I would say along with the same  the wavelength is the Harris Barn thinks I think this is pure showcase right trade deadlines coming up Spurs are gonna want to move some Fringe veterans I think Doug McDermott and cheddy Osmond are the two key guys that are gonna go most likely for a second round pick like nothing too crazy but yeah I do think they want to move those guys and after last night it's a great time to do it  yeah and Chevy I think just got hot last night and just started knocking down three he's actually in my 30 team lineup instead of Jayden Hardy and so I you know some Some Nights the cheddy pills go down easier than others and that was that was a good one and for those of you who don't know what we're talking about I once told Matt Stroup that  the cheddy pill is a tough one to swallow but sometimes you just have to suck it down and we both started laughing so hard we were crying on the air  just you have minutes stick around and answer some viewer questions sure pick a few I got I got a few minutes  all right let's see what we got  let's start with this I haven't read the whole question but  um Sega wants to know would you drop Denny of DJ to add Harry Barnes or Derek Lively in a 12 team points League  I'll start with this why in the world is Derek Lively on your waiver wire doesn't matter the format I think she grabbing immediately the thing about this though is that I really like auditions well I did I feel like I've Diesel and Lively are two mus roster players think Harrison Barnes on the French but surely he has someone else he can drop because I want both Lively and not Visa  well that leads us right into David's question thoughts on of these I have my nine cat 12 team and he's been getting less playing time with the new coach should I be worried Jonas  last few weeks has been rough I will admit but keep in mind are the Wizards gonna be buyers or sellers of the deadline  sellers right kuzma could be gone who knows what's gonna happen when Jordan Poole you know they they may want him back a whole lot but if they move a couple more Fringe players including their point guard right they got Jones there a Visa very very capable playmaker I still think he's going to be a really really strong play down the stretch well and Denny was awesome he was super hot there for a while he was double doubly and putting up really nice numbers I've been trying to sell camo on why I like any of these and now he's kind of in a funk I think he breaks out of it again I I'm not too worried about Danny I I don't I wouldn't drop Denny to get  to pick up Harrison Barnes I think it's stick with Denny right but I might cut Denny to get  Derek Lively if I need a center for sure  um  JJ Styles once know what's going on with tari Eason I'm giving up and moved on  he went on three game Run got hurt and we haven't really heard from since where you Jonas well he's going to be clear for contact this week according to our latest RotoWire blurb so I think now would be a good time to stash them yes you do you are a little concerned that you know Whitmore is really really taken off but keep in mind that Ethan can play  to make at least three positions right the Rockets are very versatile I think now would be a good time to pick him up because he was really really strong beginning these sorry the beginning of the year  I like that I I moved on I just I don't have time to wait sorry and if you can stash them on aisle spot I'm good with that I'm not gonna  I'm done I'm  it hurts too much to think about Brenda  so I've held on the oniki a conquer all season but now he's the last man on my roster  do I hold him still for the trade deadline is Capella moving I mean my answer is if you've held in this long were this close to the end of the road with capella and the trade deadline you got to hold him to February 8th  absolutely and Doc the Atlantis specialist what are the chances Capella's traded give me a number  68 68%  all right I'll go 90% in the road this is the end of the road for capella a lot of changes coming to Atlanta  they need to make some changes man they're terrible yep awful  how do you feel about IO do sumo's playing time with the bulls that's from Jerry Lynn  Jonas still very sporadic keep in mind though Patrick Williams is going to be out through the All-Star break I think the reevaluation date is two weeks it doesn't mean he'll return right away so I like to Sumo a lot but also keep in mind Julian Phillips had a really really strong game last night I think he had 11 points limited minutes so I think he's definitely someone you want to watch very very closely over the next couple weeks and keep mine too Chicago could be sellers that would help Philip's lot  also Alex Caruso man how good is he been  well he'll be good until he gets hurt again right that dude is made of glass so we'll see threes blocks and steals though I mean he blocks are it's crazy he's been awesome I'd rather have him right now than than I but maybe like I agree maybe he's not available oh that's wrong one  color I didn't mean to click on that damn you set up any DFS yet Jonas too early in the day man it's too early in the day I haven't either uh let's see here I was gonna click on this one hello  Maybe  hello from New Zealand  we do not use our waiver wire ads on the trade deadline  do we not use our waiver wire ads on the trade deadline and who are your top three to get traded  Clint capela is up there Deonte Murray is up there for me I mean did Jonathan Murray's gone right he's gone yeah D'Angelo Russell Dawn I was gonna say Russell did D'Angelo Russell and REE hot American traded like 10 days ago when they were crying on the sidelines so like what was that all about Jonas no idea no idea I feel like it was closed and I feel like they pulled the plug at the last second we don't know where but I do feel like something was agreed to in principal and then they backed out got cold feet  sometimes they leaked things just to get a reaction from fans you know we seen this many times before they'll leak a trade that's almost done they'll leak it out see what everyone's talking about and they'll pull the plug I've seen it many times um so there's some trade guys who else is getting traded is Jordan Poole  no he has no value he's a negative trade for Jordan Poole know I would say Royce O'Neill and Dorian Finney Smith are 100% gonna get traded I think they'd be huge additions to a contender  and Jonas I think  manua brings up a good point  Now's the Time and not really this week but the deadline I think is February 8th  you want to have as many of your pickups left yeah the trade deadline as you can possibly have so so the couple days leading up to the trade deadline you you want to try to hold back and not make moves so you have your full arsenal to go make pickups once the deadline happens whether it's a guy that got moved or a guy that benefits from somebody getting moved yeah when I when I first started fancy like 10 years ago doc I used to always stash a couple of players in the deadline and took me 10 years to realize that that wasn't the move you know speculation kills so it's better to just wait keep those two or three ads and just wait to the deadline and use that that FAA B so the Fab a Dita is here every single week  every week Janice like I love it  Eric Gordon or Max strus or are they both just streamers in a 12 team Yahoo League  I would say Max is just a little more than a streamer and I think Eric Gordon is definitely just streaming territory until Grayson Allen is fully cleared I should say but I like I like Max a lot more  man Max was Max is looking really good early in the season he's boarding  he was scoring he's banging threes he still does some of that but I I'm kind of on Gordon until Grayson Allen is back um spruces in Cleveland right  yep that's where our guy Merrill is and  careless Levert and all that I don't know  I'm more on Gordon but they're both sort of streaming to me yeah I agree  it's indeed Again Luke Kennard still hold his knee worries yeah we talked about that  I don't know that I'm holding Luke Kennard I I'm not afraid to play Luke Kennard if he's gonna play right I would say for now yes but I think it's fluid  here's a here's a Ben Simmons sob story from Matt Carvey I had some of the stashed on my Iran wanted to wait and see how he did 12 games yesterday I didn't need him hopefully that doesn't end up being his best or last game of the season Matt  but we talked about that kick off the show I'm out on Simmons he can he can he can go off from now to the end of the season and I'm gonna  I'll pretend like I don't care even though I may really bother me  Jonas is kind of in Jonas is good on him I'm all the way in Doc  um Brian B says hey Doc and Jonas is time to start thinking about picking up  now I don't know if he saw my Andrew or Aaron  Aaron's been playing a little more for the Thunder he could benefit if Jalen is out I assume he's talking about Andrew I think Warriors who has actually been horrific all season long he's been terrible the last couple weeks he's been better I think the reintroduction of Draymond Green back in there is helped a lot he's actually has success next to comingo for the first time all season 2 so there's ever a time for Wednesday to get it going it's now or else he's getting traded so I would say yes  um here's some good stuff okay can you rank my bottom players I need to figure out who I can drop a manual quickly Kobe white Wendell Carter  Brandon Williams Josh Hart Keegan Murray that's tough man I'll answer that question you should not be dropping any of those players I don't know what format you're playing in but I can't imagine dropping any of those guys can you doc  that's what I'm saying I mean if I had to drop one of those guys I don't I don't know yeah I can't think of a single trade that would open up a player with value that would you know pass guy unless that's like an 18 right which there are such things out there in fact I helped I hope this kid  this kid drafted to team is the ESPN like charity thing yeah and there was a it's an 18 League you were  an expert is teaming up with a with a kid to help them draft a fancy for the first time check out this starting five Jonas all right we only play Five Guys I've got Joel embiid Victor women Yama Damian Lillard Kawhi Leonard and James Harden oh man well you're gonna be fine until James Harden requested trade from your team but other than that that is just stacked well we screwed up and I I missed the fact that Joe Allen was out last night I could have played Brandon Miller instead it's a point it killed me but anyway that that's pretty fun and then  okay so we answered that question there's another one here I really want to get to this  just be  just be a good good way to maybe go out Jonas be once know  who's your favorite player of all time both current and retired  well  I grew up a Kobe fan  love him to death I think by far my most favorite player of all time is Kobe I'd say currently it still Jerry and Jackson Jr but wimbee is closing in Wendy is 100% closing in he's just  you know I can't hear every time you tune in he just does something you've never seen before so JJ is still number one dear to my heart you know got the Nostalgia with him but doc I know who you're gonna say but go ahead and say it is yours well we're gonna go with the human highlight film Dominique Wilkins as my favorite retired player and my son and I got to hang out with him at the Hawks game their night this happened to be  the same Hawks game  that a gentleman that wears these shoes dropped 73 points  on the Atlanta Hawks that would be Luka doncic and I went from you know Cameron and I were talking last week like is Lucas still really likable because he complains a lot and he's got the fans throwing out and all that  but yeah I'm still all in on Luke I could do that was that was the best time I've ever had at an NBA basketball game I probably been to 500 of them so yeah um  they was right up there with I was at the Reggie Miller push off on Michael Jordan playoff game in Market Square Arena when that place exploded and that that was the coolest thing I've seen since then  let's see if we do one more  one more  can we  no I don't like that's not really a question uh yeah we'll do this  flood gaming says Andrew Hart  I mean I think he should be rusted everywhere right Jonas yeah but I do think he's also a sell high right Pacers are gonna get healthier real soon All-Star breaks coming up you know Pacers could be could be buyers getting into deadline too you never know so I would still say he is a sell high but if you have him right now I think you're happy  all right click subscribe  like do all the things you can do with this pod you can try RotoWire
