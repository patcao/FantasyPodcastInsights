Steve Alexander Dr a it is Tuesday February 20th  this is the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast  that is Brian Rosenberg from the Manchester we're going to talk some All-Star we're going to talk some Nets since he's a Nets expert  we're going to look at some  maybe hot free agents  since we're in the middle of this long break and take some of your questions so let's do this  Brian what's happening  not much it's an honor to be on this award winning podcasts  what are you eating  pistachios have been in my car for how know who knows how long  and why are you in your car  it's my kids are so loud and the house  okay  all right those are all very good answers your hair is looking particularly tall today  I think the Skylight is accentuating its height  okay well I'm I'm I had a dream about this podcast early this morning and I was I was walking down the stairs backstage  at a venue that Guster was playing at and there was a man standing at the bottom of the stairs with really long dark black hair and it was like it was cut really it was it was Jimmy Butler's haircut you know his email cut that he did at the beginning of the season and when I got when when the guy turned around it was you and you had Jimmy Butler's emo hair  and then I woke up it was awesome  yeah that's that's a great dream  about Butler's hair from early in the year was a revelation and we people should have been talking more about it  really and the fact that it is in his bio picture now like when you look up Jimmy Butler that's the hair you get that is the hair that was on your head when I when I woke from the Stream anything's possible  um  all right so apparently you did not watch the All-Star game is that correct  I kind of check out of the All-Star festivities in general it's it feels very separate from my love of the NBA does that make any sense  and it makes a ton of sense I I looked at the box score on my phone and saw the Luca wasn't doing anything  and I saw that Dame was kind of going off for the East and I was like there's I'm not turning that on I never even I never even turned it on for one second my son was downstairs watching it  um but I just I and I tweeted you know I tweeted on Wednesday or Thursday like I don't know why people get so excited about the All-Star game because every single year  as soon as it's over everybody's like well that was a travesty I wish I would have never watched  and that's exactly what happened again this year like 200 and 280 or whatever like  I don't know man I and I don't know how to fix it I don't know that it'll ever be fixed I don't think he's guys um you know they're on their spring break and  they don't really feel like playing defense and there's no  there's no competitive reason for them to try really hard in the All-Star Game the only thing that  the only thing that's gonna make them try is if they have personal competitive Pride which they may have personal competitive pride and still not try in the All-Star game so I don't I don't know what the answer is but I mean basically unwatchable  you know what they incentivize the in-season tournament by offering them Financial rewards which is bizarre for us to like see these guys competing in the middle of a  NBA season for extra cash that seems odd to me if they do that for the All-Star game it's gonna be even worse the worst part for me as a fan is just how long the All-Star break has become like he's over a week right of that were off and for those of us who feel giant empty voids of sadness in our life when Fantasy Basketball goes away it can be a hard time of year a very very difficult struggle to get through the week without without actual real basketball but you know as you know mouthwashes and first you're in second I'm in third in our in our main League like like I'm ready to get going again this is a big week for me I need to win I need that I need to have you not do so well and and the other thing about the All-Star break is what it does is it condenses two weeks into one long week  and you only get your four moves so you got to really be careful with those and all that all that stuff  did you watch are here's what here's the best idea I've heard so far scrap the whole thing  just keep playing do it do an in-season tournament  for two or three weeks around the All-Star break  and  have it regionalized so like you put teams in certain cities and they just they have many tournaments and then they all meet in Vegas or wherever and play the finals and then have the dunk contest  and the Three-Point Contest during that weekend of the finals for the actual in season tournament that people care about what do you think about that  that's terrible  I just don't want any of it I don't like the in season tournaments the one thing I did like was seeing that Charles Barkley race against was it an old official and fell down and kissed on the lips I thought that was funny  they should just do that just have potato sack races with Charles Barkley I'll tune in to that kid two weeks off I'll do that that's awesome dude because when I tweeted out that you and I were doing the show today together somebody on Twitter was like  oh queue up the 2018 references for these for these two old guys that are coming on to talk all star game or something I don't know what he said but it's funny that you went back like 25 years straight for the Barkley kissing  the refried it was the old it was old dude I can't think of his I can't think of his name  oh it's too bad I just think Charles Barkley is a great Ambassador for the sport I love him I'm not a huge fan of like Kendrick Perkins when they put him on the TV is am I veering this podcast into a direction I shouldn't  no I think you're okay  I love Barkley  I think you're fine I don't think either one of those dudes are paid by RotoWire I think you're I think you're good  yeah I love Barkley too Barkley Barkley is not a fan of this All-Star game thing he didn't like what's going on but all right let's talk about your Brooklyn Nets because as I understand it Brian you live within walking distance of going to see the Nets play basketball is that correct  and you can get cheap seats these days  how often do you go  you know I go a few times a year my kids will go and we caught an overtime game early in the year which was fun so they mainly they just want to get the fourth quarter McDonald's promotion where you get free fries if the other team misses two free throws in a row that's all they care about and like I'll buy you fry fries or three dollars and just we can watch basketball but yeah I can walk to Barkley's and it's it's great I just wish the team felt a little bit more exciting right now  well I mean I guess it does right because Jacques Vaughn got fired yesterday  we're getting it  bringing in Kevin Ollie right  former Yukon guy yeah and we and the team still attack your best player  is  Malik Beasley right  me call me call Bridget Michael  who is Malik Beasley  I told you I didn't write anything down and I don't write anything down this is what happens and I we haven't had NBA on TV in five days  this is what happens okay Bridges it's the senior moments are to be expected when you are a part of our generation Steve but I'll say this Nicholas Clarkson is really exciting to watch but the key to this team  Ben Simmons  yeah  the hard thing hey if you would just play he could be fantasy relevant on a team that's punting free throw percentage he could he could put up nine points nine rebounds 9 assists every night like who doesn't want that like I Draymond Green triple single  I don't know what the plan is here they got rid of Dinwiddie I I don't really know the way forward and I'll be honest that just kind of moved over to being a Knicks fan which is really actually exciting well I'm kind of excited about the Nets because Mikhail bridge is even though I don't know his name and think he's Malik Beasley who I don't even really know who that is I think I was a player from the 80s or 90s maybe I don't know  um Michael Bridges is still a really good player is should he be an alpha dog she'd be a number one on NBA team probably not but that's that's where we are  with Dinwiddie out of the way cam Thomas and Dennis Smith Jr  I don't know I I feel like they can go on a run I feel like they're going to like playing for Kevin Ollie I feel like this is gonna help cam Thomas  um you know what else is incredible about the Nets Brian  please  help me and they play four times next week right and then the week after that they play five times they have a five-game week it is time to pick up Ben Simmons  it's time to pick up any net you can get your hands on  because that five that five game week is gonna be killer  and there's a lot of there's a lot of Nets that are going to be  going to be playing a lot of minutes that week and cam Thomas is one of them and I've got him on my 30 Team league I'm fired up about that  Nic Claxton is going to be really good that week cam Johnson is going to be really good that we if they play all five you know that's Sierra thing that's the flip side of the five game week is we'll guys even play five games anymore and if I'm game week  I can't Thomas is gonna score a lot of points he's not going to play a lot of Defense Dennis Smith junior can still play you can still throw down a dunk like making himself look like John Morant  he is an exciting player he's  I don't think very fantasy relevant so yeah you can you can go dabble in some Nets in your league but you're gonna You're Gonna Want Ben Simmons on your team for the next couple weeks yeah  it just makes me yeah it makes me uncomfortable it should  um  so this week that we're currently in the second half of a long week at Yahoo and ESPN leagues  there are some one game weeks out there Memphis and Miami only play one game this entire week  that is happening on Friday night  so bam antibiotic hero Vince Williams Jaron Jackson one game Friday night that's it  um the three game teams this week are weird because there's one two three four five six seven eight there's like 12 14 of them  but they all play  Thursday Friday and Sunday  except for one  and the problem with playing on Thursday Friday and Sunday is there's at least 10 games on all three of those days so even if you pick these guys up  you may not be able to plug them into your lineup because there's so many games that day now there's not any games this Saturday go ahead Brian it what you're talking about is the advanced NBA hashtag grid here it's the the number one tool for me am I allowed to promote them here on and on RotoWire when I consult that thing it always comes up with the exact week we're on list the teams the games played that week and it has the chart of who's playing Thursday who's playing Saturday so if you want to stream players and maximize games played which you know is a smart way to do it in a in a NBA fantasy league like the ones we plan I go there I make the move I get a Thursday Saturday guy in exchange for my Friday Sunday guys that would just be on the bench anyway  yeah and rode a wire has that tool in their tune in  their what's the in their itinerary in their itineraries not the word you want that's like when you're scheduling to go to the airport and do your trip it's in there  yeah it'll come to me getting old sucks Brian did you know that and  look at people I'm like I used to know your name how about in their repertoire in there yeah there you go a little bit of Francais for little French in their little French in there but okay so back is three game we think so the Orlando Magic if you're looking for a team that has an alternate schedule to what everybody else has  it is the Orlando Magic so they're Thursday Saturday and Sunday and so I think there's only three games on Saturday so that's the you're gonna need a player you're gonna make a three a three-man  three game player move I think Orlando is the way to go and you can probably find one of their many point guards available on your way of wire  along with maybe some some Fringe guys that might be  worth using but it's not ideal it's not a great  it's not a great week to me scraping me waiver wire  and then the teams that have the good schedules coming up I mentioned the Nets they go four and then five um Cavaliers Grizzlies heat Timberwolves  play four games each in each of the next two weeks starting next Monday so Calvin calves Grizzlies heat Timberwolves back-to-back four Gamers and then you can go to any schedule grid and look at it but there's there's a lot of teams that finish up with there's teams that still have five out of  five out of the final seven weeks left they'll have four games per week so you know and these in these final weeks where it turns into the Silly Season closing out your your fantasy win is often about managing your injured reserve and also you know avoiding the guys that are going to get rested so the guys on my list are guys on on crappy teams I'm looking at like guys like tyus Jones and Jeremy sochan and I don't say anyone's name correctly because I just read the name and you know I think the guys that got traded recently like Daniel Gafford could be really exciting he's probably already on a lot of rosters but I think he's going to get enough minutes in Dallas to like be really effective put up a lot of blocks a lot of rebounds so some Alex Caruso these guys on like crappy teams could really like shine in last couple months  yeah um  I I think silly season is a real thing I think we're there  for a lot of these teams I know that possum ski Brandon Page just got picked up and one of my Yahoo leagues  so if he's sitting there I think you automatically  have to have him on your team a guy like Kelly oubre could be sitting there yeah waiver wire I think he's worth the look any of the guys in Memphis go ahead I want to hear about your Grizzlies but I was gonna ask about Paul jenske is he a better pick than kuminga seems to just put up points and a few boards and assist but doesn't really get defensive stats  it depends I mean both of them are must have fantasy players right now like really Draymond Green just said he wouldn't trade cuming go for LeBron James and real life right now and poem is taking over for Klay Thompson taking over the world I mean you want both of those guys on any roster you can get them on I think most nights pushy is a little bit better of a my understanding of this Golden State thing Curry reached out to slap clay 5 clay totally distant the next day clay was benched and came off the bench and scored a zillion points I know the second half of that is true I didn't hear the part about clay  not responding to Steph Curry's Dad it was it was a straight up like I'm pretending I don't see that you're reaching out to for a high five here it was I think in the wake of the curry saying he was okay for them to trade clay was that a story  I just reminded I don't know I Tommy beer Claire de Lune I just read whatever they say  I just know the clay has been struggling and then the other day was finally like I fell okay  and then he got benched after another poem ski big game  and then he went off Off the Bench but I was not well in Golden State clearly  these are not things are not great but um GG Jackson in Memphis Vince Williams in Memphis those are guys you want on your team  and these are all guy I'm just reading right off my roster Brian from our league at this point  Denny of the DJ have the playing really well actually did you see what he did last week no I'd like to know I'm fortunately I can't reference it because I'm in my car of waiting my children  um he had  43 points and 15 rebounds the game before the break  wow are you stunned I am and and is that sustainable he had 43 and 15 the game before they had a he had 25 and 7 he had 21 and 13 he had 24 and 11 I'm gonna pick him up right now actually you can't he's on my team  and my other League's where people aren't quite as a student oh yeah you should go do that and then Dante didn't even chenzo is still on my roster now if he was dropped in your league  I think you want to go pick him up I think he's gonna be dropping a lot of Threes a lot of points the rest of the way I think that next team is going to gel with OG with heart and steam and Mitch robbing the minutes and even changes a big part of it you know they cleared out for him when they got rid of quickly and RJ so yeah I'm with you and Ben Stiller's with you oh geez out for a little bit longer mitts out for the year wait I thought coming back is Mitch Robb coming back oh yeah  I thought Mitre was out for the year dude  oh man let's get your producers to check on that and and calling us back get back to this on that real quick I think he's I think he's I would like to know because if he's not out for the year then I've been  is there somebody comments here is anybody watching this you can tell us at Mitchell yeah  I'm just gonna pull  start Encore activities after the All-Star break  well I'll be damned look at the one in the Bongo players calling their  he could return before the end of the season okay I'm not running to pick out pick up Mitch Robinson but I heard your guy I'm not picking up precious either  why  I I think that I think that I heart is days away and then his relevance is gone  I don't know man pressure's been so good  feel like Precious is made in impression on Tom Thibodeau people are out there like right now like these idiots like they don't know anyone's name they're supposed expert doesn't even know that Mitch Robb is coming back let's give me took we take All-Star All-Star break off every needs a break right  yeah I I think precious is going to maintain some fantasy value  even if Hearts team comes back heart's time  Dante even says he's dropped nearly pick him up  I've got wimby out here just bawling I love that can take George score like 35 the other night keep telling me about this Jeremy so Chen guy  got your money so Hand  he's a power forward that plays point guard for the Spurs anytime you can get a pgp you want that guy on your team  I mean you kind of do and it's kind of cool  I think he's been putting up relevant fantasy stats lately but like I said I'm in a Honda Odyssey  no you did not tell me you were in a minivan  got the weather looks fantastic and Brooklyn though look at that look at the Blue Sky through the sunroof  yeah I'm not in Brooklyn  oh  you're in an undisclosed location are you are you on a yacht right now  I'm in Upstate New York we're on break just  it is gorgeous blue skies 38 degrees you remember when when I was in Key West and that that reader that Watcher was like are you on a yacht nice and I was like no I'm in a hotel room  but I'm close to Yachts I can see lots other guys that I have got on this team Brian I've got the Thompson Twins both of them I got him in I got off Sarah  camo thinks  amen is going to drop off because  Houston's going to get healthy and stop running him as hard  and he thinks he saw Sarah is going to go off in Detroit because it's silly season and they have no reason not to play him I think both of these guys are going to continue to go off I mean you really have to keep a close eye on guys like this because they can carry you at the end while you're like hoping that DeMar DeRozan returns to like form and then these guys are just putting up crazy numbers sometimes you have to like let go of your older dinosaurs hi  he got  the guy on my list that I was gonna ask you about  on a new team what are you think of PJ Washington  dude I think Dallas won the trade deadline I think Luke got help like you said we've got PJ Washington there now we got Danny Gafford there to help Luca we've got Derek Lively coming back  we've got Josh Green playing well we got Timmy Hardaway playing okay Kyrie is back playing well I I'm so psyched about my Mavericks down the stretch I they actually like for someone who mocked them at the beginning of the year for only being Luca and a bunch of rookies they seem to have like a legit team now I will say I forgot about Lively coming back so are there enough minutes to go around between Moxie Clubhouse and PJ and Gafford in the middle how can we assess the relevance of that situation well I think gaffer is going to play because Gafford is a master shot blocker he's a veteran I think they traded for him because they wanted him out there I think it's Gonna Hurt Lively It's Gonna Hurt Cleveland I think people what PJ Washington's going to play a lot of minutes because he shoots threes he does inside outside things he's going to make that team better here but I think they'll find enough minutes to go around for everybody but  you know Gafford is as must roster as they come right now like he he should  go completely off the rest of the way he's putting up huge numbers in like 23 minutes a game and I think that number should go up I forgot about Lively but yeah he seems like a fantasy stud if he gets the minutes and yeah I don't know about PJ I don't know if he's gonna get enough minutes either but  I'm I'm a Mavericks fan I you know I actually like Luca now  I used to mock you for just drafting him first and now I'm like oh I see his qualities  you know and he's been a here there's been a likeability factor about Luca with all his complaining to the referees and all his constant whining over the years but he's really toned it down this year he's hitting more of his free throws he's being more of a like I'm gonna go out here and have fun in pregame and shoot a bunch of crazy shots and laugh a lot and then I'm gonna laugh a lot during the game and and have fun with my boys and my teammates and I just feel like he's a much more likeable Luca right now than he was say two years ago when he was  complaining like Lebron after every single shot know I'm sure there's Luca haters out there they're like oh he's still complains way too much which is fine but I feel like he complains a lot less  yeah so the haters out there I would say how happy can you be when you're number two guys Dorian Finney Smith for a decade  well and I was one of those people man I was like how bet the under on Dallas B wins because there's no way that they can win all these games with Luca by himself and just you know sometimes Luke and Kyrie but he's actually good enough that he is carried that Team all the way through this season I think they're the number five or six seed right now and if they get up to three or four he's gonna Luke is gonna become a serious MVP candidate and  he's he's odds are paying a lot of money right now so if I had a  extra hundred dollars laying around it probably throw it at Luke and win MVP  imagine if they still had Brunson on that team  no kidding do you have any I had Bronson winning the Three-Point Contest by the way in it it did not work out for me  hmm you're talking about all star festivities weekend again I am I'm back I'm back to that Brian do you have any other any other guys on your list well what about when we go through our League's transactions or players like two sitting out there who's been hot in the last couple of weeks  any of these guys  get your attention  I really I mean like is Gordon Hayward coming back he got traded he's supposedly is gonna play for Oklahoma City after the break we just don't know when I mean I got him I got Tori Ethan on my list I know we talked about him weeks ago and he's been injured but he was actually putting up real statistics and he should be back so some of these guys who are getting healthy over the break might want to be on your radar well that's the thing I'm scared about what Tories and is he gonna come back and wreck  I'm in Thompson I hope not I think  I don't think you will I mean we wouldn't waiting for him for three months still haven't seen him amen's kind of becoming trenched  playing every day practicing every day I think you gotta let it amen play he's a Cornerstone future of the franchise what about Duncan Robinson Miami  I should've named one of my kids amen amen  and I mean  he's Duncan Robinson he's gonna shoot high percentage threes  and he seems like a specialist to me but he's probably getting enough minutes I don't know what do you think he's playing good lately  you mean Jimmy has been out  right Jaime's been kind of banged up although he's back I think I liked Duncan Robinson Eric Gordon with Bradley Beals injury is sitting out there on our waiver wire  Bradley Beales heard again who knows how many games he's gonna miss the Eric Gordon is worth a look Corey kispert  Silly Season specialist in Washington yes Corey kiss for will have a 40-point game before this is all over  I just have you the highest Jones the last few games has been putting up monster numbers like 16 assists tonight and I don't know I just feel like some of those guys on crappy teams are really gonna  get a chance to inflate their numbers  Josh Green sitting up there John conquer and Memphis sitting out there like these are all guys you look at picking up Kelly Olynyk totally unreliable for Portland I mean playing for Toronto  but  is going to have some big games  how many of times have we picked up Kelly Olynyk and said this is the time this is the time he's gonna get a real chance he's going to be consistent and then buy a few weeks later he's not on your roster Dennis Smith Jr just sitting out there I don't want  you don't want him no because Ben Simmons is too Mighty and powerful he's back and they're gonna they're gonna play hymn Dennis Smith Jr is not any in anyone's plans  I'm I still don't trust Ben Simmons to get through the season how many games has he played like seven oh no he's gonna play a game take a game off play a game take a couple off guys sounds amazing let me let me stop what we're doing right here and run out and pick him up you know my roster  I got two minutes and I got to drive my kids somewhere two minutes you said 40 uh anybody does anybody asking any questions yes that's where I'm going Jason's old is helping us out dick bavetta was the referee that Charles Barkley kissed on the lips I love that lumine wants to know  would you rather have Derek Lively or Paul Reed  in a 14 team 9 cat Lee  I would rather have Paul Reed I think he seems like the guy that you would put in when embiid would go down in a Stream ring situation for your FanDuel and then you would be disappointed  um dub Force like Malik Beasley plays for the bucks dude and he's probably on like three of my teams I knew I knew I was pulling Malik Beasley from somewhere he's a three-point specialist for the bucks I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to feel like I was like an idiot like me  thanks Brian  um who else we got here Malik Beasley is the current bug dude that's so funny I know that like I know this I've been doing this oh my gosh um  what about I assume that's from spur 72 I owe the movie I still think is a good pickup  I like him but I like picking up bowls right now that that are going to get a chance  right you need a piece out of here right now I feel like you do  yeah maybe I should have one of one party statement yeah leave us with your partner thoughts  yeah do it  grab Ben Simmons and if it doesn't work out  come find me  how is that that was great all right that was really really good I think you could have got a little closer to your phone but I probably should have better advice than that  I was gonna be dramatic about it something of actual value if you're gonna show us your nose hair and get all up in your phone you should probably have something better than Ben Simmons but that's okay that's all right all right go take your kids to wherever you need to take them  thanks for coming on thanks for humoring me through the Malik Beasley disaster I'm going to go through a couple more questions here if we can and Brian we will see you down the road bro thanks for having me Steve I'll see you in March I hope  okay  Brian's gone Don Cario Brandon Clarke he worth a stash I don't think so just because he's been out all year and  I think Memphis is all in on the kids at this point  I I just find it hard to believe they're going to bring Brandon Clark back for the last three weeks of the season and let him fall out maybe they will  have these guys are going to be bouncing in and out of the g-league  some maybe they will but as of right now I'm not  Brandon Clark's not really on my radar but I guess he's worth keeping an eye on but I  there's 20 other players you can go stash unless you just super deeply  Jabari Smith from the Rockets thoughts on him  he's having a good season not maybe not meeting expectations season but  he's fine  I'm not as worried about as I am guys like tari Eason and Emma Thompson  but Jarvis Smith I don't know if you're asking like is he okay to be on your team is somebody you should go try to pick up but I think he's having a fine fun year and there's not anything wrong with him  Yuri is here Luma is here from the Philippines  we might says yoga Janice Smith or Luca and  Marvin Bagley  I would say Luca and Bagley  as far as news for niece Smith we need you know RotoWire is the place to go check that out I guess I can look at it right now but  getting MRI on shin  that's old news yeah we just don't know on him I'll take a healthy Luca and Bagley please in that scenario what other comments yeah  safety says a feast says  so that's me trade James Harden and John Collins for Kyle kuzma  jwill Barry Smith  won in your opinion is that the same  that's why he asked me about Jamari Smith  I would help I would hold on to James Harden and and John Collins dude Kyle kuzma probably going away during some Silly Season at some point  yeah I think you want hard and hardened and the Clippers are trying to win it all they're trying to make a run do not trade James Harden  keonte George or Trey man now this is a great question from from Gerald Gutierrez um keonte blew up last game Trey man has been super hot for the last  his three games he's played in Charlotte he's been awesome so I think this is kind of a coin flip I think for me  I like Trey man just a little bit more because I trust him a little more but if Trey man is not available and I can pick up keonte George right now I'm picking up keonte George so the answer is both with a  tip of the hat to train man  good morning guys Force read or GG Jackson  it's time to give up on Keegan Murray  him and Thompson tremend keonte are the pickup options  I mean I love amen I love Trey I love Kiana like those are my three guys right now so I rare I might rather have all three of them over Keegan  as far as read or GG Jackson I think I just  trust Reed  a little bit more but I like Jackson Moore as a player  I'm gonna say Gigi  I'm gonna say GG and Trey man are my answers there  is Denny have  the why do I say have Deja it's obvious is Danny a must have played or drop Lively orphan or man you're not dropping Gafford you're not dropping man  because of gaffer's presence and because of PJ w  I don't know that Lively is his must have as he wants was I mean that Gafford really  stifles him quite a bit so if you want to drop Lively  to pick up Denny Avenue I'm okay with that Denny's been fun for me look at his rankings I mean he's  like 109th or tenths around value for the year probably but  he's kind of been he's kind of involving lately and he's confidence as turned the corner and I like it a lot and it's fun to have on your team  so yeah I'm gonna say if you're gonna do that drop Lively Do not drop Danielle for Do not drop Trey man all right last question  then I'm out of here  would you move on from Jade and Ivy once Chris Paul comes back punking threes and turnovers  you know I don't I just don't know what new Detroit is doing Monte just keeps playing his guys keep stifling the kids  Something's Gotta Give You you know I've read some things about his job should be in trouble  stuff like that  I don't know man  J and Ivy and austere times and still have  plenty of time to be silly Seasons superheroes when Detroit stops trying and stops caring by trying to win games and just starts tanking it up so I don't think I'd get rid of j90 yet and plus we need to wait until Chris Paul's back but  it's it's worth looking into but I still think Jade and I'm going to finish up strong but  we'll see all right guys kamla and I will be here at 11:00 on Thursday  with bells on  that will be  that will be the day that the NBA is getting back on their way Cam and I can talk a little bit more about the schedule if you guys didn't catch all that plus it's in my RotoWire column for a weekend recap I really took a deep dive into the schedule and  it's worth really focusing on if you want to win your league because  that's that's what you do it in Silly Season so we will see you on Tuesday at 11:00 thanks for coming and sorry that I forgot who  McHale  Malik Beasley was how is wrong with me see you guys
