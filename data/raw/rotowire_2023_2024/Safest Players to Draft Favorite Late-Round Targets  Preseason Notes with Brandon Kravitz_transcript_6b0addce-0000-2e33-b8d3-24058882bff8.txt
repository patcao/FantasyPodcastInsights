welcome into a Wednesday edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast I'm Nick Whalen joined as I will be every Wednesday throughout the NBA season by my good friend Brandon Kravitz Brandon we were just comparing weather here as I am in southeastern Wisconsin you are down in Florida and somehow it is the same temperature in Milwaukee as it is in the greater Orlando area today so we have we've reached that time of the year and I think that officially means that we're less than a week out from NBA season absolutely I've been wearing a long sleeve shirt for almost 24 straight hours now it's a wonderful thing I mean it's a welcome addition to the outside scope here in Florida because it's been humid hot and disgusting for as long as I can remember so whenever you get the chill in the air it is always a welcome to the feeling it's good and bad all right for you that because once you feel it you know it's things about to go south quickly for us it's like exactly it's gonna be 80 degrees by next week it's going to be 41 degrees by the middle of next week here in Wisconsin so those of us who enjoy the great game of golf those days are those days are coming to an end very quickly so I'm gonna get out a couple times this weekend and I think that's gonna be the final hurray for the year but we did not come here to talk whether we did not come here to talk about my very pedestrian amateur golf game we get a lot to get to on the show today I want to run through some pre-season notes you know pre-season coming to an end soon we've seen most teams now and actually three or four times a couple teams finishing out their slate as the week goes along we're gonna talk about an article that I put up on the site early this week detailing you know if you want to have a safe draft or you want to have a Subway Safe draft and you want to know which players to Target in each round we'll talk about you know some of our kind of safety valve players that we could always fall back on year in and year out but just kind of Jump Around hit some other news items I just saw a tweet Brandon indicating that James Harden is a no-show at Sixers practice today I like I still feel like we're one well  what what's the what's the goal here at this point if you're if you're hardly it's still to to force some sort of trade but like why show up in the first place practice but not scrimmage you know be around the team and now he's away from the team like I don't really know what levers he's exactly trying to pull here you know that there was some reporting you know unsourced or at least anonymously sourced yesterday you know that the Sixers are starting to Canvas a little bit more aggressively as far as you know what a James Harden trade might look like getting some other teams beyond the Clippers involved I still think the most likely scenario given that we're six days away from opening night is that hard and opens the season with the team but I don't know if he's gonna be out there at opening like I still think he'll be a member of the Sixers but do you do you expect him to play in their first game of the season I don't so I've actually changed my tune on this the last couple of days I don't think he's gonna be on the team but by the time this the season starts I know that it's coming coming up soon we're only a few days away from that but this is a situation that as James Harden has said himself does not repairable the Sixers have a high expectations this year they can't start the season with a headache like this you're not going to get great value that ship has sailed a long time ago you just have to move off of James Harden get what you can they know that and it seems like he's willing to play hardball in terms of not suiting up he said that he just wants to play basketball but I think it was with a dot dot dot implied not for you so I don't think he's gonna be on the team he'll probably be he might be traded by the time we drop this episode it's possible it's possible you know I I think the fact that it's Daryl Morey on the other side of this and he's like the one GM who I feel like has the the best track record of not being pushed around in these scenarios I I have a hard time believing that he's just going to cave and take 60 cents on the dollar for James Harden but you know it's got to the point now where I think both sides would like this to be resolved before opening night and that pressure is only going to turn up before we get to the middle of next week in the Sixers play their first game you know is there any other team that you could see emerging other than the LA Clippers like I I don't know what team is lining up to get James Harden right now I think there are some teams that are probably monitoring this and saying okay you know if we could see him play for a couple months and it's he that he's engaged and see that he's still has it you know maybe later on depending on how our Seasons going we would consider bringing a player like that in you know you think of a team like the Heat or I don't know the Lakers who are always open to bringing in any big name player but I think those teams feel pretty good about where they're at right now I wouldn't be aggressive in pushing the Clippers on that deal I think if you're  the Sixers and you say you know let's just you know for the sake of conversation you want to trade him by opening night I think my goal would be getting a third team involved because I'm not I'm just not thrilled with what I like it off here like I'm not I'm not the biggest Terrace man guy I know they're calling him like borderline on touchable I don't I get it he's looked okay you know when he's been giving the opportunity but if that's the headliner that I'm getting back for James Harden I'm not psyched about it you know it could be someone like Norman Powell who's you know a good 15 to 18 point per game guy off the bench that's fine but you know unless you get another team involved as the Sixers I don't think you're gonna get anything close to what you know Peak James Harden gives you  I think the most likely scenarios he gets dealt for it's actually if it's the Clippers and unprotected first round pick and then if you're Philadelphia you cross your fingers and hope that the Clippers end up dealing with the injury bug and that turns into a really valuable commodity but I just don't think you're going to get a player of any substance in return at this point I know it sounds crazy to say James Harden at his best is really good player there's just there's not a big market for him the seasons about the start all these rosters are locked in and the Sixers want to get rid of him a whole lot more than these other teams seem to want to bring him in I do think the Clippers make the most sense I've thought that all long Far and Away at the top of the list there are a couple of others I think Minnesota would be interesting to add another piece to to their offense I mean if the Raptors wanted to try something different I don't see them making a move like that I know people keep throwing Miami out there I think there's a less than 0% chance he ends up with the Miami Heat Jimmy Butler has had a hard time getting along with teammates over the years because because other players he's played with aren't completely locked in and committed to basketball James Harden strikes me as the kind of guy that would drive him absolutely crazy  so there's no question about that I agree with you I also like part of me just as a basketball fan just out of pure curiosity I kind of want to see him in Miami to see if that's the one organization that could get the most out of him right like for the most part they've they've avoided you know these wouldn't say troubled players like that that's not really fair to James Harden but guys like hard India they tend to avoid but I think you know some of these same criticisms that were we have about James Harden right now we could have said the same thing about Jimmy Butler when he was you know forcing his way out of Minnesota on national television and you know you go to my Emmy and you kind of get with that organization you get with that coaching staff and they have a way about you know maximizing players especially players like hardened who we've kind of questioned you know what kind of shape they're in to begin Seasons like Miami does it doesn't deal with any of that you know so I I do think that there's a case to be made that if there's one team that could kind of get James Harden where he needs to be at this point in his career it is the heat but I think Miami is content to kind of sit back play this out at least until you know midseason trade deadline and that's you know when they would hopefully you know another Super are Shakespeare and potentially make their move after striking out on Damian Lillard I do want to ask you you know if you think James Harden is being dealt in the next week or so but what does this mean for Tyrese Maxey you know his composite ADP right now we have a great page on rotowire.com you can compare ADP from ESPN CBS Yahoo Underdog fan tracks all the main sites you know Maxie's at 60.2 right now he went 56 overall in a 14 team Roto League that I did last night if you think hardens out the door and they're not bringing back another high usage star in that deal which seems unlikely does that mean that you're willing you know to push Tyrese Maxey up you know half round or maybe even a full round absolutely I think a full round sounds like the right sort of move in terms of the way his value would increase with James Harden not on the floor we thought last year was going to be that big breakout for Tyrese Maxey he really just kind of steady and stayed the same he did not have that big breakout season we were expecting without James Harden I think that statistically you would get that he's improving or you you at least think that his stage in the game that he should be taking that next step it just seems like he had a little bit of a plateau but with James Harden not in the way I'm somebody's got a score other than Joel embiid so you would expect some really big Nights from Maxey yeah I like Maxi a lot you know Roto or points I don't think there's a huge distinction there although and Rodeo leaks you know 85% at the free throw line last year that was actually his worst Mark in three seasons you know he's had some 87 88% years at the line for for a small the player as he is to shoot you know 48% for the field and back to back years it's huge I mean he was up over 43% from three last season and you know just going into his age 23 year I think a lot to like about Tyrese I don't have him enough leaks yet I took shangoo and over him you know just kind of based on my build I started Tyreese Halliburton Desmond Bane Pascal siakam with my first first three picks and wanted to get a big band there but I certainly considered taking race Maxi in round four of that Roto draft last night I want to hit some some kind of random pre-season notes Here Brandon that will get into some of the safest players to draft hit a few other topics over the next 40 minutes or so your team the Orlando Magic was in action last night they were taking on the New Orleans Pelicans you know we saw kind of a weird game for the Pelicans over the weekend they were playing the rockets and you know there were a few Supercuts going around on Twitter of like just woefully poor effort levels on the defensive end from from the Pelicans including Zion Williamson but this was his eye on that we've been wanting to see last night played 16 minutes went six of eight from the field 16 points 3 rebounds three assists five Steals and two blocks you know we have to put out the caveat every time we talk about Zion the injuries you know he's basically been a like 30 to 50 game player are you willing to take that risk this time around has he shown you enough I just being there in the building last night being able to see him in person for the first time I've always the Zion appearance has always alluded me because he's either been hurt or there was covid I could go to the building there was always something going on I yeah all all the all restraints are off for me I'm blown away this is the Zion that I that I had hoped to see when when witnessing it in person it was it was the best version of of him playing basketball plays Above the Rim played hard on defense got his teammates involved he knows his space on the floor if he's gonna play like that I mean look he only played 29 games last year that's been well documented but look at the numbers he put up when he was on the floor 26 points per game seven rebounds five assists now  he's gonna add the defense of side of his repertoire we know he's capable of it but was he willing to defend her and and that body seems like he has been working out a bit he looked more put together than than pledging which we have seen from Zion absolutely Blown Away perhaps a little still a little high off of what I witnessed last night but yeah I'm totally in on Zion I want to be in I really do I I will take him I've decided like at or around 80P he went he went in the early 40s I think it was 41 overall in the the 18 Rodeo League that we drafted last night and I I'm still not willing to go there like I'm not jumping ATP for sign we've learned our lesson on that one too many times but I like last year he was a total cross off for me like I wouldn't have taken him anywhere inside probably the top you know 65 or 70 you know this year if it gets to like you know the end of round four you know if we're talking like Shen versus Zion or Tyrese Maxey vs Xeon like that that is more of a debate to me I think you just have to be realistic about what the expectations are like if you're if you're big on Zion like and you're taking him you know early in Route 3 which you'll see every now and then like I think you have to expect 50 to 55 games anything you get beyond that is a bonus that's great but you cannot really plan your team especially in a rotilie where you're so worried about specific categories and you know kind of tried to balance risk reward early in the draft I I'm not willing to go as far as to say all right I  think you can play 65 games like you know 50 to me is a win if you get there so I think it really depends on your own confidence of your ability to find players that you think could be suitable Replacements later in the draft if you have if you think that you have those players targeted then take your shots at the point where Zion is going off the board I think you make a really good point do you want to jump 80 piece super aggressively with Zion you probably you're more likely to get burned than have that pay off but if you get him at Cost there are some of those guys we might even end up talking about them the safer players like I'm drafting him looking right now wrote a wire.com being drafted right around the same spot as Nick vujevich I'm taking Zion on every day of the week because we know what food is he'll give you that nice steady performance 17 and 11 pretty much every single night but Zions got that League winning upside down I'm just willing to take that shot at Cost I think without a doubt I am I because when he plays he is just a complete Difference Maker and  his style is so conducive to just simply putting up these gaudy stats I want to be on the right side of that  yeah I would go as far as to say that he is him when he plays Brandon really is he yeah it's 100% true I thought he was for both teams he was the best player on that I saw on the floor last night with a doubt and Franz played really well by the way  yeah well let's talk about the magic side of this I could assure you that this will be the most magic slanted basketball podcast that anybody listens to throughout the season I mean you are dies in advance for that oh yeah that's a good thing the magic or a fun team this year you know you are as boots on the ground as it gets with the Orlando Magic and I was not a great night for palaba Cairo for the most part I think he's looked really good in the preseason but two of nine last night for Five Points to just 20 minutes you mentioned France he looked fantastic he got a mention in the safest players Article 19 points for him on 8 of 11 in just night teen minutes anything else to point out either from this game last night against warlands or just some you know General preseason long trends that you've noticed with Orlando oh yeah I mean just as a team in general this isn't one single player specific but it could help bolster some of the fantasy value for these guys is that they've put a lot of emphasis into shooting more Corner threes attracted during the first half last night they attempted nine threes from the corner they made six of them this is a team that really struggled with their three-point shooting percentage and it wasn't just one guy Jalen Suggs Gary Harris Wendell Carter Junior friends Wagner all these guys it was clearly a mission from jamahl Mosley to to spray to for spacing purposes and to have everybody feel comfortable in that spot because it's the most 5% of 3 that's out there so it's a clear point of emphasis for this team if it's something that works throughout the I don't expect them to shoot at that rate over 50% over the course of the season from Deep soul and realistic but they were the 25th worst team in the NBA and in terms of three point shooting so hopefully you see that improve just based on the game plan Anthony black and  Jet Howard I think you can take off your board completely I think that might be my biggest fantasy takeaway from last night those guys didn't play until the second half this was a full dress rehearsal for the magic and for the Pelicans so last night was a good indication of what this team is what the rotations are going to look like and those two guys I know they were drafted inside of the top 11 and for Anthony black drafted inside of the top 10 he was six overall pick these guys are going to be non-factors early on in the season where do you come in on the Magic win total 37 and a half is the number at FanDuel you'll see some 36 and a halfs out there at some other books this was a 34 win team a year ago James Anderson and I did our annual wind totals pod for the Easter earlier this week hate to say it Brandon we both went under on the magic I like where this team is headed over all but part of the reason is what you just mentioned like they had two lottery picks I don't think either those guys are going to be real impact players this season you know there are other there are other huge offseason was bringing in Joe Ingles who to be look completely washed as a member of the Bucks last season so I I think there's going to be you know internal improvement with guys like big hero and bognor but I always worry about how many games Wendell Carter's going to play and you know the shooting to me remains a big concern right like if you're starting folks and Suggs and you know I think he'll shoot it better this year but went through some big time struggles that he hit like one three in the month of February last season like I do worry about the overall shooting on this team you know you could be starting like  two of the worst shooting guards in the NBA together I think the other side of that though is that false and especially Jalen Suggs are really good defensive players so they should be able to they should be able to slow down opposing guards a little bit better than most teams around the NBA so maybe they can mitigate some of that and on the nights where they are shooting well they're gonna have quite the advantage because of that front is going to be steady Palace Palace I mean I don't just tell you on that the reason why I would take the over and I know that that shocks you I'm the magic guy I'm taking the over for the wind total last year they started five and 20 they were they were just brutalized by injury they were in above 500 team from the 26th game on for the remainder of the season I think that's a better indication of what they are a team that's like 4142 and 40 or or 40 and 42 like that that to me is what the magic are right now and when you consider some of those players that the  whole Anthony markelle fultz Jalen Suggs that glut at guard these are all guys that are in contract years so you're about to get one hell of an effort from all of them we know players always play their best when they're playing for the dollars so I think I think the magic are good for close to 41 wins ah we will see we will see we'll go ahead to head on that one I still like the under especially if you're getting it at 37 and a half I think this is a team to me that that will be in the in the play in conversation I I don't know that I see them you know pushing for like six seven seed to me they're closer to the bottom end of that but very interested to see how that plays out we got to talk about somebody that I did not think we would mention at any point through the first few weeks of this pod branded Julian strawther out in Denver continuing to play well in the preseason had 12 points last night against the Clippers that was actually his worst game by far of the exhibition slate went three of 11 from the field two of seven from three but prior to that he had three straight games where he'd hit four three-pointers just coming in with a ton of confidence somebody that they traded back into the first round to get at picked 29 out of Gonzaga I you know a little bit hesitant as far as what his role will be right away you know this is a team that's still has Casey P they get Christian Braun who they're expecting to take a big leap this season I mean Justin holiday was kind of Bend this like random can play guy and I think it's kind of a trustworthy veteran on both ends of the floor I think he'll play as well and you know Reggie Jackson's in the mix that guard so I don't know that strawberry is gonna be walking into like 20 minutes a night right away but I think this is someone that at this point we do need to be keeping an eye on and you know if you're looking for just one of those like Hail Mary picks in the last two rounds of a draft like he's somebody that I'm willing to entertain now in that conversation yeah it's fun to slam the button on a guy that's been outstanding in the preseason I think this is more pre-season Fool's Gold than anything else but he was outstanding at Gonzaga seems to have rolled right over into this opportunity with Denver I just don't see where the minutes really are so this um this is a name that when he does pop up at random due to injury will go hey remember when he had that great preseason but other than that I think you'll probably you might draft him and feel you know you'll feel good about it hit that button late and drafts and then he'll be on the waiver wire sooner than later yeah I'm hoping this is not like a Josh cell be summer league conversation you know somebody that we're bringing up 10 years later be like oh yeah he was some really MVP that was a fun time all right real quickly I want to ask you about Chris Tap Sports thing is who has looked amazing through the preseason I mean I think one of the concerns with Port Sanchez fantasy wise was all right he was kind of like the the option 1A 1B over the second half of last season Once Bradley Beale was out of the lineup in Washington now he goes to potentially being the third or even fourth option on a lot of nights for the Celtics but he's been a seamless fit I think you in a very limited preseason sample he looks to me like somebody who's benefiting from playing with better players around him I mean just some of the looks that he's getting some of the wide open threes you just four of eight from downtown last night in a win over the next 20 points 8 boards two blocks in 28 minutes I remain skeptical he's exactly the type of player that I typically avoid I always tend to be a safer drafter whether we're talking fantasy football or fantasy basketball I don't like taking guys to have a track record of playing like 43 games a Year where are you at once a as he kind of convinced you to take that leap at all I'm pretty much the same way if I don't get one of those Elite bigs at the top I usually end up more safe in terms of filling out that roster spot but he does intrigued me because of his unicorn ability though we've been privy to throughout the course of his career 50% from three last night this is a guy that could not get down if you do leave them open and the Celtics are going to score enough points where if you're the third option you can still have decent numbers I would say buyer beware a little bit of just judging based on what you saw last night even though you know it's not like an oddity stat line but he also you only played 28 minutes he'll give you more than that in the regular season when he plays the Knicks he's gonna blow up so that's sort of that's my point he's gonna have his best building will be against his former team I can almost guarantee that I like Persian just don't love them not willing to reach on him I hope he stays healthy I mean it's it's significantly more fun when guys like him are involved you could say the same thing about Zion Williamson like I say I am a bucks fan I would prefer that the Bucks are the team that emerges from the East and I think the Celtics are you know the primary team that's going to stand in their way but I don't want to go into the Eastern Conference Finals with Kristofferson gets out with an E injury you know I think it's more fun if you know if all these guys are at full strength but still not ready to you know draft a guy like that in the 30s in a fantasy draft let's talk a little Toronto Raptors Brandon they get a 106 102 win in the pre-season last night over the Chicago Bulls this one you know about like a pretty real dress rehearsal I think for both sides right we saw you know most players play into the late 20s a lot of the key guys on both teams in terms of minutes you always saw I think a relatively realistic spread of what the kids could look like off the bench for both sides I'm curious to get your take on like what is the general direction for the Toronto Raptors this season like they to be one of the most difficult win totals to pick and you're getting a low number as far as the Raptors go I think it was like 37 and a half down actually now down to 35 and a half wow at the DraftKings Sportsbook it was 37 and a half on Monday when we recorded that pod so it's already on the decline I think there is there is this underlying belief that okay Toronto's gonna feel it out they're gonna see what their team is but you know this could finally be the year where you know that they look to hit some sort of I don't think it'll be a full reset you know I don't think they're the type of team that wants to go into a season and win like 18 games but you know they have a smart Forward Thinking front office front office that we trust to make the right decisions you know what do you think this team looks like early on and is there an is there a chance I should say you know that Pascale saieko and Obi guys like that could be on the move if they want to eventually reset this thing around Scotty Barnes I just I don't think they're the type of organization at bottom out so that's where I'm a skeptical on that number but clearly that's been hit by some smart money for it to drop by a couple of wins so you know take that into account but just to based on my perception of the Toronto Raptors they are they're the heat of the north they don't do it quite as well but they do have a championship in the last several years to their name because of their ability to get aggressive when when they know it can put them over the top so getting Kawhi Leonard I think it it definitely had a lot of us in the basketball Community taking them more seriously as a franchise that's willing to put the pedal to the metal when they see they have a roster they can win I'm not sure this is that roster but I don't trust them to bought them out so I think they're going to hold a number of these pieces so that they can at least maintain some level of stability do they move off of a Gary Trent Jr who they brought back do they move off of OG&E whose name  has lived on the trade block even Pascal siakam if they want to swing for the fences and bring in someone else to just shake things up all of those things are possibilities but I felt like last year was the year if they were going to make moves to blow up this roster the fact that that didn't happen makes me think they're just going to stay the course and and they're just cross their fingers and hope that one of these guys like Scotty Barnes turns into a full blown Superstar yeah Scotty Barnes look great last night 22 six rebounds three assists two steals four blocks I have not got as much Scottie Barnes as I would like this year I went went hard on Scotty Barnes last year Brandon and that worked out to to varying degrees but it was not quite the second year leap we were expecting but I think I think the best case scenario for Barnes is they do you know hit a hard reset mid-season right and I think the octave is the obvious one and you know ogna Novi I think they they value him and rightly so they value him maybe more than a lot of other teams do like you said he's been in every trade conversation for the last two years and they never pulled the trigger because I think they really placed a high value on what he could be see how come love the player you know he's one of the safest guys to draft in fantasy every year because you know plays a ton of minutes and we'll see what you know what that looks like post Nick nurse because I was something that always gave the Toronto Raptors like a 5% boost because you just do those starters were gonna play like 36 to 38 minutes every night it's a lot of teams are doing that anymore but she was expiring contract you know he he's kind of gunning for for  a potential super max eligibility and you know this will be his age 30 season right and I Toronto to me is not the type of franchise that is going to want to pay a Max or certainly not a supermax to a player of where's The Optimist add in his career right now yeah I agree but if he if he does I mean if he maintains that level of all NBA sort of status then why not so if there's if they're looking for the what is the core moving forward it's it's hard to move off of a guy like that I think unless you have a and it's it you have to keep in mind this upcoming draft is not supposed to be with this past one was there's no women coming out so you or if you're gonna bottom out what are you doing at 4 it's another thing to keep in mind when think when projecting forward so you're right about the draft but I feel like we say this like every other year you know there's not a weapon Yama price no question about that and there's as of right now there's not even a you know scoot Henderson level Prospect I think available but I feel like historically every time that we've said it's a bad draft there's always somebody right somebody emerges whether it's you know now you got all these different channels whether it's the g-league ignite whether it's overtime whether it's a college player you know I think Brandon Miller was on the radar coming into the college season I don't think you know going into November of last year anybody would have said that Brandon Miller was going to go number two overall in the draft so I I'm of the belief that drafts you know that we think are going to be bad always you talk yourself into players it's the same thing in the NFL when you say oh it's a bad quarterback draft and what happens every time you got three quarterbacks that go on the top five picks because of need and because teams talk themselves into these players you know the other thing to keep an eye on with Toronto Brandon is they owe their 2024 first round pick to San Antonio and it is protected one through six so what they don't want to be is like the seventh worst team and you're handing over the number seven pick to San Antonio so you either you either need to be confidently you know in that like middle Zone in the East where you're pushing for a playoff spot or a play in spot and you're okay maybe forking over like the 15th  overall pick but the other side of that is if you do decide to rebuild this thing and you do sell off pieces you don't like how you start the season you got to make sure you're in the bottom six because the whole point of that is not to you know be giving up a lottery pick to San Antonio so they have they have some interesting things to keep in mind it in terms of that 2024 pic yeah there'll be a fun team to keep an eye on early on in the season because if they end up out producing what we expect from them then they probably don't do anything this is this is not an organization that wants to make big moves but they'll make them if they have to I just haven't really seen them bottom out in a long time since it's hard for me to believe that they're going to do that but please remind me throughout the course of the Season that when the Raptors play the Bulls to just take the underdog whoever's catching points take that team because these teams are evenly matched yeah man well we'll talk about the Bulls on another episode that's just that's a franchise that to be is just you know they are dead set on Wing exactly 38 games with the roster they have spider been me these two teams are the same  but at least what about Scotty bars right like the Bulls don't have that that young asset that you know conceivably you could you could talk yourself into building around and you know even even in an obviously I'm like I think those guys probably have more trade value you know certainly the Boost of it does at this point and you know DeRozan's expiring I don't want to go down the Bulls Rabbit Hole this is dangerous territory we'll save that for another week there before we talk about the safest players to Target at each round we got a couple messages to pass along from our wonderful sponsors

live right and I mentioned at the top put up a piece that that you could find out rotowire.com and also went up on Yahoo fantasy Basketball so check it out on one of those two platforms the safest players to Target in each round and obviously when you're talking safe players in any sort of fantasy game the number one thing that comes to mind is games played right and that is that is at the Forefront more than it's ever been in fantasy basketball these last two seasons especially I think have been extremely frustrating you know I've had a couple weeks that have converted from weekly lineups to daily lineups just because of you know how much variance there's been in terms of games missed I know the NBA and they continue to implement you know small changes to try to Spur players into playing more  I'm not of the belief that we're going to see a massive turnaround you know I think maybe over the over the long term that might be a trend that the NBA can get kind of work on but I don't think you're over here you know all these guys that played 60 to 65 games or something going to be playing 707 708 games so this is something we're going to be dealing with year in and year out the important thing for me when I go into a draft especially early on you want to find that that risk reward balance you don't want to take all safe players but if you're if you're drafting Kyrie Irving in the second or you're taking Zion Williamson like you want to balance that out and make sure that if things go awry with a guy like that that you have you know some safety to fall back on so I went through I broke down the safest player to Target in each round talked about some of the honorable mentions you know other safe players and in Route 1 it was pretty obvious you know I almost felt bad you know writing this one up because everybody's like duh but Nicole yokich part of what makes him so unique in fantasy it's not only does he have the highest upside of any player in the NBA I think you could argue that he's also the safest of all the superstars  yeah I don't know how much we need to sell people in Nickelodeon's but I completely agree he's he is the one oh one for me without a doubt I actually just did two Underdog drafts just a couple of days ago and you know they place you randomly in their best ball drafts in terms of your draft position that's not like you know you have to like race your friends or anything like that for the season long leaks I wound up with the number one pick in both and I did not overthink it I just took you both both drafts let's just load up on that I'm fine having yoga shares this year yeah and that's about exactly what I put in the piece was like if you're at one one don't overthink it technically yokich there's been really no reason to believe that that's not the safest investment you can make and you know look at some point he's probably going to get hurt but he's been wildly durable I think there's something to be said about you know he's been criticized for his physique but I also think there's just something about like the the lack of strain I think that he puts on his body especially during the off-season like in a roundabout way I think that actually helps him in the NBA he's not somebody that's ever you know put a ton of time into his body and for the most part it's worked out for him so I'm not gonna tell him to to adjust that you know he's averaging 74 and a half games per season since coming into the league which is you know extremely high especially when you compare it to a lot of the guys that go in round one so not a whole lot to say there yeah I mentioned Jayson Tatum as my honorable mention you know the great thing about Tatum is you can often get him you know five six seven sometimes you know even later in the first round and there are certainly players with more upside like I don't  think in a best case scenario Jayson Tatum has like number one overall player upside but you know is 80 P right now is 5.4 if you take about five you know like worst case scenario it feels like he's gonna return like late first round about you yeah he's a guy you know exactly what you're gonna get he's been steady over the years and and I think he still has MVP an MVP level season in him we talked about that on one of our prior episodes I actually think he's a good value at MVP and he's if he's able to pull off something like that or anything even close to it then he's gonna return that value and then some so yeah when I get to that that range where the guys that that should go ahead the obvious yolk is Duncan bead Janis I'm taking SGA over Tatum but I think right after that I'm going I would take Jayson Tatum over Tyreese Halliburton I don't know where you end up landing on that yeah I think I would have done the same thing last night in our in our Rota League I actually ended up taking Halliburton at four over SGA Kata went three in that draft believe it was an auto draft situation so I I would would have been happy to land Tatum like that's that's exactly the type of draft that I tend to to lean on especially in a rodeo League like I love Luca  but the free throw percentage for how many he takes and how little Improvement there's been like that that really is kind of a killer and Tatum is just you know so well rounded across the board I don't really I don't really worry about you know the arrival of porzingis and holiday impacting him too much you know if anything you worry about maybe Jalen Brown Take It a slight step back and in terms of usage but I think Tatum is pretty solidly installed as their number one option you know in Route 2 and you know we won't just narrate my entire article I will say that but these are really well picks are fun to talk about you know I try youngest who I settled on  for by safest pick at Route 2 and I think there is a there's a disconnect between how we think about Trey young in real life and how we should think about it in fantasy I mean he's been a top 15 player in four straight years he's got a pair of top five finishes in that span for a player who has small and slight as he is he's been remarkably durable yeah 73 and 76 games the last two seasons I love this I love the fact that you teed this up in your article because you're 100% right we view Trey young as a guy okay well I mean it regular season success the guy can't get it done in the playoffs you get that one blip of the Eastern Conference Finals appearance but and then there is that perception that gets hurt all the time but the last two years that has not been the case and I like the fact that Quin Snyder has up the pace they're up about 15 spots in the NBA in terms of just overall Pace from their days of Nate McMillan being the head coach so more more Pace means more possessions more chances to score the ball does tend to stop with Trey but I think Quinn Snyder is is starting to speed him up a little bit and he's not down threes you're going to be very happy having him on your roster  well and if the ball stops with them that's great for Fantasy that might not be great for the Hawks but that's exactly what we want I want the ball to stop at tree Young's hands you mentioned the three-pointers that's that's something to monitor because it's kind of been every other year for him like first year in the NBA you know he struggled early on was about two threes per game second year when he really broke out you know almost average 30 3.4 made threes per game the year after that he's down to 2.2 that he was back up to three point one and then last year was back down to two point one yeah I think we we think of Trey young as like this junior version of Stephen Curry but in terms of volume that is really not been the case he has moments where he he steps into the Oklahoma version of himself but he he really does he gets to the rack really well and he utilizes that part of his game mid-range is there and yeah I would actually I would like him to shoot more threes because he's quite good at it  yeah no question about that you know percentage wise he's kind of gone every other year as well I mean he was 38.2% in 2021-22 down to 33 and a half last season so I guess I guess history suggests that this is the year that he you know bounces back and it keeps that Trend going and gets you over three three pointers per game which obviously is huge for Fantasy Route 3 to be is really interesting there's a lot of safety in Route 3 like that that's actually one of my favorite routes to draft because I feel like you always there's not really a player who typically goes in Route 3 where I would say I don't really feel good about that pick you know it's like you got like LeBron is falling around three and a lot of drafts I for the most part skeptical just because of the games played with him but like just a Murray you know Trey Young's teammate in Atlanta he's been remarkably durable as well as you know upside in terms of steals Pascal siakam is the player I ended up settling on we've already talked about him so we don't have to go into a ton of depth but bam out of Bio was another player that I highlighted as well I think with bam like there's still like a little bit of lingering disappointment for me because you know I think it was coming out of the bubble season you know we're thinking like man this guy this guy could be like at the end of the first round type of player if he continues to develop and he's gotten better at the things that he's already good at but the fact that he is not been able to expand his shooting range to me is a disappointment and Miami's been just fine without that you know the shop blocking is kind of come and gone a little bit but in Rhode Island you know the fact that he was an 80 plus percent free throw shooter for a guy who was hovering around the mid 70s early in his career like that to me is you know been the biggest boost to his fantasy profile not a player who has I wouldn't even say you know top 20 top 15 upside but if you're taking him at around his ADP of like 32 33 I don't see a world which are disappointed  well and that's what this is all about your article is about safety and delivering on expectations sometimes you want to draft players that are going to deliver the output of where you drafted them exactly and he's been able to do that you pointed out in the article he ranked 30 seconds 34 21st and 31st respectively over the last four seasons so this is a guy that wherever you take him you know in that range he'll give you that if he stays on the floor and he's proven that he can do that as well yeah so in Route 4 talked about Jalen Brown you know another guy who's he's had some minor injury issues but for the most part I feel like is pretty safe you know get a good to give you third maybe early fourth round value depending on how many games he plays we already touched on Boost I mean he's been he's been as safe as against he's played 70 games in five of the last seven seasons played all 82 last year but he is 33 and you do feel like at some point you know maybe there could be a fall off coming talked about Julius Randle in round five another guy who I think is fantasy profile doesn't necessarily match up with with how he's valued in real life what do you get into round six round seven that's where we started to get variants like there's not there's not really such thing as like a rock solid safe option when you're talking about picking in the late 60s and that's kind of why I settled on France Vagner and it's you know it's tough when you when you're talking about a player who's only been in the league for two years but I love what I've seen from Bob I love what I've seen from him in the preseason he was barely missed any time I think he's missed what like five total games over his first two season  but you are more qualified to talk about Franz Wagner than me so is there is there another leap coming for him in year three I think he can he can take a step up a leap I don't see because he's already playing like he's a five-year vet I don't think you can look at this guy like oh it's he's entering into year three SO waiting for that breakout I think he already is who he is but who he is is a really good safe and steady player he's an Iron Man he plays through ankle injuries all the time it's not that he doesn't get hurt it's that he's one of the rare players in the NBA that actually plays through his injuries yes I know it sounds crazy and he's hot right now too coming off of the guys just played so much basketball recently played Euro basket last year FIBA this year he's played almost all of his NBA games that he's been available for in this preseason he's shooting 75% from the field so I'm not you know that all of those things he's gonna be the most steady producer on the magic Knight in and night out even more so than aloe will give you the Splash games France is going to give you the same stat line every single night yeah I think he's the  he's gonna like take the torch from my khris Middleton and Tobias Harris as like just those those perfect safety valves you can always get like a round later than you should be going in fantasy draft because people don't get excited about him but this is all about like you said this is about balancing your roster you're never gonna win by going risk every single round you're never going to win going safe every single round so can you balance those two things and France is the perfect balance too hey if you took Zion the round before go ahead and take friends and you know in that range  all right I want to hit on a couple more players and then we'll talk about some late round values and and get out of here for the day  Rudy gobert  Rudy gobert was a major thorn in my side last year I think he is the sole reason that I ended up being a buyer in the RotoWire stake League I spent way too much on him that was an auction format and somehow I got him again in that League I did not want to believe me that was not the goal but he he went for like 13 dollars cheaper than last season basically it was a situation where I couldn't let Ken Crites get him for like 15 bucks so I ended up you know tried to try to bid him up a little bit got stuck with him but I think I got him for like 16 or 17 in a 200 dollar budget which I was okay with his ADP in draft Lee's is 64.4 right now that's right about where he finished last year Am I Wrong to to think that last year was the Baseline and if he does that again and you take him in the 60s so be it you live with it it's a lot different than taking him like 25th like you were last year is there about back here or are you of the belief that you know Rudy gobert's best days are behind him it is crazy when you look back and think of how excited we were that he was with the Minnesota Timberwolves and just how man just how yeah I mean that ADP last year absolutely ridiculous did that was I was so in on that team I actually went and look back we did a like preseason you know fictional thousand dollar Futures bets and like myself and James Anderson were like just pounding Timberwolves that's left and right  yeah that feels like last year is what he is fifth overall in the NBA in terms of rebounds scores about 13 points per game which isn't that different from what he was doing in Utah He's giving you the blocks I mean that dropped off a little bit last season I would expect that to bounce back he's an excellent defensive player you you've been mentioned free throw percentage a number of times on the Pod today you're not getting that from from Mr gobert so you kind of have to just that sort of thing that's that's part of the course for for most bigs in the NBA but yeah I think last year is Baseline is a good way to put it I feel like that is that is who he is you're not going to get a better version of him but I I can't imagine that he is continuing to slide in the other direction I think we may have just overvalued him and more than anybody Minnesota did I mean he's only 31 right I think if he was he was 33 34 I would not be rostering him in any league but I love the belief that there could be a minor bounce back like I'm not saying he's going to come back and be like two and a half blocks 14 rebounds a game like those those days are probably gone and you know Carl Anthony talents is also probably playing more than 29 games this year which I don't think I don't think really hurts go bare all that much but it's really doesn't help them the more that towns is in the lineup we didn't see much of a change in terms of his production with or without towns last year you mentioned the free throw percentage that's always an issue I guess at least he's taking like two fewer free throws per game so it's maybe not as damaging as it was in years past but you know 64 65% that's something you're gonna have to work to either lean into and punch or or try to offset in a roto league but you just need him to like like the points of rebounds I'm not that concerned about like if you just gives you 13 points and 12 boards again that's fine but it's got to be the blocks like he could be there I mean that was his Worst season Mark since his rookie year he had half as many blocks last year as he did you know with Utah two years ago like that just can't happen like even if you just gets to like 1.9 or 2.0 blocks per game you could live with that and I think he'll be a decent value but yeah I'm waiting into those Waters pretty trepidatiously but I do think if you for a guy with this track record he's also been wildly healthy as far as like 72 big men go not many guys his size play as many games as he has you know over the last decade so I I do think there's a little bit more safety there with gobert then you would think everybody feels like they're just completely out on him I want to ask you about Buddy Heald as well his ADP sitting in the low 80s I mentioned him as one of my favorite safe players to Target in round seven you know since buddy hield entered the league in 2016 he is number one in total games played by 23 nobody else is even all that close he's number two in total made three pointers with 1,705 he brings behind only Stephen Curry in that category he's finished second in the NBA in total made threes in four executive Seasons I actually like them I think you can get them at like 30 to 1 to lead the NBA inmate 3s this year which is essentially just a hedge against Steph Curry you know if Curry goes down and plays like 50 games I think Buddy hield might be the guy that could step in and finally get that title but what worries me is the the trade potential here and he's one of those guys who's kind of been like half on the trade block for a couple years but after extension talks stalled with the Pacers this offseason like that that's seems more realistic than ever I think as of right now based on what we've seen in the preseason there's a pretty good chance he comes off the bench behind I don't know that that really kills him but I still think he plays a ton of minutes but it's not a good thing the question is if he's moved is that something that could you know negatively impact his value relative to the role that he's held in Indiana for the last couple years yeah well you mentioned the bathroom was still able to put up numbers coming up the bench she was clearly that's six man role with Indiana still able I wouldn't let that scare you off too much I think he's being under drafted based on what he's able to do from three-point range I don't worry too much about where he ends up because if a team is trading for buddy hield that any stage in the season they're doing that because they want that tool in their tool belt of what he brings in terms of three point shooting you're not just adding him so that the so that you can put them on the bench it's a new shiny toy that you don't use so buddy hield should be involved wherever he goes now in terms of the best case scenario I don't want him to get traded if I've got buddy hield because I love the way the Indiana Pacers play basketball very fantasy friendly and so I would like him to stay and if you have him that should be what you're cheering for here but I wouldn't be overly concerned with where he ends ends up because it's gonna be a team that needs what he brings to the table they're going to use them a lot whoever it is all right let's finish out with talking some late round values you know if you're talking like round 10 and later you're just looking for some upside you know oftentimes I'm actually targeting like some some degree of safety with those picks you know it's kind of a time to look at your roster especially if you're in a league that that differentiates between like point guard shooting guards ball forward power forward you know kind of make sure you have some depth like I went to a League last year where I kind of was not really paying attention like doing the draft on my phone and realized that I had like one small forward eligible player on my roster and you know if that player goes down obviously you're going to be in a bind so you know it's kind of a combination for me where let's say you know your last four pics of a draft like two of those I've targeted High upside guys you know guys who I could be drawn I could be dropping three weeks into the season but guys who have conceivable upside and then I want you know I want to just kind of build that almost like a real NBA roster at some positions that I'm not quite as strong at one of those guys for me every year if it's a zubac nobody's excited to draft Dubach here he's going on average about pick 128 in drafts this season but you talk about a guy who plays 70 plus games every year he spent 72 or above in each of the last four seasons and two of those were 72 games Seasons keep that in mind as well so we didn't miss any time in 1920 or 2021 you know kind of just a points rebounds and a couple blocks type of guide I shouldn't even say a couple like you know 1.0 block for him is fine the field goal percentage is big and he's certainly not a plus at the free throw line but he's got an 80% season under his belt you know he's he's about a 701% career free throw shooter but I do have some optimism that he can bounce back and that regard so he's again not going to be a plus in the free throw percentage category in Roto league but to me he's also he's also not somebody that's in like the Andre Drummond Zone he is a double-double machine I was just looking up real quick where he ranked in terms of last season overall it was around I mean he was like in the inside the top 20 so this is a guy that for the range that you're getting him at absolutely you know what he delivers he's gonna give you a steady amount of points he's gonna give you a ton of rebounds and he had some monster games last year from what I can remember so they definitely a guy you talked about a depth piece that can help you out how about Zach Collins of the San Antonio Spurs going at consensus 132 a more valuable player than I think some give him credit for in terms of field goal percentage occasional three can rebound averaged 11 and 6 last year and I'm kind of looking at this in the attention that wimby is going to get in the paint is that Collin's is going to be left alone so this is a team that's going to be in a lot of high scoring games I think he could get his so he's a depth piece  that I'm looking to add and he's almost free yeah I'm with you on that I know perutha is a big Zach Collins guy I think he's taking him in every draft that I've been in with him and I do think we've been Yama helps him a tan I think the attention that he's going to command on both ends is gonna help Zach Collins kind of settle into more of a super role player role which is probably good for him I mean you do forget he was a lottery Pick and I think expectations have kind of changed with him since you know all the injuries that he dealt with in Portland and you know kind of felt like his career was almost on the brink for a couple of years there but bounced back with 63 games played last season if you just isolate the 20 games in which he played more than 25 minutes he averaged 16 and 8 with 4 assists a steal and a block per game 53% from the field he's you know kind of a borderline Plus at the free throw line hovering right around 80% I mean for a center you'll take that every day of the week so I like that call quite a bit and you know what was San Antonio we're certainly gonna worry about the direction of the steam especially over the second half but I don't really think that college is in danger of like being shut down or being limited you know obviously they want to get looks at web  minyama and Jeremy Sohan but beyond that it's like I don't think you are holding exact columns out so you know Andrew Steele and Charles Bassey can get more more tick it was a phenomenal pronunciation on your part but his Xbox he's an Xbox I had to know that  I got I got another one that I always this guy's I think he might be on every roster that I've drafted and that's Jade and Ivy going around pick 111 I love his explosiveness I just loved what I saw from him in college and I think enough of that translated in year one and his NBA career not afraid to shoot it from Deep so there's a good chance that he finishes I would say finishing number two in scoring for the Pistons is virtually a lock for Jayden Ivy so give me give me all the ivy I can handle I go back and forth on Ivy and I do think they're going to bring him off the bench and much like buddy hield I'm not sure it matters I think he'll play enough minutes that you know starting versus coming off the bench is kind of a wash and there's a case to be made that you you kind of want him maybe operating as a number one option with the bench unit as opposed to you know a distant number two behind Kate Cunningham who's gonna have the ball in his hands a ton this Detroit roster by the way is just bizarre right I mean the mix of like high upside young players that we like cuttingham Ivy Azar Thompson and then like why is Albertsons on this roster why is Bowie on Buck and if it's still on this team Joe Harris Monty Morris like they just have all these random veterans that I just wonder are they gonna force them into the lineup are they gonna try to trick themselves into thinking that they're further along than they are you know my hope is that they offload some of those guys and then you know the front court is obviously just loaded with with guys that I don't really love for Fantasy this year other than Jalen Duren I will say on Ivy like I I have avoided him everywhere last year I thought he would be I thought he'd be more of a hindrance then he was in Rolex and as the season went along you know I think that the percentage is especially started to fall off like he was he was 41% from the field was not a good free throw shooter in college that carried over he was about 74 75% last season so that's what I'm looking for him to improve right it's like can he can he be a 44% shooter can he be a 78% shooter at the line because I do think the county stats are going to be there like in a points League I have no problem taking Jade and Ivy and expecting him to give me you know 16 four and five even if that means he's coming off the bench  yeah he's an exciting player he's gonna get his opportunities so they this is a team that's still needs to figure out who they're foundational pieces are chances are dating Ivy is one of them a can I sell you on Colin Sexton that's somebody I've been taking you know with one of my final picks and a lot of leaks you know composite ADP of 127 you'll see it go higher in certain formats to see him go lower another formats you know I was I was kind of in on it last year as well you know going to Utah like all right yeah this could be a spot for him to rehab his value this is a team that I think we're still not quite sure what the what the short term direction is yeah I think they have some nice pieces in place but there's still not really close to you know contending for a title or anything like that I I just don't think they look back like comment section that back to back 20 plus Point per game seasons in Cleveland didn't give you a whole lot else other than that but you know kind of medium volume on three-pointers you know three four assists per game one steal per game good free throw shooter take that but I do think there's more upside with Sexton that most of the players that you're going to be looking at in the 130s OR 140s it's another team that's going to score a lot of points so that that leads me to I end up with a lot of jazz players on my roster for some reason or another Collins Sexton has not been one of them but you you did it you did a decent job in terms of selling me on what his potential was able to score 16 points six assists in the in their last preseason game against the real NBA team so I mean this is a guy that is he is going to be a factor and a team on a team that is going to be in a ton of high scoring games the Jazz had a lot of fantasy producers last year I just I just not a total buyer in terms of the talent and his lack of outside shooting really bothers me that's fair that's fair and I do worry about where he fits in like he's still young but he's not he's not gonna be young enough for the Jazz who I think want to get looks at like keyonte George who's look good in the preseason you know Taylor Horton Tucker I think is still in the mix for the starting shooting guard spot so they they have other guys in that backward that I think they may they may prioritize their development over comment section you know getting his 18 points per game so that's that's the main concern for me any other late round guys you want to hit on quick yeah there's there's one more that is more of an affinity play for me because saddiq Bey of the Hawks is it was he was on my daily fantasy Ross orders during some of my most profitable days so he's like my lucky penny I gotta have Sadiq fail much on my roster a lot of mouths to feed in that Hawks offense but he still got his last year after his trade from Detroit 12 points per game in Atlanta shot 52% he's good for a steal per game and if the Jonathan Murray or DeAndre hunter ever have to miss time it is  to the moon for my lucky penny Sadiq Bay that's funny you say that because I feel like I've had the complete opposite experience with him in DFS and in season long it's like I'm just always rostering it with the wrong time but I get it I mean I think he probably starts at the four for this team right I'm you know it's kind of beige Jalen Johnson Hunter and Griffin are all somewhat interchangeable on the wing but I think you'll be the guy and I think that was part of the reason that they were comfortable you know sending John Collins to Utah and not really getting any any major like we now piece back you know I think they were just kind of content dropping him and saying all right more minutes for saddiq Bey so I think that's a good call there you know for Fantasy or obviously you're chasing the points in your chasing the threes that's about it with him and he takes so many threes that it harms his field goal percentage like he's not a bad shooter but you know when I'm trying to look at his total I mean over half of his attempts and his career I've been Threes And even though he's like a 36 37% shooter that's just going to drag down your percentages by default he's also been close to to one steal per game over the last couple of years so  if you goes from playing 22 23 minutes to 28 29 minutes most nights that I think it's conceivable that he could push over one steal  yeah we just need Clinton Schneider to convince him to shoot some more tools and then we'll be in the money with I mean you're getting them right now 139 yeah last pick so the big the last pick for me in a couple drafts has been herb Jones and you know there's there's a bit of a gluts on the wing for New Orleans that's been the case for the last couple of years but it's also it's also had a way of just working itself out partially because Zion who you have penciled in for like 35 minutes a night just doesn't play so that's kind of that's kind of my head for you know if things go awry with Zion and you know for the most part I've let somebody else take that chance I think herb Jones is just there as the steady guy who could fill in you know he could play shooting guard you can play on the wing he could defend up a position if he needs to you know Trey Murphy is another guy that I like but you know he's coming off of a knee injury tours meniscus over the summer I don't think he's gonna be ready to go until probably mid to late November and if he hits the ground running and picks up where he left off you know I think he's somebody with higher upside but herb Jones to me is kind of the the ultimate safety valve on this Pelicans roster and you know two years into the league 1.7 steals 1.6 deals per game he's been a decent 3-point shooter as well I mean not nearly the same volume as Trey Murphy but  yeah when you talk about late to draft kind of checking in on your different categories like all right where do I need a little help here if I'm white on steals I'm always grabbing herb Jones late yeah and he's almost like a handcuff like you said for Zion because his value would shoot up of Zion has to miss time which you know is gonna happen at some point it's just a matter of hope it's not too much time for those that have Zion or for NBA fans in general but herb Jones is probably the most active player on the floor that I saw for New Orleans last night everybody else kind of picks their spots and you know Brandon Ingram is their focal point offensively but herb Jones is kind of flying around the court so guys like that are always gonna always gonna be an important factor of any NBA team  yeah he has been starting in the preseason and again we'll see what you know one tree Murphy's back that could be his spot on the wing but I do think herb Jones probably opens the season as they're starting three any other players you want to hit on before we get out  I think I'm good all right all right man well we're over an hour here so we will we'll be on our way out
