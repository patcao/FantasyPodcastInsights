welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by us free trial rotowire.com slash try today is Friday March 1st 2024 Alex baruta here with Shannon McHugh and Ken k train Crites all aboard  happy he's these guys yeah happy to have these guys back after we dropped them to streaming carrying Sprecher last week you might see him later in March yeah let's go on there um let's jump into the news we've been Yama destroyed Chet homegirl and the Thunder versus matchup in San Antonio despite the Thunder being I think 11-point favorite on the road  us first get the win 132 to 118 wimby can take you to be insane 2813 and 7 with 5 blocks and two steals it is the third time this month that one banana has had 25 10 and 5 with 5 blocks in a game only cream and Hakeem have done that Shannon would you take Victor when the JAMA number one overall next season he's in the conversation he's been the number one raid player over the past week over the past month he's been the number three ranked player in fantasy basketball that's yeah number three in 29 minutes per game the only other player in the top 10 averaging less than 34 minutes per game is Chet homegrown over that over that last past month so I think Wendy is in the conversation already you have to assume as he matures and he's going to be afforded more minutes and so if you've got just the same production we were seeing this year and his rookie season over the past four weeks  you apply 32 33 34 minutes to that Eddie's easily in that conversation for the number one overall pick well me injuries that we expected I I certainly expected I thought he'd be sitting a lot with the Spurs being awful but he's at 54 games so what does he miss like five or six total  we'll see what happens down the stretch but he keeps playing too it's awesome he had the he had that like ankle injury that his minutes were limited you know it's as interesting I was talking about this on the XM show with Joe Bartow who's filling in for Nick last night first of all women pajamas actually very quietly number two in Defensive Player of the Year race on the odds behind Rudy gobert one but Yama before last night's game was minus 700 to win rookie the year that is down to minus 2000 after last night's game which Chet homegrown plus a thousand of Rookie of the Year so yeah um six games by the way Wendy's missed six games  all right I'll tell you this too over the past month  he's played more games than anyone else ranked in the top 10 he's played 13 games Anthony Davis Luca they're one and two over the past month and per game value 11 games each so I mean Wendy has been just a consistent study out there he I mean he moves like he's he's like seven six but he moves like he's six six I feel like homegrown to me moves more awkwardly than women in terms of like you're talking injury risk I actually feel like we're worried about homegrown but I don't want to get too deep in the Weeds on this Spurs nice to the Spurs snap their five-game skid they've been on the road for 26 days was that the rodeo did they have the rodeo again isn't that always maybe yeah all right well let's hey you know enough of the sunshine and positivity let's talk about some god-awful basketball and Washington the Wizards have now lost 13 straight after losing in LA to the Lakers in overtime last night they lost 134 131 Jordan Poole 34 points Off the Bench it's no Bernard King though I'll tell you that much he is not started the last five games but is averaging over 23 points and 31 minutes while shooting a  unsavory 40% from the field over that stretch  Lakers they had to play add 41 minutes and LeBron 39 minutes to beat the Wizards that is just bad guys his last night evidence that we don't need to take the Lakers seriously  uh well here's here's what here's what the media will tell you Ken the Lakers running back to back its that simple  no I look I think that you have to take them seriously in the sense that  you know if you if you like  they are what they ninth right now in the standings they're going to be in the play in and they could they could rise up past the plan right Could Happen um two and a half games from the Play yeah yeah I think I would take them over anybody right now that's in the play in zone like if they open a plane situation and I still think I think I still think it would make OKC like if it was okay CLA first round  I would not feel like immense confidence that okay see would win that series they should win it based on the record of everything else but you still have to be worried about the experience and and play off especially playoff experience of LeBron James and Anthony Davis  fair enough and good news for Shannon  Pistons no longer the worst record in the NBA it is the Washington Wizards who've lost 13 in a row Pistons moving on up there a half game  with nine W's and only 49 losses over the Wizards who have 50 los anything anything specific you can attribute this to Shannon  just it's definitely not due to Monty Williams  let's play Jordan Poole it's doodle Jordan Poole yes  Shannon take us to some interesting news down in Atlanta yeah I mean earth-shaking news coming out of Atlanta big for the Hawks have wave 35 year old Aussie veteran Patty Mills Patty Cakes 2014 NBA champ with San Antonio he's played 879 career games with the Trailblazers Spurs that's and Hawks he was a vocal leader for Australia's national team the Boomers scored 42 points in the 2020 bronze medal game versus Lucas Slovenian team to earn Australia their first Olympic basketball medal  Bravo Patty we're gonna miss Patty Robert Patty Cakes know he's a bit of an iron horse at one point from from Four Seasons 2015 to 2019 you only missed three games and he had a back-to-back 82 game seasons  trying to look up something  else this time of the season when these veterans get waived and there will be the news is like yeah this this veteran a grease to a buyout on this date so he still eligible to join a playoff team which happened with Mike muscala Pistons Legend the report for Lowe's was right be eligible to win join up playoff Contender almost racing  yes yes you know they're racing to get Mike muscala who is 32 could not carve out a role with the Washington Wizards or the Detroit Pistons this year I'm sure he's going to fit right in with a playoff contender correct I I can see I can see Patty you know just quietly signing with like Phoenix or something you know they don't really have a point guard but yes your point is very it's for players who are not like Patty Mills and Patty Mills might not even play a single playoff negative you get signed by one of these teams so  yeah  all right it's time for fan feedback  Alex did you have a point you wanted to bring up I'm sorry  I did not fan feedback let's go question from free key  which Mavs big has the most value rest of season PJ Washington Derek Lively Daniel Gafford or a Mexican cave  yeah we should we should know about Lively I wrote I wrote about him in my rookie update article the other day  you know he he managed to play 20 minutes and back-to-back games which is nice but still has not seen more than 23 minutes  since returning from his injury basically sends scaffold got there and look he's still producing blocks numbers averaging 2.6 blocks over his past five games of gaffer that I mean they're essentially splitting minutes right and then PJ Washington see Summit Center and Cleaver see some at Center Gafford  not playing that well it's about I mean it's the situation it's a bad fantasy situation so like Shannon if you have one or both of these guys on your roster Gafford or especially Lively  are you are you trying to find ways to drop these guys would you prefer to hang on to them yeah I mean of those four players Lively and Washington are basically neck and neck over the past week in value Lively on a per game basis has been the 84th range player and Washington's 89th Washington is my pick of those four players he's the one I believe we'll have the most fancy value down the stretch you know we kind of saw this with his his most recent game he came out scored played 31 minutes 23 points six rebounds three blocks and five three-pointers he is not been shy about chucking up three pointers since joining Dallas since joining the starting lineup with Dallas which is Ben 6 games now he's averaging five three point attempts per game only hitting 30% you know what what's he once that creeps up and he's shooting 35-36 percent from downtown which we saw so far this season past couple years he was in that range you know is it his averages are only going to improve and it's encouraging to me that he's been you know of those four players also he's the only one who's been playing over 30 minutes on a regular basis all four games over the past week or over the past eight days he has played over 30 minutes so it's PJ Washington for me I've always loved his versatility and I pretty sure we called it out on the show that I we believed he was gonna have more value with Dallas it then he did with Charlotte and I I think that holds I do think he's a lot to be a top 100 player for the rest of the season  uh specific question probably for Alex  just being out for personal reasons Alan Wiggins Golden State Warriors apply for ill eligibility on Yahoo I'm pretty sure it does not  I don't believe it does  so on ESPN because we run that out  I don't I mean no so I know for sure suspension do not if players suspended they do not they're not IR eligible double checking right now I don't think it is for personal absences but well well Alex looks that up here's a basketball question for Shannon besides Schroeder and bridges who on the Nets will have the most value down the stretch  it is a train wreck their I should add we'll discuss this in waiver wire Nets are also the only team with five games next week so who do we like  is Cam Johnson a good night last night but a terrible season is there anyone else we like Claxton numbers been going down who do we like Shannon on the Nets  after yeah maybe Schroeder it is tough you know I I am going to default to clock he is still he's starting every game for them yo he is he's talking 28 200 minutes most nights you know it does it does vary 30 minutes 21 27 28 over the past four the production has been up and down over those four games as well but he still has enough upside with rebounds and blocks his field goal percentage is always getting to be solid that he is the default number two option on that team I am not necessarily confident that Schroeder is getting a hold value for the remainder of the Season Camp Thomas and Ben Simmons both set out last night so you don't you don't don't jump to conclusive shooter he said plenty of Duds since joining the Nets too and what's once campus or games when Camp Thomas and Ben Simmons are available sure just not gonna have he's not getting go off for 23 and seven like you did last night so I'm not as confident Intruder having long-term value yes while Camp Thomas and Simmons are out but when one of those two is healthy sugar gets knocked down a couple levels  um  I'm like 95% sure he Wiggins does qualify for ill on Yahoo will qualify for okay yes but we wrote a wire does not control that we control ESPN's so gotcha all right Sherman's very happy all right John we now move on to the meaty money segment of the pod  the waiver wire uh yeah and this is how this works if you've been here before and if you haven't we each have two regular waiver wire pickups players who are roster and 50% or fewer of Yahoo League's and then one long shot each 25% or fewer of Yahoo League's on turns a game count  this week you just heard Shannon talking about it Brooklyn as five games next week the rest of the league is pretty normal with four or three games I'm going to click kick things off with Jalen Suggs who I was surprised to see is only 49% rostered it's Mega Tower fluctuating more compared to the start of the season the stats of cool down a bit right but  over the past 14 games still averaging 1.8 steals at half a block averaging 11 and a half points a game with 2.33 assists and three rebounds during the stretch as well and the magic of four games next week so even if you know Markle folds and Cole Anthony and Gary Harris and all these other guards they have kind of get mixed in and sags is only seen 25 minutes a game  you get four games out of them you might be able to get eight nine steals from Suggs which is very rare to find off the waiver wire  yeah stocks are always underrated Steels are always underrated and sucks provides us can where are you going well first I'll say fans if you like our video please hit the like And subscribe buttons below I'm bringing back a free agent named we talked about over and over again for the woeful Chicago Bulls Andre Drummond is a boomer bust but they've been starting them against big lineups and they're having success with them Drummonds ranked 65th over the last seven days 26 rebounds the other night Chicago has four games next week one of those fours will be a dud for Drummond but I bet two of them are another crazy sick rebounding night if you need a sinner if you're ready about Nick's of play as of late for instance Andre Drummond is a very viable option they're starting drumming in vooch against big teams like Minnesota and look why Drummond isn't in a sixer uniform why they didn't move him at the trade lines Beyond me but clearly they're going to play him and that's why they  didn't deal him so old man Drummond 47% roster on Yahoo right now and not only getting started to get big teams but also just in general I mean if Caruso sits I believe the probably start drumming in those scenarios as well and just go with the bigger lineup it kind of matched up Cruces at the most recent game against Cleveland who has Twin Towers of their own my first free agents suggestion of the week is rui hachimura really has been crushing it for the Lakers he's made either 11 straight starts  he's averaging 16.9 points 4.5 rebounds 1.93 pointers and 32 minutes per game over the past eight starts he's only 28% rostered on Yahoo right now I'm actually very surprised that it's that low giving it's been a few weeks now where he's been locked in the starting lineup seems like the Lakers are going to stick with that or I don't know maybe after last night's game against Washington those switch things up but as long as Ruby is in the starting lineup he gives you solid production especially with points and some three-pointers  angering all those people are burned fat Budget on rui Ontarian Prince  absolutely I am going to go to another name that's frequently on the waiver wire being picked up and dropped Carousel vert 41% roster again another guy whose stats they're all up and down like just you know roll a dice on his points in a sis every night but he is still Cleveland six man and his passing is actually been great it's got to be close to a career high actually in terms of the assist right lately in February so the whole month of February 62 assists per game so giving you 10 points five rebounds and about one stock in 26 minutes the efficiency pretty bad so if you are really efficiency sensitive and like a eight cat or something maybe there are other options but the calves are four games next week so again someone who might be able to get you 24 25 assists and giving a week in a cat League that's pretty hard to turn down  I never thought he would evolve to a viable backup point guard that's kind of what's happened isn't it yeah his game he continues to improve I mean he's a better Pastor than ever and a better Defender than ever you know at some point I think they went to him and they're like if you are not going to defend we don't really need you out there we got other guys we got a Coro we got screws like we don't have to play you and I think I think he took that to heart so he's been he's pretty good all right well my second pickup is stealing a name from Alex over the last few weeks but Corey kispert is lighting it up for those terrible Wizards he's all the rostered in 29% of a leagues look hey this Wizards team is awful they have lost 13 straight and now have the worst record in the NBA but kispert is one of the few Wizards who shoots and actually shoots well efficiently last five games he's averaged over 18 points four dimes 1.6 stocks and three point four triples while shooting 48.5% from the field that's a lot of Threes with a positive field goal percentage Washington has four games next week  that's probably four losses for the wizards but Christopher's going to keep shooting because really who else should shoot on this team  and that I mean that production is coming whether he's coming off the bench he's one spot start when Ivo was out the thing that's impressed me most about kiss for is he's dishing out assist he's doing five and a half sister over the past two games so he's doing more than just shooting fundamentally sound came off the bench last night it wasn't overtime game but still got 27 minutes off the bench absolutely my second waiver wire suggestion of the week is Trey man guard Charlotte Hornets 41% roster that seems low again this is the guy who's made tons of starts he started eight games in a row for for the former Bobcats averaging e11.9 points 5.5 rebounds 4.8 assist 1.8 steals 1.8 threes in those eight starts you know the efficiency is low which is kind of hold held down is overall value not just not just that's joining Charlotte but his efficiency is always been a problem low to mid free 70% free throw shooter but he's great for points Lee's I mean 5.5 rebounds from from a guard point guard with a player is very solid and the big question here is when will lamelo ball return I'm coming back they're 11 games out of the play and they're not gonna risk  I do wonder I do wonder that and there there's a some recent quotes from the Hornets coach that's kind of alluded to the fact that lamelo even though other reports have said that lamelo has you know started restarted basketball activities everything else the coach doesn't seem to think that lamelo is coming back anytime soon or he's alluding to that fact so for me as long as the lamelo's out Trey man needs to be rostered quite a bit more heavily than he is right now I have go ahead go ahead out say I have that quote by the way I can read this off it's not it's not that long it's from Steve Clifford asked where lamelo is healthwise compared to a couple weeks ago quote it's hard to tell look he's doing the same stuff now that he was doing two weeks ago I don't know that stuff he does what they allow him to do there's a lot of factors in that obviously like today he did a lot of sugar around he's been doing that for a while he wants to be back again he doesn't feel healthy enough and people aren't comfortable enough that he should play I don't really know how to answer that he does shoot around and things like that he does his work I know he wants to get back there's just a lot of factors on that one the Hornets are like turning into the G League affiliate for OKC didn't they just pick up poke a chef ski in a dead I can't wait until we get to talk about but  big concern for lamelo I mean I worry you know after everything that happened with his brother Lonzo as well yeah like yeah it's it's troubling I wish him Health he's a fantastic player and super fun to watch but Trey man I was very surprised he was he was available in multiple leads of mine most of my League's are deeper I I believe he should be rostered until lomelo is actually back on the floor I'm glad with Trey man you made that efficiency comment in the notes you you just wrote f is low and I was like he's trained man having trouble getting late we're going to move off of that one but we will stay in Charlotte I am suggesting 11% rostered Cody Martin who has seen at least 28 minutes in eight of the past 10 games which is great I mean part part of the reason you know he's falling off the radar to an extent especially compared to his brother Caleb who's in Miami is that Cody's been hurt for a long time and the fact that he's able to play this monuments in a row fantastic but during this stretch he actually putting a good numbers 7.6 points 5.1 rebounds 4.8 assists and 1.8 stocks he actually had a tennis game the other night he was only shooting 39% from the field and Charlie has three games next week so if he's not if you're not just streaming if you're if you want someone to stream and you can't take a field goal percentage hit he's just not your guy but if you're in a deeper League against a long-term thing whatever  just keep those things in mind he he's putting up good numbers  well 10 you who you have from Phoenix I don't know this is my long shot or my boring pick of the week but Royce O'Neill  30 year old seems like he's 45 a royce O'Neill Ford for the Phoenix Suns look the sun's have no depth Bealls hurt it again he started the last two games and last five games though he's averaging 10 points six and a half boards almost four assists 2.7 stocks it's a lot of steals and 2.73 not particularly efficient I will warn you though Sons only have three games next week but O'Neil could be some monster minutes down the stretch for these sons who probably don't want to play their Stars at the end of the season either  O'Neill what do you think O'Neill's career high end points is  career high I bet he's had hot from three and had like a 27 point game 20 seconds 27 was my guess that was what popped in my head initially too it was 20 points 20 yeah but he had he had that once in 2020 21 but no I mean good point good points all around Ken this is the perfect spot for him right where you could fill in do some stuff defensively um yeah good good pick up for Royce O'Neill and deeply Shannon who is your final waiver wire suggestion yeah my long shot of the week is Taylor Hendricks forward for the Utah Jazz 8% roster on Yahoo the rookie forward has made four straight starts for Utah I have to assume he's gonna be locked into that role rest of season over the past week has been a top one 20 player he's averaging nine point eight point six point eight rebounds in those four starts that he's made and 2.4 stocks blocks plus deals and 2.13 per 36 on the season I know steals Steals and blocks have been kind of where I thought he would make his kind of it make his do as a fantasy potential fantasy impact player this year in college last year he ever 1.7 blocks and 0.9 steals he's got that extra length athleticism he can make an impact on the defensive end hasn't really done it since joining these starting lineup but I expect that'll start to show up in the Box Score soon  yeah he's he's been shooting a lot he's been shooting a lot from the corners so he should I mean it should be well first three-point percentage but he's kind of one of those bizarre players who it's like yes he's taking Corner threes but one of his best skills that's his offensive rebounding so there's kind of a weird balance to strike there but he's been really good he's been he's been like relatively speaking I think he is a great fantasy profile let's look at that way the numbers that he can put up will translate really well to Fantasy they essentially gave Kelly Olynyk away to clear up minutes for Hendricks like they want yeah to play the rest of the season  yeah and they and it's telling that they went with Hendricks in the starting lineup over Kessler as well because they easily could have slid Collins down to the four marked into three marketing played a lot of minutes at three last season but they went with Hendrix so they obviously believe  okay I believe it's time for our Friday daily fantasy picks we will be referencing DraftKings salary for the most part in this segment we have nine games today highest over under Wizards at Clippers at 2:39 at bet Rivers when I checked but there's a there's a couple other high over under us as well it's just the nature of the NBA these days let's see in terms of actually you know what kind of want to rope you into the segment very quickly before you get too deep into the comments because we have Dallas at Boston yes um you went to a Boston game the other night actually in person Sixers win fantastic yes would you ugly for zynga's t-shirt what is what you see in person and what have you seen from the Celtics lately and the Seas just toyed with Philadelphia all game they never really broke away they were up like between 11 and 8 for most of it they Sixers got within two or four within like when I was like nine and a half minutes left and then Celtics scored 17 straight the really on cruise control but from a DFS standpoint you know they don't need every Star to contribute to do well so it's kind of a crap shoe whether porzingis or ha or white or of course brown or Tatum are going to go off they have been feeding porzingis  like that Philly game when they're facing you know facing a donut team meeting a team that's got enough in the middle but that is not the case tonight against the Mavs because I think Lively is playing and I've got for the bench now so I don't see this even though it's a Revenge game for zingas I don't see this as a good night for prisoners I think it's going to be a more classic Tatum Brown night and you know holiday and white it's just a crapshoot when those guys like have numbers off the crumbs from Brown and Tatum yeah I can see this as maybe like a three-pointer knife for pros Angus maybe pick the over on three pointers and a player props situation but yeah it's good that's very good inside draw Lively out of the key I like that on offense right person is threes makes sense Shannon would you like on this slate what's what's the first place you're going yeah I think the the first game that you have to look at on this slate is Portland Memphis it's it has a very low very low we have to look at it we have oh they are new sponsors of Memphis Grizzly I I'm not suggesting you watch the game okay thank you we're not going that far but and the 208 and a half over under is absolutely pathetic in the year 2024 for an NBA game but there's just too much value to be had we already have triple Jared Jackson Jr  it's been ruled out obviously Bane Bane's out still happens out Rose Martin's light baby yeah Kennard contract both are looking doubtful GG Jackson is questionable so you have yeah Lamar Stevens you have trade Jemison Jameson you don't have more Stephen Lamar Stevens at center it's a  yes yes and he's actually been I think I'll probably pay less Santee Adama and power forward our boy Williams Vince Williams I hear Williams  well I know I mean he right now in our Optimizer he's the Top Value play for for tonight's late so clear that's just the Memphis side there's like four or five guys that I think are  strong considerations at discounted prices to plug in your lineups just from the Memphis side and then there's more of that when you look at Portland Brogden Henderson sharp all out deandre's doubtful with a hand injury so you Jeremy Grant and Simon's the two obvious ways but Chris Murray who is been receiving spot starts lately he'll probably get another start at shooting guard spot do I breathe  old favorite of the show or a new favorite from this season at least yeah he's been he's been playing about 15 minutes off the bench regularly he could see twice as many minutes with eight now tonight so there's just tons and tons of value options and you can take one or two or two or three from each side of that matchup and be able to plug in a lot of studs around them you know we've been out my my barber a lifelong Vermont or huge Memphis Grizzlies fan got my haircut two days ago we spent 15 minutes on Vince Williams I'm sure the rest of the Vermont shop had absolutely no idea what we were talking about  oh man yeah you know you've been doing the show for too long I'm like you know I'm not really too upper east guy I'm actually more of a Moses Brown guy  maybe come off the bench he's questionable though so you never know it's true um Shannon we also have the Pistons going up there at home going up against Cleveland's 9 point favorites but down with Mitchell is questionable so that could open up some stuff he's a Stewart's been back for Detroit talked about a little bit at the beginning of the show is there anything you like from this game  now as far as our tops and is a little bit interesting I you know in truth I don't like the magic for the Piston's so I'm probably gonna stay away from it as far as that 5500 on DraftKings he's played 36 and 35 minutes and back-to-back games which is certainly intriguing he's played three games against Cleveland this year averaging only 17 minutes per but also 17 and a half fantasy points so he's been a point per minute in those Cleveland games given his role now his newly expanded role since the trade deadline you'd have to expect that he sees more minutes tonight so he he's pretty solid there Cade my boy Kade has been tearing up averaging close to 50 fantasy points over the past four you know he does average in three contests against Cleveland this year 44.1 fantasy points and  I believe he's only 7900 on DraftKings I do feel like that's pretty low for him you know it's specialty he had a rough stretch right around the All-Star break just before and just after we had quite a few 30-point Fantasy games but he's top 50 in two of the past four top 40 and all four of those so I feel like you're getting at least a few hundred dollar discount with kids so 7,900 he is not option for tonight gentlemen we're not going to question so I'm gonna throw us a suggestion for you to think about Wizards Clippers is at 239 over under Wizards coming off played last night and went over time  also just absolutely terrible  also you got Paul George maybe probably not playing for the Clippers is this the Knight to pay for Hardin or Kauai  I mean I just think you worry about the game getting out of hand and then Kawaii Hardin playing like 29 minutes I think that's always the worry with these with these games that are like blow out fear yeah I mean I I say this for games that are 10 points Brad's 16 points spread um so yeah I mean I think look I actually I mean I'd be surprised if Paul George and zubac played in this game they're both questionable what's the point right so you may actually be able to find Value in this game you know with some guys off the bench potentially like maybe this is I want to go as far as to say like you should play a mere coffee necessarily but like you know Daniel theis breakout we've been right here  you just keep an eye on that game yeah  but no I mean I could see people avoiding that game for that reason so there's I think it was gpp stuff you know to talk about there but it's awesome it's the it is the latest Game of the night it is not part of DraftKings main slate for tonight the latest game for the main slate is the Sacramento Minnesota game also it is worth noting DraftKings NBA Tonight is a non-latex  that the Clippers game was part of it because of the blow up potential I would probably avoid both sides of it without late slot being available because I do I would be surprised if zubac or Paul George play but it's good question I mean I feel very similar about Clippers Washington as they do about  yeah some of these other lopsided games that we have on the Slate yeah is how close is the Milwaukee Chicago game going to be where the heck are they playing why is that a 10 p.m. Eastern game alecs  I actually don't know it's possible it's National TV it is on ESPN yeah okay we're very weird yeah Eastern out of Chicago is a weird thing that you see very rarely but there you know the Philly Charlotte game for instance another one that could be very lopsided you know if that the that is the early game so it doesn't apply but it's just something to keep in mind with not late swap you know some of your decisions are going to have to be different  I will say you know you mentioned Charlotte Philly could be lopsided it could also not be lopsided because the 76ers have been terrible lately like really bad um almost like it's in their best player it was almost like they're missing their best player but they so since January 25th they have  five four wins four wins since January 25th  so yes they are a 11/2 point favorite over the Hornets who played last night and lost him a walkie but oh could be a little closer I think Than People expect um let's see we only I mean this point we have two games we didn't talk about so let's let's just quickly hit those and then get out of here Golden State at Toronto as a 237 and a half over under my goodness Golden State's been cooking on offense they just played last night in MSG now going to Toronto we have Andrew Wiggins who's technically questionable for tonight's game but seems more than like lie that he will not play  yeah I mean anything from this game or the indie game which shockingly I will say no nobody had the injury report for the Pelicans like what am I I'm going am I going crazy oh so have nice Smith questionable for this game so from these two games anything that you see it doesn't Dice and Daniel's counts injury for Pelicans  he does but you know McCallum Ingram and Zion have been questionable for like two weeks yeah for what I'll do the the Golden State game first don't say Toronto you've got a couple interesting values the airpods is still starting pajam ski it still started at the shooting guard spot for Golden State with Wiggins out Moses Moody has made back-to-back spot starts he's played 23 and 26 minutes in those two games Chris Paul also joined the rotation rejoined the rotation around the same time so so Moody's not getting a you know a full compliment of around 30 minutes but he he's good for about 25 minutes and maybe 20 fantasy points he's 4,000 dollars on DraftKings for tonight come mingi is he's picked up a little bit pick up his production a little bit with Wiggins out he's coming off a nice 25 8 2 2 and 2 game so he's an interesting option as well for Toronto I'm gonna go off the board we're not gonna highlight someone and they're starting lineup you guys know those names but what about gradey Dick almost my long shot and suggestion of the week gradey dick sense the All-Star break or something trade deadline actually has been a regular in Toronto's rotation routinely playing around 20 minutes chucking up a bunch of Threes he had he had a 31 Point fantasy outing 31 fantasy points against Indiana on the 26th of February in 23 minutes he routinely reaching double figures and has a couple 30 point fantasy audience actually gradey dick 3700 could be a sneaky low ownership option from the Toronto side  yes he could be um let's see oh it's been a while it's been a while okay weeks to really fire up what's the old man rant today are  we really need three tribute statues for Kobe Bryant three Michael Jordan the greatest of all time and owner of six championships has one Statue Bill Russell owner of 13 championships and the first black coach in NBA history has won statue but Kobe needs three this is classic overly dramatic Los Angeles what's next a Nick Van Exel blimp maybe a giant transformer robot  that said I did enjoy this quote from his wife Vanessa Bryant at the unveiling of the first statue Vanessa said quote  Kobe picked the pose you're about to see so if anyone has issues with it tough shit  so I support Nick the quick statues everywhere and anywhere in America and Axle blimp you're not really set you're kind of doing the opposite of like making your point there like what we need a nickname axle blippi yeah probably should ignore that  okay mispronounced names I think we have I think we avoid it I think you may have slipped and called Andrew Wiggins Alan Wiggins Allen it's good beginning but that's that's bound to happen Okay thank you everybody for joining us the roadway fantasy basketball
