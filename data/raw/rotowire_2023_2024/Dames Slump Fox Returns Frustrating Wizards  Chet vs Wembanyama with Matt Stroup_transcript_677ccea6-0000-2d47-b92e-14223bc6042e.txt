welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog Vivid Seats and rival fantasy  it's Tuesday November 14th I'm Dr A  he  is my former podcasting partner in crime in another world and another another time far far away that's Matt Stroud let's go Matt are you impressed with my production skills  I I cannot believe that you successfully orchestrated that I know my mind is blown my mind  incredible  I'm proud of you go this is like a weird like did you ever see the Seinfeld where it was like sudo Sudo characters like Jerry Bizarro world he was bizarre world Seinfeld yeah and this is like Bizarro World round balls too like I'm hosting and you're you're the guests are you the guy you're the you're not the straight man like it's gonna be weird I I have a feeling the chemistry would be a lot better if it were reversed but you never know we're gonna find out right now who knows we might revert I mean like I might just take over and start hosting at some point it could happen I mean if you feel like it's going off the rails and you need to do something to save it man by all means by all means top right I mean on it I'll watch it closely for those of you who don't know who Matt is we work together at NBC for a long time we had a long time podcast  I've feel like we were just getting into the point where was about ready to explode you know I mean we were on Joe Rogan's heels there for a minute it was closed and then the whole thing out the whole thing up blown up so yeah then whatever is so what do you been up to Matt what do you what do you doing since last oh man I've been working on a couple different sports podcasts doing a little bit of sports TV writing I did some writing TV writing for the Women's World Cup over the summer still working on some sports podcast playing a lot of pickup basketball Steve and battling the leaves and acorns that are attempting to take over where I live that's kind of the the big three for me okay okay I have like a big seven um thanks for asking by the way yeah how are things you can't read this but it's on to this glass it's says closest to the pin winner that I wanted at a charity Golf Tournament of 130 golfers Matt I still threw a dart  and last year I won also one closest to him last year and last year I got a dozen brand new golf balls this year I got a I got a cup  a nice TV glass a little iced tea in there for anyone who's only listening some iced tea it is Ice-T it is only I see it's 11 a.m.  but Matt I work at a golf course I drive Delano Wine Tours I drive a van full of drunk ladies from Atlanta around I I didn't your wife come up here and do that at some point she did she might have been a drunk lady on your wine to her for all I know I told her to call you I'm surprised that she didn't but I'm thinking I'm going to maybe one of these days roll up in the Bobby Valentine remember when Bobby Valentine got tossed from the game and put on the discount I gotta walk into your van with the with the mustache costume on and just see if you notice that it's me playing a different character so and you know what else is weird about Bobby Valentine is is that who you said yeah and Bobby V's in Stamford Connecticut like that was our old stomping grounds together oh Bobby Valentine's Place map super sight before you know here's what we're gonna do today we're gonna talk news won't be all this Jewish shout away we're gonna talk news we're going to talk Panic meter guys that you and I are a little panicked about we're going to talk some hot players since I'm old as dirt we might do a get off my lawn  and then I've got a huge bet segment set of for a Day based on the fact that I realized at 5:00 this morning  that Victor woman and Chet Holmgren are going head-to-head tonight the Spurs and thunder on TNT Matt how excited are you about that I'm very excited I'm very excited I I think it's awesome that both of these guys are you know living up to the billing for the most part right and you you know in terms of fantasy or talking about two of the top five guys in Block shots so these both of these guys are are very exciting it's gonna be really fun to watch them go at it I will be dialed in Steve Matt I haven't because you're betting segment  I haven't looked at I think a lot of people are going to be dialing into that game tonight I think people are gonna DVR that game and I doubt it's because of my belly in segments but it Matt speaking of windy I drafted him and 30 deep I got him with 25th pick okay Built My Team around wimby  I added deer and fox I had it Austin Reeves I added guys I'm really excited about Kobe white has been like I have not been this excited about my 30 team rosters in a long long time I have Kim Thomas too but I haven't been able to run the whole Squad out there together because cam is her and fox missed five games we still haven't seen Peak Dr a 30 but I how are you how are you feeling about your team let me tell you how I'm feeling about my team Steve I am not in that League this year I retire that is that's what happens when you and I don't talk several times a week anymore and when you're in a 30 team fantasy league you actually don't notice who's in it you usually I don't even know who's on my team but that one I do know who's on my team let alone the owners the managers in the league I mean yeah or I can maybe name five of them right now  I think I'd been in that League going back to 2008 and I decided it was time to to not do it  you know it's it's  it was time Steve that's the way that disappointing if we're still if we're doing it for money I would still be in it the fact that it's a free 30 Team league with no Buy in I can't do it well since I don't have any money the only leaves I like to play in are the ones that don't cost any money together all right all right let's hit some news Damian Lillard  joined us last night played after missing a couple games with a calf  I think if you looked up the definition of the word Rusty in the dictionary right now Damian Lillard's picture on a milk carton might be there he was three of 17 one of nine 12.5 assists somehow  I still be my friend Richard in FanDuel with Damian Lillard on my squad thank you past Kelsey Occam  Steve let me ask you this I know this is not the Panic meter segments and I wouldn't I wouldn't say I'm panicked about Lillard but are we worried that all yet I mean I don't want to overreact to this last game but he's shooting 37% this year I mean I think ultimately it's Lillard and he's going to come around but if you drafted him in the first round you have to be a little bit concerned right there's there's got to be a little concerned Brewing well for the first of all for those of you scoring at home that was the moment Matt strap just took control of the show  and Instinct and nature took over it happened at 11:09 it took nine minutes he's like this kid is not gonna talk about basketball I need to redirect him and get him on track so the first of all that was smooth and very I actually really did that no I am a little worried about Damon Lillard I'm not gonna lie I'm actually more worried about the Bucks because you give away Drew holiday right you lose your house you didn't really get away but you lose your holiday yeah um he was your defense of Foundation along with Giannis replaced him with Damian Lillard who doesn't play defense now Lillard is not the man he's playing with the man then he gets hurt he hasn't looked that he's looked great in like one game right he took over one game and it's like ooh maybe this is James team no it's not and he hasn't looked all that great and now they lost Jae Crowder who's another Like Glue guy defensive kind of enforcer Off the Bench I'm I don't think the books  are as good as people think they are Matt and and I'm a little worried about Dane Lillard and famous yes yeah I mean I'm not worried to the extent of what he's been around the top 60 or something like that so far just on a per game basis in a nine category League I'm not where I think he's gonna jump up from that I don't think he's obviously gonna shoot in the 30s we know who this guy is I just think maybe you're starting to get worried is he not gonna hit first round value you know I think it's a fair question to ask yeah it is fair and I mean we're not James Harden worried no no no I'm not gonna get an email from a guy or a tweet from a guy saying hey I trade James Harden for for Cade Cunningham like I got last night I was like yeah you might as well do it dude I don't I don't want James Harden on my team great question great question Matt here in Fox returns from a five game absence the hero of my 318 is he go off with 28.6 assists two triples its 11:20 shots he did not look Rusty he  looked exactly like he looked before he got hurt  but his teammates all went crazy so bonus Keegan Murray Kevin herder all scored at least 20 that's four of five starters scoring 20 points and then the league month looks solid Off the Bench as usual herders been kind of a monster for the last two games old red velvet I'm sure that is the crawl on your in your side welcome back to your inbox  yeah for sure I mean he looks great has looked great the only only small gripe pad with foxes you wish he wouldn't quite miss the the volume of free throws he misses right he's at 75% in a limited amount this year on seven attempts for game that's a little annoying but you'll live with it the rest of the production is really good yeah in my world 75% is our goal for free throws and since I'm a Luca Luca guy like 75 is the gold standard right yeah so um speaking of know Jay Crowder in Milwaukee Jake Crowder had growing surgery he's gonna be out a while like a long time Bobby Portis  two months I think yeah Bobby Portis  came off the bench and 19 points 10 boards  a block it's 7:10 shots 25 minutes  Chris Middleton is still  well we may talk about him later but Chris Middleton's out there wandering around the court for 19 minutes a game on one leg another reason I worry about the box but is Bobby Porter is suddenly a guy that you need to find a way to get on your team I I think so I'm generally encouraged he's been solid like the it's not quite as exciting as last year the numbers are down but yeah maybe it's not a one-for-one with Crowder but Crowder was playing a lot of minutes so maybe this opens up a bit more opportunity for Port us where you can get a bit closer to what he did last year which was you know more like 14 and 10 per game where he's been around 12.6 boards this year so I do think maybe Monday night was a start and we start to see a bit more of the Portis we saw last year hopefully  yes I agree  Matt where do you stand in the bill all coola Bali Camp the Washington Wizards yeah youngsters who filled it up last night  I I'm extremely intrigued I will say that I was looking at his game log and I certainly don't have him on rosters but I'm feeling a little bit sad that I don't we're talking about seven Steals and a block over the last two games five threes seven rebounds and three assists in each of those games  yeah I mean when you think about what's going on with the Wizards a guy like this should only continue to get more opportunity to think I talked about Miss free throws he was one for four from the line combines his last couple games but other than that this is a highly intriguing guy who is 28% roster in Yahoo leaks 28% and 20 that if he's 28 in Yahoo he's probably like  12 in ESPN yeah and that 28 number is up 24% in the last week so well added right and left belong to lie played 33 minutes for Washington he bounces in and out of the starting lineup didn't have these just kind of playing playing well so cool about is  he comes off the bench but he played 33 minutes off the bench last on the 10.7 boards three assists three steals a block and a three-pointer and he's kind of he's kind of a steals machine in the preseason people were getting kind of excited about him he got off to a quiet start with the regular season but man he he's coming on if nothing else  you all should at least go look up kulae today and and check them out one point one steals point eight blocks 1.43 is in his limited playing time this season I mean it's only November but if you want to think ahead to later in the season when the Wizards are season is you know even more off the rails just imagine cool about his opportunity and some of the box scores he could be putting up this is a guy you want you could potentially play now but this is a guy also want stash for down the stretch yes and on a side note Kyle kuzmin was great last night with 34 points and four triples for those Washington Wizards  Matt I made assures that with our friend Noah Rubin  I had my choice of anyone in the league who I thought might lead the league in scoring that might help me win a jersey okay and I took Jordan Poole  wait you could take any what like you could take Luca  yeah  yeah well this is shocking this I am shocked by I'm shocked by this it is shocking it's embarrassing man it's I'm I've not been able to sleep ever since that happened so yeah I'm I'm alarmed  all right  Pascal siakam had like almost 70 to a points last night yeah no me did not play anything to do that started in his place it was Otto Porter I believe Otto Porter  started from Pascal siakam but it was I mean started for OG in and Obey but it was siakam who went crazy with 39 points 11 boards seven assists three steals a Dennis Schroder was imitating Dame Lillard last night and hit one of 12 shots for the Raptors that was hugely disappointing but it's hard to be mad at Schroeder he's been awesome this year siakam obviously is a different player I think if ogna Nobis not out there stealing half his Thunder every night  yes Yoakam 30 230 point games this season and they're they've come in his last three games that's for sure I mean yeah he has gotten off to a great start I do find myself wondering he's been such a frustrating fantasy guy in recent years where he kind of hovers around that top 150 Mark you're asking yourself is this guy actually helping or hurting my fantasy team what are you better off if he's on the waiver wire he's like Alright he's in right on that line this year he's been better than that but I guess I'm looking for any sort of  signs that it might be unraveling that one for 12 not going to overreact to that but I certainly  wouldn't be surprised to see Schroeder kind of  descend a bit after his incredible start because it's been it's been a little bit better than he's been in recent years man I think the term the saying the phrase that you're looking for is you're waiting for the other shoe to drop  yes that would work that would work yes I took a longer route there but yeah yes similar idea you're taking Schroeder with a grain of salt  early Schroeder with a grain of salt yeah  I'm worried about schroders  history of Schroeder had some competition in Toronto but I still feel like he does like I don't know who else would play point guard there yeah so and I think shooters shooters good to go and note to self if ogn and Obi ever misses another game you better have  Pascal semen in your lineup  you know Underdog fantasy is the number one platform for

 my five dollars to win $500 Harley that I threw together I threw this together on underdog.com today this morning at 5 a.m.  5.00 to 500 at 5 a.m. I couldn't believe in a tree I was so excited about the show I couldn't sleep I had notes I had to make I'm adding to our Google doc on my phone and my bed my wife's like the hell dude it's 5 a.m. what is wrong with you I might calm down I have a I have a huge show today  you show um  so here it is and then you and I have talked about this like when you when you set one of these little five Banger Harley deals on underdog  you feel like when you look at it like well how could how could this guy not hit two three-pointers yeah how yeah it's a done deal how can how can it how can below coulibaly not get one steal tonight right yeah yeah but it's a little harder than you think they have all five guys do what they're supposed to do every night and you know some called probability Steve a little math lesson there well specially when you're clicking on the the guys that have the little pepper next their name and it's like yeah those are the ones that are the jacked up odds when that's when you get 500 dollars for spending five right if you're talking about some gambles  but man you look at it on on paper and it's like so how does this how does this not happen here it is man okay three three guys that need to double double tonight that's all we got to do  10 points 10 boards 10 points 10 assists whatever okay Luke  all right walking on walking Double-Double done  beef stew Isaiah Stewart did Detroit Pistons big man 1711 last game had a 1711 earlier Jalen Duren is not walking through those doors tonight  I don't think that your guy who's to do they got drafted by the kings in front of Luca  backley Marvin Bagley bagley's probably gonna start but I don't think he's gonna I I just need some beef stew Love Tonight I'm worried about that one Chet Holmgren  National TV going against whim Beach chip on his shoulder everybody talks about Wimpy nobody talks about me watch this  how does he not double double so if I need those three guys just to Simply get a double-double  I need a man named Shae Gill just Alexander to hit two three-pointers  okay  not outrageous 48 minutes of basketball two threes know I'll give you that one I need his teammate Jalen Williams to score 18 points Matt if all those things happen  I'm taking you to a winery  in my van  Jamie here off a 30-point game Steve I think I'm most worried about your chat Double-Double I got okay all right three of them three of them this season for for chat so he certainly can't do it three in I believe 10 games so  that's the one that I think maybe maybe makes this whole thing happened that that's the one that has to fall for you oh so I can see chip getting a double-double in the first half in the none of these other guys hitting theirs so yeah I mean you could easily go for five on this I hope not and I need that I need that I need the big win I needed to happen all right let's move on let's move on to the Panic meter  yes please  let's move on the pain of me and unless you have it do you have 100 dog tail or do you have a bet for this evening that you  got your eye I don't have a five I don't have a five five Banger I had a couple I was looking at you know I was actually looking at the chat I'll keep it with chat I was looking at 17.5 points and assists over on that that he's he's gone over that in four out of his last six games so I'm just gonna throw that at you as a as an option okay that's research right there that's research so what I have points and assists over chat that's that's my chat that's my chat bet  well yeah  the other thing I could do is when we're done here I could just obsess about those five players for the rest of the day and just keep building different Harleys and just keep picking different categories and I like that and just go five dollars a pop and I hit like  300 dollars I like that and then one of them has to hit right one of them one of them has to that's math ah all right  um if you are enjoying this video and enjoy this podcast hit the like And subscribe buttons because they tell me that  really really helps and I believe them and I don't know who they is  but also maths wrong told  this like it's like a math class  Matt before we get into the Panic meter I'm gonna take a quick look at the comments and see if there's a question here that we should look at this right here  oh Brenda Jones it's great to see us together again  and it's fantastic uh good morning guys you think it's safe to drop scoot Henderson I already have amphi Simons and Walker Kessler Nina I also spot man I'm gonna say  I'm gonna go ahead and say yeah  I I am okay with it if you have to we're talking about a guy who was looking like a potential lot major liability in two categories before the injury right low fuel goal percentage around 35% four turnovers per game that's hard to overcome and fantasy league when we talk about guys who sink you in two of those categories percentages and turnovers it's tough and he's a rookie I mean yeah there could be some great games in the future but I'm okay with it if you have to mostly don't even know when we're gonna see him again yeah  here's some guys that I'm a little worried about Devin Booker and I'm just gonna rattle these off  um yeah I don't have to spend a lot of time on it but Devin Booker's missed five straight games  that's a little concerning to me this whole Bradley Beal is playing again that's gonna be interesting to see that Dynamic when they get back I'm just I just thought Bookers was gonna be back I think he had is ankle was her and then it turned in some calf I have some breaking news for you Steve  I'm being told that Booker is returning Wednesday  breaking news as of 11:11 a.m. thank you I just saw that  thank you so just told us that as well so DeAndre Hunter  has scored four eight 12 and 10 points as last four games before that he was kind of balling out for the Hawks  they've got this three-headed monster with steep Bay and Jalen Johnson you are you I would consider you one of the top five DeAndre Hunter  experts in the country oh thank you yes so I would like to know what your take is on the under  well I'll be honest it's been a complete roller coaster because at the start of the season I was thinking to myself man this is the guy that we saw a couple years ago who was was actually putting it all together for the host and this is a guy they had to have on the floor and he was looking like that version of DeAndre Hunter you know you talk about the first five games he had a 27 point game in there he had a 23 point game in there but yeah the last four have been rough I think Miami in their win over the Hawks was pretty happy anytime DeAndre Hunter dribbled I mean like he was just he was turning it over and  I don't know man I the Hawks I think are better does less I got to be honest I think the Hawks are better plays defense and when he catches and shoots so I I don't know that high usage Hunter is going to be the blueprint for the most part and I think he's kind of a fringe guy in fantasy I mean he does have a steal and a block in each of his last two games I have seen him contesting shots a bit more aggressively he had a pretty nasty Block in the last game actually and that's kind of a weak spot for him is the defensive stats so I think I'm hanging on to him if I picked him up but I am tempering my expectations a bit and I think he's probably gonna be a lower end Fringe guy as if to like oh here he comes he's like a mid round player  if he I think he's gonna revert to play and like he was for the first 10 days of season at some point Bobby Ramen is with me on that like I don't think I don't think DeAndre Hunter is automatic throw away I just don't I don't have I think I dropped him where I had him and I picked up hot free agency played more games and I think that's sort of where we're at with the hunter he's probably gonna give me one of those guys that bounces on and off of Waiver Wires all year but there are times yeah four game week I wouldn't mind throwing DeAndre Hunter out there yeah we've really seen both sides of the argument honestly through this first stretch of the season  yeah who were some guys on your Panic meter I also have Markle fultz on there yeah he tendonitis and I think I think you've got a guy  coming up later that maybe go ahead yeah well no I I with you on Markel faults I dropped him in a shallow League recently and I really haven't looked back I think there's a chance that he figures it out as well but you're talking about a point guard who doesn't really hit threes and you know his County stats were good last year but not anything you're going to regret dramatically I think if he gets it going and it is crowded with Jalen Suggs playing well I think a guy we're going to talk about later so I agree with the unfolds  I mean I think we have to talk about James Harden for a second 13.5 points per game we haven't seen him averaging in the teens in scoring since the early 2010s I know it's only four games you expect him to be better than this but he's 34 years old and Steve Dives are are so so bad so make you so nervous with the Clippers right now  yeah  if if he is the system I don't I don't like that that system I don't I don't want to be in that system if he is the system I mean everybody knew going in that this is going to be a science experiment and there's a lot of  flammable chemicals involved and you know something bad could happen at any any given second with this yeah I mean I I had 0 interest in Touching Harden this year and I'm glad I didn't  write and I will say if you ended up with him I don't think now is the time to trade him away I do think you whether this try to whether this for a couple more weeks as he gets ramped up see if the scoring average gets closer to I don't know 18 points per game something like that he's gonna be a lot more potentially a lot more tradable a couple weeks from now whereas  I can't imagine getting really worse than this honestly  I guess it could but I can't imagine his number is really getting worse well you know James Harden right I mean  dude yeah this I would be the beginning  I don't know I yeah I guess I dare on the side of trying to be patient though the one other one I wanted to mention I had several but  is it darker Kessler oh that's Jones I was like a shot I took a shot and I missed you were right I was about to talk about Ty Jones and I switched for some reason so the question is is Ty Jones a drop the Wizards clearly don't want to win but at what point does the front office let them try Steve I probably should have let you read that but I read it no no ties Jones averaging 9.5 assists this is not what I think any of us signed up for given the opportunity we know that he's been really good when he's gotten a chance to start for the Grizzlies  I'm gonna hang on to Monday's game 10 points 8 assists two threes and call that a step in the right direction I am not going to drop ties Jones if I can avoid it  I think better days are ahead Steve  the two t Jones's really been disappointing thus far hmm Trey and ties they're both point guards they're both  maligned I get questions about dropping both of them way more than I wish I would I thought when I was drafted them late my drafts I was getting good quality good quality guys for my team but I don't know that I was all right man let's move on to Walker Kessler we've talked about  fittingly in the middle of the panic meter segment I bumped into my microphone and nearly knocked it over so I feel like that was a propriate moment yeah Walker Kessler got off that slow start now he's injured I I think this is actually a probably a Bi-Lo situation for me but I understand the panic I just think even with the terrible start I mean he's still getting a lot of blocks he had a couple monster games in there mixed in with the frustrating ones I just think eventually Utah's not that good this guy's gonna get his opportunity and with him injured would be I think a great opportunity to try to trade for a guy who's a real Difference Maker in blocks  you know that Jersey bet that no one I made also involved he took Walker Kessler for blocks I took Victor women Yama okay pretty good about that one right now yeah tell us about Cade Cunningham because I find your information here to be shocking simply shocking  do you I am not really I I think that I just think Panic is maybe not the appropriate word for Katie Cunningham but I will say I think there's a chance that this guy is pulling down your roster in like a nine category League more than you realize because you're talking about a rough field goal percentage on very high volume High turnovers doesn't really get defensive stats so I think it's easy to look at you know the points he assists the threes and say oh yeah this is this is going well and not realized that he's kind of sinking you in a couple of categories and while not helping you you know not getting you steals that you'd want out of that position so to me he's not a guy who was drafting for some of these reasons I think maybe you  could  put him into a trade given his name recognition and the high scoring and all that and you know you might be able to get a guy who's not going to drag your team down in a couple of those categories  the NBA season is here on behalf of our friends at Vivid Seats

they're all over the place we're watching the second half of the Falcons game  I'm sure you're excited to talk to me about the Falcons today so I have no idea what's going on all I know is I've got four of my five like parlay has hit  and I've got Danny Gafford with five rebounds at halftime  he only needs two rebounds the entire second half and I win a bazillion dollars right  thank you played a minute in the second half I don't think he did he didn't have any rebounds he finished with fire rebounds I don't know if you got cool about it I don't know if he got ejected I I was too wrapped up in what Arty Smith was  doing  blowing up on the television in the front me I never was able to find out but  why why does Vegas hate me Matt that's why I brought you on the show today can you explain to me in the people why does Vegas hate me that's that's painful but that I feel like that's a little bit of the the Daniel Gafford experience right you kind of got a  counting on that guy for one game Steve so risky you've kind of got just throwing I don't swallow man I don't know what it down this is helpful information to you now but I don't know that I want gaffer in a five like parlay I want it in my fantasy lineup for you know a week or two and just let that play out its volatile Steve it's minutes are all over the place he turned around 2026 26 9 boards so I had I just I just don't understand no I know I and that's that's a special tilting while the Falcons are predictably melting down to have that happen makes it a tough Sunday for you how is it that anyone is still a die-hard Falcons fan Matt can you can you explain that to me  I I I've had to emotionally distance myself a little bit I still watched the game but I fully expect the the heartbreaking loss to happen I was talking to not to derail here but I make this quick I was talking to a Bears fan who lives near me the other day and he was like oh you just have the the Cardinals that should be at pretty easy win for you I was like no no no no this is this game is going to be incredibly sweaty and I will not be surprised when the Falcons lose it and that's what happened because that's that's Arthur Smith ball in the year 2023 that's just what we're doing yeah oh and then last night I needed a double-double from Jared Allen  uh-huh 12 points nine boards yeah the whole fourth quarter you get it rebound  just didn't  okay hot players man  hot players who you got  hot players  who do I have oh you know what this is a name that we talked a bit about earlier it's Jalen Suggs we only mentioned in passing a connection to Markle faults but Steve I just feel like this guy's been one of the revelations of the early part of this NBA season and the fantasy season averaging 2.1 steals 0.6 blocks his percentages were bad early in his career but his free throw percentage is up over 80 I just think this former top five pick looks like he's finally putting it together he's a guy who if you've watched a magic game just plays this incredibly tenacious defense he's super aggressive going for steals fun player to watch and I think he's I think he's here to stay in this magic rotation and in our fantasy lineups  yeah and Cole Anthony is combining with you and Subs to to make this Markell full thing tough it is a three-headed monster point guard so yeah Jill Suggs has been good I like him in DFS a little more than I liked him in  straight up fantasy but yeah he's been he's been good Matt here's one that's relatively what we were talking about from Brian B so I dropped Killian Hayes and pick up the law cooler ballet 10 teams Nine Cats  would you do it that's a closed that's a close one I think for me I'm probably going to play for cool the unknown of cooler Bali over the sort of relatively known of killing Hazel though killing Hayes has been solid I think it depends on how willing you are to  take a short-term loss for a long term gains does that make sense like I think there's certainly a chance you dropped killing Hayes and he has a better game his next game out then cool about it does but long term I think coolies to play I want to make well and cooling ballet the bottom line is is Rick Cameron like say is famously gold he's yeah he's steals blocks and threes are are just so valuable if he does that long term and the way the way the Wizards are headed  like I why would they not play this guy at 1,000 minutes a night he's fun to watch too so yeah talk to me about Dice and Daniel's map yeah this is just a guy who I I picked up recently I mean we know that the Pelicans have a bunch of injuries right herb Jones has been out CJ mccollum's out I think there was some hope that oh maybe Jordan Hawkins is going to take off and he did have that 31 point game but he's been a little erratic shooting the ball so I turned to Dyson Daniels he's coming off a 17.9 rebound for assist stat line three three pointers in that game I think he had a 10-point 10 rebound double double before that Steve speaking of double doubles we also know this is a guy who can pile up a bunch of steals he didn't have one last game out but  16% rostered I think in Yahoo league is at last check this is a guy that I'm I'm going to pick up in the short term and see where this goes yeah I'm still hanging out in the Jordan Hawkins Camp okay since I picked them up everywhere and need him to play well I'm still still hanging in there with him he's starting he's getting 30 minutes but I think it's kind of a coin toss right now between these two guys and yeah they're both worth consideration I don't mind the Jordan Hawkins thing I think at this point you've taken after that 31 point game you've taken a four for 11 a 4 for 11 and a three for 13 I think you almost have to roll with them again here on Tuesday night and just and just see if he explodes because I mean it sounds like you so I mean he's due and it has to have and this is math I'm putting him in an underdog line up right when we're done man look at this question Brian B again Brian Brian B's blowing a Subway he's got good stuff someone just dropped Walker Kessler my other league 14 teams  wow just that's not run don't walk right yeah that's a run situation get out leave right now and just go pick him up and then come back we'll probably don't leave stay for the end of the podcast and then go to it or try it this is all on it's all stored like I was gonna say it's all on tape they don't say tape anymore right well yeah we're not taping yet it's yeah I don't time to explain to you but yeah there's no tapes involved here can you explain it to me maybe off there when we're done off are yes we'll conference oh one of my hot guys Skylar Mays yeah kid running the point in Portland two straight double-doubles  Anthony Simons done for a while Damian Lillard I don't know if you heard this doesn't play for Portland anymore scoot Henderson we haven't seen him for a long time he did not look good when we did see him Skylander maze to me she should be roster and every League there is Matt  yeah I think I haven't seen whether they converted his contract from a two-way I believe he's on a two-way contract with the Blazers but you have to imagine  that's gonna happen the way he's playing 15 points 12 assists 18 points 11 assists last two games even just saying I think I saw on Underdog his high or lower on a sis is 8 and a half so I'm just putting out in your putting that into your orbit I bet a double double has a fat chili pepper but two 2.5 Max yeah how many hockey's  oh nice yes  no you said it so talking about this dude man please for the place for the the heat right yep yep um Tyler here goes down  yeah nobody's talking about  how many hocus suddenly he's blowing up every night every category yeah I I added him recently he's only 18% roster and Yahoo  it if you're just just objectively if you're not a Heat fan it's super annoying that they got this guy because he's such a polished college player who like just kind of a plug and play ready-made NBA rotation player so yeah I think this is they did have Butler miss a game but I think this is directly tied to Tyler here oh we know is out for a number of weeks so I'm on board with a 38 32 minutes his last two games he's been feeling up to stat sheets so yeah you can count me in on this one  well yeah and Butler was out for I think his really big game but he's averaging 10 points for boards to assist two steals a triple over his last six games he scored between 11:20 and 3 straight he's playing big minutes for the Heat and it's pretty fun we're gonna blow through these I'd like to we need to get out of here yeah relatively so don't skip counted George yeah don't I'm not going to he gorge in Utah matter of time before you start going off well would you like to say about that no I I completely agree I I think that you know it's it seems like he's taking over from Talen Horton Tucker as a starting point guard he's only scored seven points in each of his last two games but he has nine and 11 assists and he is an aggressive scorer I think you know he was two for 12 last game I think there's a chance that comes around so yeah  and Utah's had a bunch of three game weeks like as soon as keonte has a four game week I think that's what I'm gonna that's gonna swoop in make money yeah  I mean look I don't I have been talking about my concern about field goal percentage with some other players so that is something I'm watching closely with George but I certainly think giving the opportunity he at least needs to be stashed on your bench  um Reggie Jackson  you're probably not fired up about this one but Jamal Murray's gone till December  like Cliff Jean Reggie has four games this week has four games next week  no one else is playing point guard for Denver except Reggie Jackson I don't think he's going to get a ton of fantasy gold but I think he's gonna put up solid numbers in back to back for game weeks which is all you can really ask for from a waiver wire pickup I accept it I'm fine with it this man about it I don't feel bad about it bismack biyombo gets picked up off the waiver wire the literal waiver wire by the Memphis Grizzlies comes in immediately goes for 9 and 10 in a block every night he's been pretty sweet  and then with no one The Carter Junior in Orlando Goga and mo Vagner go to Batavia both putting up  intriguing stats serviceable and intriguing stat lines Matt he'll throw back yeah I'm on board that I must be on board with the biyombo saying I know you love the busy Beastie Steve and he's been quite good and and big opportunity there at Center for Memphis at the moment  LeBron versus Jordan magic vs bird Berkeley versus Michael basketball synonymous with

lacking chat  um the 17.5 points in this I already said that one not  that was the best one I dug up this morning well let's talk about your other one because this is a guy that I don't think I would throw a roll of nickels at if I had it  unless I was trying to knock him out and well wow wow okay aggressive aggressive aggressive well it's uh and do I feel great about this one no but in short it's Kyle Lowry over 15 and a half points and assists he is coming off a rest game they play Charlotte on Tuesday  I believe he's off the injury report based on the latest I saw obviously follow up on that but  he had 20 points in assists a couple games ago he had 21 points in assists the last game he's playing big minutes at the moment 33 335 33 the last three games Heroes out  I just think yeah I think that's a that's a number that Kyle Lowry can clear even if you don't love having him in  a parlay on your fantasy lineup  yeah I yeah yeah you're probably gonna go ahead and I'm gonna go ahead and disagree yes I don't feel great about that one but but I was close enough that I said hey let's let's give that one look well you were you were with me last year I think when I decided that I was done with Kyle Lowry  first sure I drafted Kyle Lowry about 17 consecutive years in my family's and then I kind of bailed last year but here he comes again you know here he comes Steve  isn't that a Dolly Parton song  well that's the agenda for our post call yeah okay let's do that though the one that I put together last night when I was playing in this whole show out and it I woke up in the middle of night and I was like oh my God Joe Ellen beat his questionable now like what is gonna happen he I can't get on here and do a do an underdog bet that has a guy that's not going to play in it so I panicked and I went to the those Luco five main or special for 500 dollars eighty five hundred dollars that's crazy dude this other one that I did is two dollars to win 25 dollars a little more reasonable possibly sure  so the Indiana Pacers I don't know if you pay attention to this map they're giving up like 150 points a game right I yeah I've been watching some of those games they just speaking getting trucks so Joelle and bead out there against them kind of just him and Tyrese Maxey  49.5 total points rebounds in assists seems very gettable to me for me Benedict 57 last game or something like that yeah he's probably averaging 50  a night I would guess total of those bennedict mathurin I've got him at over 14 points 14 and a half points  he kind of went on he's been going off kind of  he's been up and down that this could go either way better yeah Tyrese Howard and leading the league in assists you know he needs to get ten and a half tonight seems like he'll uh it's a little it's a little sketch right here with Bruce Brown needing two three-pointers but Matt Bruce Brown hits 63 pointers was that the first game of the season for the Pacers I'm not really sure but I'm I know Bruce Brown has yeah six triple game under his belt this season  you know I don't love this one even if it wins it's only 25 bucks but that would be that would be nice I'm not gonna turn 25 bucks down  no Bruce Brown is your big wild card here though he has one exactly one three pointer and four of his last five games it's math he's dude he's dude  man he's due for three pointers for brown put on the board well Matt this is  just like the old days yeah  if you haven't checked out the road or draft kit check it out you try Rotoworld for  good Lord the Lord he could try wrote a wire for free at rotowire.com try I'm guessing that's like the third maybe fourth time that I've made that slip and Matt you know from working with me historically I can't even get NBA players names correct yeah I mean I mixed up who was Boucher ahan Bosch and Bosch all the time so you throw me with two words that have a W for the second word and a roto in the first word I mean what are the chances I'm gonna get that right  307% maybe I don't know  yeah  listen I hear you hitting hitting one of these five five like parlays you getting that right hey dude if I hit if I hit for 500 you're coming up here we're playing golf and we're going wineries we're taking our ladies my kids will watch your kids and we're just we're just gonna have a Time  all right we might do that anyway well we should but I stopped asking  you're always like oh I can't I can't I can't make it a game at I didn't I never I never saw window where you were actually gonna get in your car and drive to Lana get to play golf well now I'm gonna do it so I just show up in that mask and I wonder if I wonder if Underdog could set that up for us and we can bet on it  Matt it's been great it's just like old times a
