we don't have any AD reach that that end with a thank you to to the AI Community but I'm here for it  I've been leaning more into AI recently I I use of the last couple of weeks I've been using chat GPT for so many odds and ends sort of things I probably shouldn't admit this but I'm almost positive my wife doesn't listen to an NBA fantasy podcast  our anniversary our seventh I mean maybe our seventh wedding anniversary was the other day I'm sitting there and we've all had this moment you sit there with the birthday card or an anniversary card and you just you're not having that spark of inspiration of what do I write I actually chat GPT it or you say nice things to say in an anniversary card and I didn't copy it but just gives you a couple of thoughts starters so if we can use this now for that we can use it to fill out brackets Like There's No Limits here so rather than being afraid of it Nick I am leaning right into it  okay even in my love life let's uh what do you say we talked about basketball right okay it's in the NBA last night we'll do some recapping their I got a big Wednesday slate coming at us you already submitted your your price picks for tonight so really excited about that we're going on week three now of Brandon handing out a couple prize picks want to push everybody to Road a while or.com slash picks really great Hub hugely popular area on our site where you can get insights on just about any type of prop you may want to throw down and you know price picks that's usually what we we recommend most you know you couldn't sleep or Underdog even helps you if you want to do traditional you know prop betting over at DraftKings or FanDuel or bad MGM or whatever so you've been using that tool Brandon where did you go last night how did it go and where are we looking forward tonight last night was sort of sort of a disaster the last two days of not being good I've hit two-day cold spell I usually at least go one and one I got a little hot at the end of last week and I have cooled right off I was on Donte divincenzo at the over and I mean the next played great but they just didn't need him to have an amazing game and then and then to and I stayed in that same game Tobias Harris for more than six and a half rebounds I think he finished with about three the 76ers couldn't do anything well so let's move on past that  let me also promote what I love using with when I because I go through my my props selection you know I've told you I kind of Ouija board it I let the I let the board come to me and then I'll go to Road a wire and see does my opinion aligned with what the projection I don't want to just blindly go into the projection tool but I use it as sort of like you know it it makes me feel more assured that I'm on the right track Austin Reeves more than 24 and a half pra points rebounds and assists tonight I went and looked at that at the projection tool not only does it tell you what he has hit on that Mark throughout the course of the Season it tells you what he's done in the last 10 games it tells you if he's hit that in the last the percentages of the last 20 games against that specific opponent you know how long this research would take me if I didn't have this projection tool it just does it for me so I'm able to spit this stuff out a lot faster 70% of the time he has gone over 24 and a half pra in the last 20 games I love that he said it in his last five and then the other one Hometown guy Jalen Suggs back in the lineup the magic needs some offense of juice one and a half threes is his projected total so we're going to take him for more than that so those are the two picks tonight I feel really good about it I think we're  getting back to our winning tonight yeah I like it I like it a lot of good data there a lot of good explanations I'm feeling confident you talk me into it and like two minutes and again go check out rotowire.com slash picks whatever site you play on whatever book whatever Pick'em site we got a ton of information there and have nothing else it's a research tool you know I don't recommend just you know blindly doing whatever the pics tool recommends you want to get your own input in there but you know on a night like tonight brain when you got nine games on the NBA slate you know I pull up price picks or I pull up the book and it's like man where where do I even begin and this is that's really what I use RotoWire picks for most is to just like all right this one at least give me a batch of players or a group of games you know that that seemed to kind of trigger some alarms you know as far as where the value may be and one of the things but sorry I just want to break in what was one of the things that I look for it and I and I don't follow this discipline to a tea every day because we're giving out these picks every single day and sometimes you end up getting caught up trying to latch on undo a streak or a guy is Luka doncic is a good example where he had he had six straight 30-point triple doubles so I took I took his over for his pra the other day at 54 and a half he had a 20-point triple double and he still didn't hit it so sometimes it can be it it's tough when you try and hop onto a moving train I'm back to the basics today and one of my more consistent disciplines is to hop on players or teams that need the bounce back the Lakers have not beaten the Sacramento Kings yet this season so you know they're going to be extra locked in the magic Heaven scored 100 points and back to back games they have no offense and so where are they going to get it from tonight so some of those sort of disciplines of not just trying to hop on the moving train but actually trying to catch the bounce back before it happens yeah Lakers need it Kings coming in on the second night of a back-to-back they have been terrible in these situations three and seven against the spread on the second night of back-to-backs this season yeah when I was gonna bring up before was Sacramento just whipping the Milwaukee Bucks last night and you know I I was on Damian Lillard you know with some player props and DFS last night yeah I thought he had really seemingly flipped the switch since the All-Star break he was averaging like four made threes per game 25 points he was coming off the back to back you know 2010 double-doubles be honestly played well and this was one of those games Brandon where it reminded me of the first 40 games of the year where it's like if you don't know who Damian Lillard is you're watching this game and he just look like just another guy two of 12 shooting you know is very very passive you know some of the shots were kind of forced end of the shot clock Situation's it didn't help that Milwaukee had an ultra cold shooting night overall Malik Beasley missed like seven wide open Corner threes  at one point Sacramento I think in the first half was plus 24 from Beyond The Arc in terms of points off of three-pointers so I  I you know I think you chalk this up to just kind of an off night for a few guys from Milwaukee obviously they still don't have Chris Middleton back but then you look at the bench scoring right and it's like you get absolutely nothing from Jake Crowder who started on the wing Bobby Portis you know 11 points of 21 minutes that's fine  pack audited two of nine AJ Green one of six Patrick Beverley one of four he got banged up in this game like I know getting khris Middleton back if he is Pete khris Middleton that's a huge if but if he's P khris Middleton that solves a lot of Milwaukee's problems I still feel like you know there's gonna be times in a playoff series you know not even you know not even talking like Easter final like this is something that could affect them early on where we look and say man they just feel like they're still a guy short  it should not ever happen where you have Giannis and Damian Lillard sharing a basketball court and you can't get to 100 points how does that even happen and not only did it happen last night you could go okay we'll chalk it up to just they just had a bad night that off night it was on that twice three  they've done it twice in the last four games or one in three in their last four and in two of those games they've scored 94 or less  I don't understand how you have this collection of talent there's still something even though they've put it together enough times for us to go okay you know they're they're Milwaukee they still have one of the best players in the world and they're still they have these games are these really these stretches throughout the season where they just they're chemistry isn't there and it's still feels like it hasn't geld properly Damian Lillard I mean I thought I thought the All-Star break was exactly what he needed and not just the break but the way that he performed and it reinserted some confidence Patrick Beverley telling him he's the man and all that good stuff  I just don't think he's the same guy anymore  and so they're really gonna have to cross their fingers and hope that he can put it together long enough to take this team deep through the Eastern Conference playoffs because they feel like one of those teams that will be the higher seed and everybody's going to want to take the underdog because we just don't trust Milwaukee  Lillard not being the same guy or being even a slightly diminished version of the guy he's been for his entire career is obviously a just after scenario for Milwaukee because this is not  this is not like LeBron and Wade trying to figure it out first year in Miami and you're like all right well you know it when the title in 2011 but they'll be back they'll figure this out and they did it's like if lizards not himself this year it's not gonna get better going forward right it's like he's not going to probably reverse that Trend as he goes closer into his mid-30s so that's very concerning for Milwaukee I you know I don't think we need to do any revisionism on the trade I still think it was something the Bucks had to do at that time and again I think you can't really overstate how big of a deal it is to be without Chris Middleton for seemingly half of the season and you know even the games he's played a lot of those who spent limited I know outside of Milwaukee maybe that doesn't feel like that big of a deal but the depth that they sacrificed to bring in Lillard it's like  you're planning on Chris Middleton being out there and I do think we see a different version of this team when he's back that could be within the next few days by the way he was initially listed as questionable for last night's game so I do think they get Middleton back in the mix soon enough and that probably changes things but you know does that push them over the top and you know is that is that the piece that makes you feel good about them you know winning a seven game series on the road at Boston for me probably not you know and even if you were to get to the NBA finals and it's it's Denver it's it's the Clippers it's whoever it's hard to feel confident in this team at the same time Brandon this whole this whole year has felt like a  train wreck is very strong but it you know it hasn't gone like we thought it would and the Bucks are still sitting in second in the East right so I think that's all back on it's like it's this is felt like this hugely disappointing season and yet they're kind of where we thought they would be yeah the but we just we see the weaknesses there they have enough talent to win regular season there's a lot of bad teams in the NBA and they have enough talent to just go out and win games in the regular season but we are seeing warts that you know are going to show and present themselves in the playoffs so I think we as NBA fans are Savvy enough to see right through the overall record this team is not built to be the second seed to make it to the finals you know and the thing with that obviously it's not a direct comparison because that Heat team is like one of the best ever assembled they still made it to the finals the first year in what felt like a really disappointing debut of the big three would you agree that if Milwaukee just makes it to that point this is been a win if they get to the final and lose in the finals they're good  that was not the case with Miami Miami had to win or it was a failure that's how that was I think you know Milwaukee be disappointed but if Milwaukee makes it past Boston and whoever in the Eastern Conference and then they lose to the nuggets in the finals I think you can go okay those are pretty good season this was a this was a win for Milwaukee this year I I think so I mean obviously the books and any honest would tell you if they lose the finals that's not what they wanted but I think given where we are right now if Milwaukee just makes the finals and you know if they lose in six games to Denver you know you're not gonna be like oh man this was a total disaster yeah getting to the finals at this point I think just emerging from the East yeah that would be huge I think the difference between that 2011 is that the heat were like minus 200 to win that Series right it's like not only did they get there it's like it felt like getting through the East was maybe gonna be their toughest challenge I think you could argue you know all the teams that LeBron is faced in the finals and his career it's like that that might have been the most winnable series he had right I mean that was a great Maverick team it was in was it at all time team it wasn't a team that people circled and said yeah that's the team to beat this year but yeah we'll see I mean  we're gonna look either smart or foolish two months from now you know Milwaukee's either gonna bow out and wrap and round two or maybe they do make the finals it wouldn't be that surprising whatsoever but yeah some of the underlying metrics from Milwaukee they've been better since the break but then you know these games like last night it felt like in years past you know the Bucks just they don't just go and lose by by 35 you know on the road in Sacramento like the down games from Milwaukee to me been a little bit more extreme this season I do want to note something you know you mentioned Milwaukee failing to get to 100 points which they've done a couple of times in the last couple of weeks I'm sure you've seen the narrative you know going around that you know there's been some Whispers that maybe the NBA I think using the All-Star game as a catalyst you know I think that was the final straw for Adam Silver the smart people that I've heard from you know I've said that it's the refereeing maybe has tightened up a little bit and that would explain why we've seen so many lower scoring games of late and you know I think it's easy to look at the extremes like that 79 73 Nick Sixers game this past Sunday but scoring in general is down significantly since the All-Star break like the the average team pre-all-star break was averaging about 115 points per game just short of 115 points per game post All-Star break League average is sitting at about 11 that's a pretty huge drop over the course of like a month  yeah what I don't know is one of those things that I would love to see what is this look like every year because I feel like this happens every season the all star breaks some teams are giving up other teams that are good like like Milwaukee you know Milwaukee Boston these top teams that know that their real season is about to start at a month they're like ready to get on with it and so you only have a few teams that that are really putting their best foot forward that care about these games like their big games and then and even those teams their dog tired at this point all these back-to-backs three games in four nights I think the season just catches up with you that would be my assessment is not so much an officials thing but just an exhaustion of the season and it's kind of like the dog days in the summer of baseball where you're like is this ever gonna end that I get the feeling that these players are sort of in that mode but in order to back that up I would have to look at what happens post All-Star break over the last several seasons  why we'll say I mean average free throw attempts per game are also down by about three three throw attempts per game per team so that would you know there may be something there but yeah I mean I don't think the answer was like an email like an email from Adam Silver that he sends out during the All-Star break like hey guys he's up on those whistles yeah well I mean Milwaukee took 35 free throws last night so it's Case by case but it is interesting that and we've had five games where a team of scored 80 or fewer points this year and they've all come in the last two plus weeks which is something to monitor something to keep an eye on we're not seeing what yeah I've watched about four of those they're ugly yeah well Orlando was involved in a couple of them Portland has been a culprit as well let's talk rocket Spurs another big night for Victor webmin Yama relatively big I mean this is this actually goes down as like an off night for him and he still has a you know a double-double with six assists two blocks and a steal but I think the Houston side of this is more interesting because we really had no sample of what this rotation would look like without shame good it only missed one game all season prior to last night Rockets end up going with a smaller starting lineup even against somebody who has size of women yamas so they go Jabari Smith I'm in Thompson Dillon Brooks Fred Van Fleet and Jalen green they did not have Cam Whitmore last night for what it's worth  we thought jock landale you know when maybe be the obvious villain he's kind of the only other real Center on the roster they do have boban  didn't even play a minute last night so I think you know any any delusions of a boban joining the rotation without shengwen or probably dead but Lando did play 26 minutes off the bench 11 points 5 assists four boards two Steals and a block I am interested in landale you know in a deeper League Australia you know 14 16 teams I think he's probably worth grabbing I think you know there might be some nights in certain matchups where they do throw him in the starting lineup but by default you know he might be a 25-30 minute guy he also had four follows last night so you know it's tough to say if that you know may have impacted his minute ceiling this is just a team that doesn't really have a whole lot of debt that Center they don't really have an Avenue to add somebody at this point I don't think they really care and as we know if you're if you're just tuning in Outrage and very unlikely to return at any point this season still I'm saying good though some good news right I mean the injury they ended up diagnosing it as a grade 3 ankle sprain which  kind of how that looked oh my God yeah you mean when I first saw that I thought  well he's he's gonna miss part of next season right that was my first thought when he went down so this is a sucks for this year and for those that are entering the playoffs and and we're relying on his production because he's probably been your best player second best player so sucks that you lose that but but on the you know for us and the fantasy community and and those that rank you don't have to really worry too much about shengwen and where you're gonna play some next year you should be fine the Landell things interesting because I feel like they just threw them in there to beat up Viktor wynd Benihana last night and he was able to mop up some stats on top of it women Yama should have had a much bigger stat line going up against the lineup this small I want to see this guy he is extremely skilled that goes without saying like the his handles his ability to shoot the three step back shoot threes his his blocking around the rim he his skill is insane passing you know you've detail that here on this podcast probably the most underrated part of his game the thing that I haven't really seen him do enough of outside of a few highlights is Bully ball I want I want to see him go you're gonna put a guy who's six eight on me really and and just take it to him and he had the opportunity to do that last night against the smaller Houston Rockets lineup  and just didn't see that that's the kind of progression that I want to see from Victor women because once he adds that part to his game he'll be literally Unstoppable  yeah I mean I have I noticed a pearl of what it comes to weapon Yama I know I don't think we need to go down that road again and burn 10 minutes I mean talking about why I'm taking him number one in fantasy next year but you're right on the passing man I mean six assists last night and you know San Antonio 11 of 36 from 3 like he's leaving a cyst on the table every single night and you know I was going to go in and out of this game on league pass I saw a clip that somebody tweeted of Devon vessel literally dribbling the entire possession and having like four opportunities to pass the weapon Jama and just like running into him and backing up like it's still like a bad situation for women Yama teammates wise context wise and he's still putting up these numbers I think women like you can get his assist prop most nights at like three and a half  I love that absolutely love that and you know it you're relying on some shaky shooting I think to to come through on certain nights but I do think the market is lagging behind a little bit when it comes to women Jama and you know it was something that was disgusting a little bit you know coming into the draft but everybody focused on the defensive potential the jump shot you know the that the handles I think the  the thing that really separates I think the truly truly elite players in the NBA is almost all those guys could pass right if you're gonna be a top five player in the NBA  like love to monster was a bad example because he could pass I'm trying to think about you know who's like a  points rebounds guy you know or you know so these big men who don't quite have have that that Vision that women Yamaha has it's like you embed  what yeah I mean a beads assistant numbers have been better I think he's grown as a pastor a lot I think Giannis early in his career you can say that but he's improved a ton of the past I mean these guys are top five players so maybe it's a bad example but yeah I think women Yama has the elites Vision that you just cannot teach like that is I'm a pretty firm believer as somebody who's watched a lot of basketball played a lot of basketball  that's you can't just teach someone to to have that level of vision you know you either have it or you don't early in your career yeah yeah that's an innate treat and and that's what separates the the Uber greats the LeBron's dungeon now Victor women's  exactly yeah  chocolate and Dale you know the those guys they yeah there's a lot of talent in this league but the guys that see the game  three steps ahead and are able to set up their their teammates and make guys around them better that's what separates the guys are really good from the guys that are among the League's best and it's incredible that we're already having that conversation about Viktor wynd Beneva you're to start a franchise today yeah you know and I know in fantasy you're already ready to take number one in 2024 is drafts but like I don't know how many guys I would get through yeah if any if I was starting a franchise today  just in general it hits him right I mean yeah you could say there's a case for yokich SGA if I mean if you really want to throw you on us in their sure but no it's it's women yeah if we were starting a League wide fantasy draft right now  there's no way anybody but Victor webinar would go number one Speaking of assist by the way I got to read off the static I looked this up the other night when I was watching the nuggets and it was because of mpj it was taking some insane shots that was just like what is this a sister and his sister it's actually not as bad as it was earlier in his career but I didn't looked into like who had like the worst assist right ever  2014-15 Hassan Whiteside you know this is Peak white side LeBron LeBron's back in Cleveland heater look at looking for something they signed white side  by side played 1,000 100 and 142 minutes that season and he had six total assists one assist per 100 90 minutes played  that's not great  he was the kind of guy the second yeah he would well the second he would get the ball that man was trying to put it in the rim every single time yeah let's try to pass tell you that no  it was lobbying like half assists per game that's crazy 190 minutes per one assist  yeah he he was very he was very one dimensional in the way that he the way that he approached the game  that's right yeah that's what Miami was willing to move off of that even though they overpaid him yeah well he ended up in Sacramento he always got like he was on the Collision Course too to be a Sacramento King  all right speaking of the Rockets rotation Paul says I picked up a man Thompson right after sheng's injury not sure what to do with them after yesterday's performance trying to stick with the give a player three games rule which in general I think it's a good strategy but what do you guys think  so I you know it's tough with Shane good because obviously landale is the one to one you know positional all right make sense submitted to go to him type of fit but you know a man could kind of play all over right I mean he's played a ton of minutes at shooting guards fall forward even power forward this season so I think there is some trickle down there and you know he was back in the starting lineup for the first time in a month last night  yeah like you said Paul I didn't really do much 23 minutes you know six points for boards to assist one steal I you know I would give it some time I mean he's one of those guys and it feels like every two or three games he'll just give you like six combined Steals and blocks and I think that's really what's going to be most Dependable with them he's a great great rebounder for his size and for his position eligibility so I still think there's something here I mean what you do have to keep in mind though is can't Whitmore but he's going to be out you know for at least three weeks so  and this could be a situation where we don't even see Whitmore again this season so if we're was coming back like later this week I'd be a little more concerned but I think because of that you know you're gonna have a longer Runway here with with the tops you know this is where the shingo injury could could actually turn out to be a positive for the Houston Rockets because at least with the diagnosis of it not being that serious but they are in developmental mode they already know what they have in operation goon and he's developed in a big way this year I don't know that another month in the season was going to make him a extremely proved basketball player from what we've already seen from him I'm in Thompson now gets an opportunity to slide into that starting lineup and they're not just gonna feed him but he's gonna have opportunities and this is sometimes when we see rookies that have not really hit their stride yet put together a few good games I think this happened with Jabari Smith the bill last year where he just was struggling to find his spot in the end of the year they're just said hoop and he started to really put it together I think I'm in Thompson could be looking at something just like that  yeah Jabari Smith is somebody I'm curious about too I actually was hoping we'd see a little bit more of a boost from him last night I mean kind of a tough matchup you know he was he was matched up with what manyama for for a decent chunk of the night we did still hit his points over on the RotoWire NBA show that was 14 and a half he got to 15 you know you would think that he's somebody that we saw last night you know slides up to Center well he's already playing a decent amount of minutes so we'll see if there's you know much more of a ceiling there but you spent the stuff because he's  we've talked about this a lot last year too I mean he's kind of a super role player right and we knew that going into the draft you know he's not somebody who's going to command shots you know he's not going to go get the ball and go one-on-one and we know don't Brooks will do that we know for example he'll do that we know Jalen green will do that can't win more when he's out there one of the highest usage can't wait more is a higher usage rate the ball George on the season by the way so I think Javari Smith in some ways  you know he's kind of a victim of the situation I'm still pretty in on him as far as what he can be long term but you know I I don't like the thought of him you know just coming a higher usage guy in the context of this Rockets roster I don't know how realistic that's going to be Christian says good morning fellas good morning Christian I need to trade away Laurie Marketing in a points League yes you do thoughts on some targets with high upside for Silly Season  yeah I I think a lot of people are in this situation man you know they're still going game to game with marketing in he missed his fourth straight last night with what is apparently just like a Bruce quad  I think you know the writing's been on the wall for a little bit here with Utah I think they're okay kind of back in their way out of this thing trying to preserve their draft pick to the best of their ability  it's really tough to say if this is a shutdown like it wouldn't be shocked either way I mean this would be a lot they still have a decent chunk of games remaining right I mean there's there's what like 16 17 games left I believe for them so the fact that I wouldn't say marketing is just done for the year but I think we're kind of in the Jaron Jackson Zone with him where it's like he could come back play a few games that's back to back we'll sit out like it's just not a situation that you want to be a part of so if you can offload him I will say you may have missed the window you know as far as we're turning the type of value that you might want but at the same time you know it I think there's still a way you can come out on top here from a gameplay perspective so where do we draw the line Brandon as far as like what what so in a player should you try to be shopping in yes it's a good question of its trying to come up with some names as you were going through that explanation and it does seem like a really good time to well a good time to move off of one of the few weeks ago but now if you know you're desperate to just find somebody that can give you something a little bit more reliable just looking at overall points and guys like Austin Reeves been lighting it up as of late you know I'm on his point three about in the system over tonight he's been really consistent reliable that could be a guy that you know maybe he's not the star that marking is but he's been um but he's been really reliable in terms of his production that can be a guy you look at Myles Turner if someone who's willing to flip him he's been blocking shots like crazy lately and that Pacers defense is actually turned things around yeah that's just if you're in the need to offload  if you could get Myles Turner you got to do it I just I don't think you can even if anybody who's paying attention I don't think they're giving you Myles Turner right I mean that's a team that like they got to play this thing out they're trying to avoid the play in I I think Myles Turner is like too good right now for you know I think anybody you're trying to you're trying to shop marketing too they're gonna know the same thing that we know right and be like well I don't even know if this guy's gonna play again like is he gonna play 50% of the games the rest of the way I think you got to aim lower to be honest you know Jabari Smith honestly is the name who comes to mind I think if you get Jabari Smith at this point I would think about it you know you could try like the precious that you are out I know there's some concern that you know once Julius Randle comes back maybe his minutes decreased Mitchell Robinson allegedly still coming back at some point Kelly Olynyk out there Toronto I mean I I truly think that's kind of the the type of player you need to be looking for like these guys who rank you know like 70 to 100 like I really think you're gonna have to take a pretty steep discount to get off a marketing right now  I would prefer to go the two for one route rather than just give up on him like that in the case that he does come back because man you're taking a bath that's the case then you probably right like there's no reason for anybody to accept the deals that I just offer I would start with that wait for the decline and then hit him with the reality  yeah yeah I think that's fair all right Paul says 12 team 9 cat League I currently have the following guys on waivers Scoot a men and Subs do I drop any of those three to pick up these available players cam Johnson Kyle Anderson Bruce Brown Andrew nem hard or Derek Lively um  yeah that's interesting you know  Kyle Anderson's missed a game the other night I'm not  not super enthused with him overall you know cam Johnson's missed the last three but he is probable to play tonight so he should be back in the mix I had played well before his latest injury  I'll let you talk about songs is he somebody you'd consider dropping or do you want to hold him  no he was out for a couple of games but he's right back in the mix tonight and the magic he's been playing I'll give you a reason to feel good about sucks he has played  infinitely better on the home floor he's the energy guy he brings the juice and the building and he's just one of those like a lot of role players they play better in their home arena the magic play the rest of the month they have one road game left in the month of March  so he is gonna this is probably this could be his most productive month of the entire season this is not the time to move off of him okay okay um yeah I'm Bruce Brown he started the other night and you know Toronto's down like everybody right now and you know I think some of those guys are coming back some aren't but they were without you know quickly Trent you know RJ Barrett's missing time he's gonna miss another game coming up with a personal issue obviously Pirtle and barns are out who she's gonna miss time so like I I've never really been a Bruce Brown guy I always thought he's been a little bit overrated especially in terms of fantasy but I think Toronto is just out of dudes and he's gonna play Big minutes so I I think of those guys Bruce Brown to me is probably the most appealing I'm not a huge nem hard guy I know he started I know he's playing minutes he's very Hit or Miss night to night Kyle Anderson like we said did not play you know on Sunday against the Lakers return play 29 minutes to get the clips last night looked okay 10 points 7 assists five boards he's not gonna give you a ton of consistent defense of production he's obviously not going to hit any threes so in a category league if you need assists I think Kyle and  makes sense if you're doing okay and assist I would stay away  yeah so um I the scoot thing I still struggle with because I did just want to see so much more out of him I'm in Thompson we just talked about him I don't think this is the time to move off they're gonna give him a lot of Runway and Suggs I think this would be the one of the worst times of the year to move off of of that particular player he's gonna give you the threes he's been hitting those at a much higher rate this year the Steels will be there and all of that takes up at home I would I I really like Andrew hard I think that the way that Indiana is starting to play this you know they got through that little rough spell after the All-Star break I sat back and watch it in Indiana Oklahoma City game this is a completely different unit but they they have finally really infused Pascal siakam into this lineup and they're starting to play some real defense too and Andrew M heart is a big part of what they want to do right now especially with Ben math and not a part of the mix they need all these other guys to step  up and I really like the way he's playing so I would I would swap scoot out for nem Harding keep the other two  all right we got a question from loyal viewer Matt Carmody says Hey guys would you drop buddy hield for meccan or scoot in a head-to-head points League it says playoffs start next week yeah I mean he'll become less valuable in a point we know that right he's one of those one of those guys who has like kind of the biggest difference between category and points League value just because of the high volume threes you know he's been fine as a pastor you know serviceable is a rebounder it's not like he's kind of corporate here he does some other things but I think it's a reasonable question in a points league for sure  I mean Mitch is is so interesting he's tethered so tightly to trade man and lamelo ball and I feel like we say this every week  I don't think well Mellows coming back at this point man and if he does you know whatever I mean it's been such a long layoff I don't really know what the point would be bringing it back hasn't played since January 26th they're kind of running out of time they're playing out the string you know Trey man is questionable to return to night  I think you should still have some value if one of those guys is back obviously it's a mellow comes back both man and he should take a huge hit but I just look good man he started five in a row now in that Spanish averaging 146 and 4 with a steel you know it doesn't do much for me on the ark he's not a good shooter but in a points League that doesn't matter as much and then scoot on the other hand you know he's a better Point silly guy right he's kind of the anti healed because he's a terrible shooter he turns it over a ton but he is gonna give you the counting stats and I think they're gonna unleash him going forward so we've been saying this all year there will be a time when it makes sense to roster scoot Henderson and this this may be the time especially in a points league so I'll ask you buddy hield or scoot Henderson  yeah I think I'd rather have scoot I can't quit this guy  all season long I was way too in on him at the start of the season and yeah hell we're in the mid March already and and they're still debate to be had on this guy I I've been to in on him for too long to hop off that bandwagon right now but yeah me too she's been really good he's led the team in points are assists on either one or the other sometimes both on numerous occasions over the last several nights and they still three games left this week next week though just you know if you're if you've got a set your lineup for a full week he only played twice they've a game on Tuesday and Saturday so they get a bunch of time off after this week something that something to consider for those are the reason why I was looking at the the article that you guys put out like this past Sunday the the waiver wire guys was like the entire Hornets roster and meech was was part of that he's delivered  well that's that's kind of where we're at right now at this point in the season good question here from Dennis three games of lively or Royce O'Neill this week  I I think I would go Lively the Dallas front court is still kind of messy it's like all three of Washington Gafford and Lively are all playing minutes now and Gafford by the way I mean we left it for Dad a week and a half ago when he was playing like you know 11 minutes a game he has since gone 28 for 28 from the field over his last four games 28 428 from the field I will repeat coming off of one of his better games of the season I mean last three games you started an average 16/7 in two and a half blocks but Lively you know returned against Chicago the other night and had a huge game in his own right I mean that was a blowout so you know nuggets end up winning that or not get Maverick turned up winning that by I think 35 he had 22 points on 11 of 12 shooting  you know I think there are certain nights where one of those guys is going to be squeezed out you know maybe maybe it's Washington giving that he's been the guy who's played worse over the last couple of weeks but I I personally would favor Lively overall I think he's gonna give you a higher floor I think he's got a pretty good matchup at home tonight against the Warriors another good matchup tomorrow against it okay see team that all so lacks size yeah I think this comes down to which team do you trust more I have no idea what Brooklyn is doing this time of year so I kind of want to get out of that business and write something else on the Suns bad news  oh no oh no oh yeah yeah that's right okay I'm sorry I was looking at his Brooklyn number if you want to talk if you want to trash the Nets that's totally I'm not sure how that's relevant but  oh man I got brush up on my on my my deadline news yeah but either way Derek Lively was still gonna be my either way Derek Lively was gonna be my choice here both of these guys are gonna give you games where you get absolutely nothing but Lively seems to be more part of the mix of what Dallas wants to do moving forward and you know the yeah you're gonna get that sort of rotation where Daniel Gafford is going to get his but I still think in terms of consistency Derek Lively is is a is bringing it more so than Royce O'Neill formerly of the Brooklyn Nets  right we have a question on Jared Jackson is he going to be shut down soon my Yahoo League trade deadline is already over so maybe a drop our question asked her says he's representing the Taiwanese fans by the way so thank you we are Global show we strive to be and we appreciate the support their uh yeah definitely shut down candidate I think Jaron Jackson and Lori Market in our basically in  the exact same zone right now they're actually at the same injury as well Jaron Jackson has been a little bit more consistently in the lineup but if you look at you know really the last month since the start of February it's like missed two games play Four miss one plays three Miss three play three you know didn't play last night against Washington they're saying now that he's gonna be questionable for tonight's game against Charlotte on a back-to-back  after that they they don't have another back-to-back until the second to last week of the season so I think Jackson is still going to be in and out of the lineup I do think there's a decent chance that they just completely pulled the plug at the end of the year but we also got news earlier this week that Desmond Bane is apparently planning to return at some point so it's like if if you're bringing a Desmond Bane back to play to play a handful of games at the end of the year it's like it doesn't really line up that you would shut Jerry Jackson down I kind of love this Memphis Grizzlies team right now they had every reason and maybe they've tried and just been unsuccessful to completely paketid and do everything that they can possibly do to lose basketball games they are so competitive night to night more so than some of the other teams that really should we should be saying this about they are a scrappy group and I I think there's the there's sort of like a culture it has to be a culture thing within the organization what that tells me is they're not as interested in the shutdown guy as some of these other teams like we've been wearing about Portland all year I don't think they're going to get into that business if a guy can play he can play they're not gonna throw somebody out there who's not ready but yeah I mean I've gained a lot of confidence in what Memphis is doing and I don't even know if it's smart but I just I respect their approach because this is a team that  as somebody who bets the NBA tonight you can still bet the Grizzlies and that's not something you can say about a lot of bottom dwellers  it's not for the faint of heart I'll tell you that Charlotte and Washington it's like good luck figuring that out but yeah I mean they they've been about his competitive as they could be despite Fielding half of a Julie roster Washington last night by the way was a road favorite in Memphis for the first time all season first time all year Washington and Benny Road favorite and they end up losing that game by double digits I want to finish on this which so which team we get a lot of questions this time of year about shutdowns rotations things of that nature obviously all the teams that are in the play and mix and above I think those teams are good you know it's like at the end of the year it's like a Boston's up eight games in the East yeah like maybe maybe they get it you know Tatum and brown take a couple games off but not really worried about that  of the of the teams that are below the plain Zone who do we trust who do we not trust you know I think Portland Memphis Utah those are the three that have kind of been a thorn in our side I think Charlotte's in that mix but you talk about a team like Memphis still being competitive still playing out the strings still trying to bring someone like that has been paying back you know what do we think about you know Toronto Detroit Washington or every word about any shutdowns there um yeah but with I think Detroit you have to be it would be so foolish for them to do that though they're bad with whoever they throw out there so I don't think it's really on that necessary they need to develop Portland would definitely be we've been worried about that they might be at the front of the list Utah we talked about them they're definitely one of those teams wouldn't Shock Me with Brooklyn you know that's why I brought them up before this is this is a team that right now is they're three and a half games back on a play in spot they're kind of going nowhere fast and I don't think it would take many more losses for them to just say let's pack it in and mikal bridges maybe we don't see him for the rest of the year I you know I can't see really Toronto doing it they don't feel like the kind of organization that goes that route  Ronaldo I worry about a little bit for one they have the injuries that you know I think what's Scottie Barnes went down it was like that count as a shutdown though not really not really but I think an injury like that kind of gives you carte blanche as an organization to be like all right well our hands are tied you know what are we gonna do and as we mentioned on the show a number of times they owe a top six protected pick so the San Antonio Spurs that would be even in this draft which everybody says is bad and I'm telling you it's not gonna be that bad you don't want to just hand over the six pick I don't care like there's not a single draft where you're just like yeah whatever we don't want this Lottery Pick and I think that's something that  they're going to be cognizant of going forward yeah who can they shut down though like if it's Scotty Barnes is the only one that we would consider Merit I don't know man I mean I'm just saying like they are right now they have the seventh worst record and they're basically tied with the Memphis Grizzlies for that like they they want to get to six if they can't they like I know it's a difference of like four percentage points or whatever but that matters like holding on to that pick I think for Toronto right now would be pretty huge whether you want to use it whether you want to trade it whatever I I just I think if I'm Toronto I'm doing everything I can to give myself the best odds to not send the number six pick to the San Antonio Spurs yeah it's a good point I mean that that sort of information is you know that's invaluable this time of year I just don't know that they really there's some teams that just don't need to put in extra work to be where they need to be as RJ Barrett really worth how many wins is RJ Barrett worth I'm not I'm just not overly concerned I think that Scotty Barnes worrying about the do we may have seen the last of Scotty Barnes think that that is a fit that would be a fair assessment yeah I mean that's it that's the beauty of the play-in tournament do you have teams that are you know hovering around that nine 10 range in the East and the west and like we're not even considering them those teams want to be involved all of them  yeah yeah you're right all right well and on this good question from Maddie says do you think Luke will be suspended in the fantasy playoffs he has two more technical fouls left yeah it's that we go through this every year I feel like at the end of the season with Luca where you know a lot of guys reach that like that they get right close to that threshold and then they can somehow you know keep their their temperatures under control  it's something to monitor I wouldn't worry too much about it like I certainly wouldn't be like trying to trade Luka because I'm worried he might be suspended for a game because because of text I mean Dallas is one of those teams that needs to win games to try to stay out of the play in so I think yeah you know Luca can be a bit of a hot head that time but I think he can get it under control and I just don't think there's a whole lot we could do fantasy wise right it's like it's something that's in the back of your mind but you know I'm not I'm not trying to get off of Luka doncic because of that fear yeah I have a tough enough time predicting how these games are going to go it definitely can't predict who's gonna get teed up and Luca doesn't feel like he's not like a dream on green hothead who actually loses his cool Luka doncic is very calculated in the way that he complains and then sometimes he gets teed up because of it  if he knows that he's got a suspension looming he'll he'll dial it back I think it's more like Euro complaining than anything else that's like he grew up watching soccer so you knows what that life is like  all right thanks for all the good questions in the chat guys we're gonna wrap it up here we will have Dr Ray and Rick Campbell back at you tomorrow afternoon actually probably around around noon Eastern you keep an eye out for them we'll have the waiver wire episode
