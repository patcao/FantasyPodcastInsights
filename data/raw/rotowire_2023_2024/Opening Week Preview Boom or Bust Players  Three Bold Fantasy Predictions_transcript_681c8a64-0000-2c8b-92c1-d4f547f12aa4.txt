Hello friends and welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast sponsored by Underdog Vivid Seats and rival fantasy it's Tuesday October 24th my special guest today is my former co-worker at NBC know Ruben  let's do this  Noah how we doin' today  talk I'm doing great it's it's a good day when you have I guess six months of no regular season basketball four months of no meaningful basketball just a little bit of Summer League in preseason sprinkled in but doc it is opening night in the NBA doesn't get much better than that  it's sort of like fake opening night because there's only two games and and Wednesday I think everybody else is playing so Wednesday's the big one when you know everybody who has a fantasy basketball team like almost their whole team will be in action you'll have full lineups lineup decisions to make well tonight's just sort of the precursor to that where there's only 14 and actually the Lakers are at Denver at 7:30 and the suns are at Golden State at 10:00 those are both TNT games so if you have television you should be able to watch NBA basketball tonight and the games actually matter  yeah you won't even have to use League Pass it'll be right there on your TV it'll be great we'll get to see Nicola yokich not care that he won a trophy but he'll get a ring and just kind of say cool guys and then just go play some basketball and then  Warriors Sons will be fun as well a lot of I mean Kevin Durant against his old team Chris Paul gets his old team  no Bradley Beal that is a little bit disappointing that he won't be playing but it should still be a good game that's sort of a bad Omen to the start of Bradley Beal season if he can't even get out there for game one due to a back injury sounds like he's not going to play and Devin Booker his son's teammate is a game time decision with a toe injury I think Booker's probably good to go it sounds like you practice recently I think it's just precautionary more than anything but Beale it's probably out and for a team that's kind of favored to do really well in the west they need these guys healthy if they're going to be able to get that done so  do you have Bradley Beal shares anywhere  I think I have him in one League that I did is just a ESPN points league with some friends from college that I got Bradley Beal like two or three rounds later than he should have gone I said okay I guess I kind of have to take him here but not in any of my not most of my League's I don't  I have zero Bradfield shares and I feel pretty good about that another guy know who's gonna step up and Bealls place tonight is it good one is it who's the other one I saw shoot  there's I'm pulling it up right now to try it I got off the screen it could be Eric Gordon it could be Grayson Allen Grayson Allen it yeah I think Grayson Allen is probably  going to to play a lot tonight I I have a feeling he's gonna do okay but that's just a guess we don't really know because we have seen these guys yet but um  good one Gordon Grayson and I like gray and like if I was gonna play FanDuel tonight I probably probably take a flyer on Grayson Allen he's he's gonna be super cheap  now another injury  update is that Draymond Green is probably not playing for the Warriors  yeah another that's  another bad omen  yeah I think he's been the past few weeks trying to be ready for this business on reports but if he's not playing then they'll probably have both Chris Paul and Kevon Looney starting Steve Carell won't have to make that tough decision if he's bringing Off the Bench for at least one game which is probably a cyber relief from him he doesn't have to tell Chris Paul that he's on the bench or Draymond making dream on start at Center again how the sun's probably wouldn't have been the worst team to start Jane monitor against but I'll have to wait to make that decision and Jonathan comingo will play a really big role Off the Bench I'd imagine it with no dream on he had a really really good preseason probably won't score as much as he did during the preseason because he won't just have that green light that he had when he was on the floor but should still be a very effective option for them  yeah kou manga is another guy like in DFS tonight Draymond Green is officially out of that game so humongous should have a good opportunity in game one  but regardless of who's playing and who's not basketball is here and we could not be happier about that no I threw some  no what's your what's your Twitter what's your Twitter handle it's at know it is 22 22 yep yeah so no he's got a podcast called take me later  on the FBI Network and you check that out he spent a day with Dr a which is me last week and we hung out in my family room and talked Hoops for an hour we also it was all so some Story Time storytelling you can find that on on mine or Noah's Twitter feed no I put some polls out there on Twitter or X or whatever last night that I've thought were kind of interesting I it felt like everybody was into Victor wembanyama for the last year and the whole race to see who was going to get women Jana  was was fun but then after that first preseason game I felt like a lot of people jumped off to win the bandwagon saying that he was too too skinny he needed more weight on his body he was gonna get broken in the NBA he wasn't gonna play a full season for pop yada yada yada  but he has been getting drafted sometimes at the end of round one almost always Lately by the end of round two I've got him on a ton of teams  just because I love drafting women yeah I put out there a poll I said women Yamaha Boomer bust  91%  of the 360 votes he got  people think he's gonna be a boom  91% who I think at his I don't know what is Yahoo ADP is right now but for a while there was early third round mid-third round and I think if you said boom from there that cool you just believe in him that he's gonna have a really good year I think that it's not really in question I think he is gonna have a phenomenal rookie season especially for what we've seen from him during the preseason but I did a draft last night and Adam King took him at 13 I don't really see how he booms from 13 I think it's you know that's probably his ceiling I mean that's the first round value for rookie that doesn't happen very often so for him to Boom from early second round or first round not really there for me but he could return that value I don't really see him booming from there but if you're getting him in round three or four which is kind of where he was going before the preseason then you could say boom but I think at this point where he's being drafted I have to say buzzed but not bust that he's gonna be horrible but bust in the sense that he's probably  going to return third or fourth round value because he's a rookie and he might struggle with a few things okay those are all fair points I didn't specify fantasy lingo or Universe in that poll just like is when we gonna live up to the hype or is he gonna is pop gonna sit him you know one game a week and not let him play as much as we want to see him play I think people including me himself I think he's gonna be out there a lot more than maybe we initially thought I just think people are excited about women and and want to see him play and think he's gonna be really good and hopefully he blocks a ton of shots to Seasons so that I can win a Jersey from you I took one be against Walker Kessler to lead the league in to lead in blocks this season and  you know eight foot wingspan he's flying all over the court I'm still feeling it I'm not not upset by that  Jersey that even though Walker Kessler may look like a better option on paper  another one I threw out there was Chet Chet homegrown Boomer boss  84.5% of the folks out there think that Chet is going to also be a boom only 15% are saying bust and these guys he's a skinny as women Yama is he was out all last season with a foot injury but he was going more like fourth fifth round it'll be easier for him to boom and fantasy I think from from that slot then trying to have when be live up to the hype of being a late first early second round pick  definitely you probably have to get him in round three now but I think is 80 people probably be in round four or five if you did it a month ago we probably would have been able to get him there that's fine but it seems maybe maybe it's just how it seems to me but since they're preseason matchup you have to pick them at least around 2 earlier just because of how much fun it was and how good they both work  I think that Chet and Wendy can both be producing around the same value so getting checked a couple rounds later even if it does feel early at around 3 at this point I feel better about Chet booming from his ADP then when be because I think that they're going to have similar Seasons I think women will be a little bit better probably averaged a little bit more points but Chad will probably be a little bit better on the glass because he'll be the starting center as a powerful was that Colin is down there so similar Seasons when he probably a little bit better but at their price I got to go check and then two guys that I've become obsessed with I was kind of late to the party here  but Kobe White  I think is gonna start at point guard for the Bulls he's looked really good in the preseason he looks he looked good at the end of last season I kind of think he's turned the corner and it's gonna have a good year you can get him super late and fantasy drafts I just took him in my 30 Team league yesterday like  100 and 120 or 125 something like that he's gonna start for that 30 team Lee I put a Kobe white Boomer bus pull out there 45% say boom 55% say bust  what is your thought on a Kobe White yeah it looks like he's going to be the starter in Chicago it wouldn't be shocking if Billy Donovan kind of Switched things up as the season goes along but it seems like he's gonna start from opening night during the preseason was able to score in double figures and four out of his five games but scoring a really been an issue for him but he did have at least three assists in all of his games and from it will do quick math on top of my head it looks like the average forces per game during the preseason despite only playing over 25 minutes once average 2.8 assists per game last year so if he can get that playmaking boost I have no problem taking him in the last few rounds  so I think probably around 11 is a sweet spot because any later is a bargain that's great but I don't know how much early I'm going to take him then round 11 just because his he does have a history of not being great in category leaks seems like he's turned the corner but it's it's still is a little bit of a risky pick but I I do think he'll have a pretty solid season  yeah I love him to 12th round I'm fine with Kobe white every time and if it doesn't work out you drop him and pick up somebody else another guy I'm like to the party on that I was about to mention was Jeremy Sohan for the Spurs it looks like Trey Jones is kind of out right now and and Sohan is is gonna play point forward for them apparently he's gonna be playing out there with women Yama and  oh vessel Devon vest vessel who I love also the Spurs are going to be fun to watch on on league pass this season I think  definitely especially at points so hands gonna be a lot of fun everybody in that lineup I think would be at least six Kelvin Johnson might be six five everybody's gonna be tall and a tall point guard will be fun Wendy's obviously gonna be a ton of fun so hands starting point guard should give him a nice fantasy boost I saw him the draft I did last night I think he went 90 which was a bit early to me but he could just totally pop off and be significantly better than that so we'll see as far as trade Jones I think it's interesting a lot of people I've seen say drop him okay he has no value now he's not the starter well he's still probably gonna play 25 minutes per game which is you know less than he was before but still play enough he'll be the point guard when he's in the game they're not gonna have him off the ball just because so hands in the game and he's their quote unquote point guard now but anytime anybody on the Spurs missed the game outside of maybe Zach Collins they probably Southern Center but Trey Jones would start like probably sliding into the starting unit if any of one through four misses a so he'll still be really effective in those games I'm still rostering him but I'm probably drafting him a couple rounds later than what he was going before which I believe was round nine so probably 11 or 12 but he'll still be a very solid option he's not going to Boom but he can he can be serviceable  yeah I feel like Trey Jones and tyus Jones were both kind of  getting drafted near each other and then Trace kind of falling off and he's available later in his looks like the better option but anyway that's some of the some of the stuff going on as we get ready for opening night no Underdog fantasy is the number

 no let's look at Wednesday night 12 games 24 teams in action the Spurs are playing the Thunder playing the Hawks Pacers a Kobe white is playing with the bulls I'm really curious as to what this Mavericks lineup and rotation is going to look like I want to see  if Luca plays I want to see if Kyrie plays I want to see who those guys are gonna throw it to we get wimby and Chet I mean there's so much going on Wednesday y'all better get the league pass fired up and clear your calendar from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.  yeah it's gonna be a really fun night you mentioned Dallas and San Antonio everybody saw the practice Clips so of Dallas having their trainers hold large I don't even know what they were but to make them look like when be and look like everybody's really long Defenders closing out really tall just to help them get used to it because it it is kind of legal altering bringing the seven foot four seven foot five guy in that can dribble and move really well so it's it's funny to see how teens are reacting to having to match up with him for the first time but Dallas is rotation is going to be really interesting because Kyrie played in their last preseason game I would just assume that means he's available for opening night but we'll see Luca's I think I read that he started practicing again but we don't really know what that looks like for opening I would assume that if he's able to give it to go he will which hopefully that'll be fun Luke and Kyrie versus one be well throw them to sell one BMW sell just to make it like two stars right there so it should be a fun matchup for that opening night  um yeah opening nights just gonna be insane I can't I really can't wait for for Wednesday Thursday's fun because it's actually opening night  but I mean Wednesday's fun because it's actually like Tuesday's fun because it's actually opening up but Wednesday is gonna be that's gonna be there we go are you having any posts  Fantasy Draft regrets do you have guys that you have taken that you're you're kind of pushing the panic button on already  um not yet I think I'll probably maybe have some after the first week but I don't think there's anybody that I'm  that I've drafted so far that I'm like man that was well there's probably our something that I said that was a bad pick but I don't think there's anybody on my roster that I'm like  and I really don't think they're going to be good I might drop them or  try and look to trade them as quickly as I can but that'll all change that will change was in the first week I wouldn't be surprised at all the only guy I don't even think I have Luke in any league but I think that would be a slight concern but I'm not also regretting ever drafting Luka to the league so  yeah I'm I I guess Trey Jones would be one of my one of my guys that I'm I'm a little disappointed where I have him but really most of my most of my drafts were all similar young guys with a lot of upside down there is an ESPN draft that I did know it and I look at this roster and I just just kind of shake my head and I was able to pull this off but I got Anthony Edwards I have wimby I have Chet I have Jaron Jackson Jr who I got in round four my goodness I still can't really wrap my head around points League  no it's not there's only there's only 10 teams but it's categories the round four so you're not I mean that's the people on Twitter were like what why is Jared Jackson Jr going in for brown I'm taking him as early as you know 12 13 14 so the fact that he fell at that far I really don't understand but that team also has Josh giddey it has Jalen Williams it has Devin vessel Andrew Wiggins who I think is due for a big comeback this season it's got bennedict mathurin but yeah with my big man on that team Jaron Jackson Jr Chet homegrown Victor women Yama and Alpine you know I don't think it's possible for me not to wind blocks outright every every single night yeah there's a no reason for you to not and it's crazy because you reach on Wendy and Chet and round two and three to make sure you get your guys so you're like okay cool I reach there and then Sharon Jackson Jr slips to you in round four because I think if you would have said you got Jared Jackson round two when be around three check Round 4 it would have been oh that's great values so and ended up working out really nicely for you it fell into my lap literally so um  let's see wait I got shit in four  I got shit for I got Jerry in at 28 in round three okay a little bit Yeah reasonable but still really good value there still I Jared Jackson Jr should not be there  at the end of round three even if it's a 10 million leak so pretty excited about that that team and that draft that was that was pretty fun okay let's see let's do this um the NBA

guys  feels like I did like a month or two ago and they were all guys I was able to get late and drafts and as more people or I guess as I've talked about him more other people have talked about them they slowly risen up so not able to get them quite as late you know is that Collin's is one of the five centers that I've been saying to get this year from between rounds I guess like seven to nine um so really like him this year as kind of the defender for Victor when Ben be the guy taking any hits than anybody puts out on one beat but also giving you good rebounds of three per game of Steel a block decent assist from the center spot so I really like him this year SAR Thompson should start in Detroit I like getting him around pick a hundred same thing with PJ Washington who should start for Charlotte now  I did like getting Josh Richardson there for a little bit I think he'll come off the bench and it doesn't look like he'll play opening night but his best seasons were in my Miami so I still like taking him towards the end of the draft and then my favorite late round last round guy which again started to go around or too early now is Jalen Johnson had a really good preseason probably won't start opening night but has a chance to earn a starting role at some point or at least play a pretty big role Off the Bench I think his versatility is something that went Schneider will really enjoy and having a four that can dribble will be a new experience for the Hawks  nice talk to me about this this dude on the Wizards that is suddenly  a go-to guy at the end of fantasy drafts I'm not I'm really not sure I can even say his name but I I'm guessing I know who you're talking about I'm guessing that you can  I was having to practice a little bit but it's Beadle Bali Bali yes I need to work on saying that a little bit smoother but I'm able to pronounce it from practice a little bit but I think he had in four preseason games or in his first four maybe he played a fifth that I'm just not updated on my stats but he had 10 steals in his first four preseason games averaged I mean that that's excuse me maybe it was 10 steals three preseason games it was a lot he had a lot of steals didn't he wasn't great anywhere else but his defense will get him on the floor I mean when you have Jordan Poole and Kyle kuzma taking over the offense nobody else gonna get a chance to shoot really so having another Defender out there in Cooley Bali to kind of take on the opposing team's lead scorer that'll get him on the floor and then he can get seals we've seen that and he'll have an opportunity as a rookie to work through things offensively and improve as the season goes on so  from opening night you're probably just getting Steals and you may have to deal with some struggles and other areas but I think as the season progresses he'll get better and better and that's why I'm so I'm glad you brought him up I have enjoyed taking him in the last two rounds as well yeah and you know I feel like he's gonna finally  put the nail in Denny of DJ's  whatever because Denny of these you know we've been waiting for like three years for him to do something and now you know the depth chart says that Kula Bali is gonna start in front of him  and you're gonna have a guy that's coming off that Washington bench like the lawn right Landry Shaman of deja Danilo Gallinari Washington is going to be a disaster from a reality standpoint but fantasy wise a lot of people love Danny effort and his ability to block shots from the center position this year a lot of people's favorite last round pick is the guy we just been talking about you and I have a little Jersey going on Jordan Poole's ability to score the basketball he's gonna be a volume shooter he's going to be taking tons of shots and Ty's Jones should be a very serviceable starting point guard for the Wizards I mean there's a lot to love about Washington from from a fantasy standpoint another guy that that I'm I've kind of been high on taking him you know in the later rounds is Andrew Wiggins and he plays for the Warriors where he we're gonna get to see him tonight Mr Huge chunk of the last season with some personal issues he also missed time with injuries didn't play in very many games kind of a kind of a big disappointment last year I just think he's poised and in the perfect position to bounce back pretty strong this season and I look for him to have a big game tonight with no dream on green  yeah I agree he's gonna have to play a larger role I've no dream on me is that I mean somebody's gonna have to try and go out there and guard Katie and it's not going to be Cavani and it's probably not going to be Klay Thompson so it's probably gonna be injured Wiggins they're gonna need him to do a lot he was awesome to start last season and then I know I've talked about this I'm just about every podcast I've talked about him missed about a month due to an injury and illness played a little bit and then he wasn't really quite the same player missed the final two months for personal reasons and then wasn't quite the same in the playoffs so I'm hoping he can get back to that player that he was to start last season when he was a top 25 guy and nine cat leagues I actually did in my draft last night got him at 74 which was a tad early but I was picking from Two and I knew he wasn't gonna get back around me and I'm a big believer in Angel Wiggins this year so probably a slight reach but I I think that he'll be able to return that level value if not more yeah round nine of that 10 man ESPN draft I was talking about is an interesting round because  it went Klay Thompson John Morant who's out for 25 games Jabari Smith Tobias Harris is possibly the most boring fantasy player in the land Jeremy Grant who's also pretty boring Keegan Murray I love the upside there Anthony Simons with no name should be fun Andrew Wiggins I got it 88 John Collins when it 89 and then Danny Gafford when it nine so so that's you know between 80 and 90 they're there's a lot of guys on that list that are having a chance to really do something the season what what are your thoughts on jobs did you did you take any flyers on John Moran and and are you patient enough to be able to wait 25 games without me being able to put them on the IR  no I don't have them anywhere I think other people were more ambitious than I was I think getting him at  I think I've seen him generally go kind of round seven I would definitely take him around eight or nine but I don't really love him in nine cat League's when he's healthy or even not healthy but when he's available he's he's good he's not quite as good as he is in points  and then missing the first 25 games I just I'd rather in round six or seven I feel like I like a lot of guys in that range as well so I would rather go with those guys whether it be Devin the cells going earlier now but he was a guy Andrew Wiggins Jeremy Grant Anfernee Simons a lot of those centers that I like we talked about that Collin's Daniel Gaffigan Mark Williams I'd rather go with a few of those guys and then generally around 9 or 10 is when I start taking a little bit more risk and that's where I would take a guy that's suspended the first 25 games I've if somebody else wants to take him earlier that's fine he is a very good player and he's gonna give you plenty of points rebounds and assists especially rebounds for a point guard  I just didn't end up getting him anywhere because he generally went before I was willing to take him  uh same I don't think I ended up with any job maybe maybe one League I did but it was a mocking and I don't have to worry about what I'm gonna do with him we're not playing that one out  I'm looking at another guy that I kind of like in that Andrew Wiggins area is Bruce Brown of the Indiana Pacers I'm kind of kind of hyping him up it's getting paid a lot of money to play for the Pacers he's going to be a strong veteran presence there  I guess  let me give you some names and tell me who you would take out of this kind of this group  Tre Jones  Bruce Brown  Terry Rozier shade on Sharp  or CJ McCollum  honestly I'd probably go Rozier first  and then it would be  how goodness we I probably be Bruce brown or CJ McCollum maybe depending on my build if I'm not putting field goal percentage that might be Bruce Brown first over Terry's here and CJ McCollum with a punt field goal percentage would probably be those two ahead of Bruce Brown and then trade Jones and then shade and sharp who I think should have a pretty sizeable role with Portland and we'll be able to shoot a lot but I don't really know I think I like to him a little bit and then after hearing some other people talk about it he'll score and he'll probably hit some threes but I don't really know what else what other categories he's providing value and I think he's fine and point sleeks but in category League's He he'll probably just be providing some points and he may not even start if they want to go with Matisse liable to have at least somebody out there that's gonna focus on defense and not just focus on getting their own shot because everybody else that's starting lineup is like that so I like his upside long term but I think for this year I don't really know how much he's providing so he's last for me on that list wow yeah I I like shade on quite a bit I have him in a few League's I didn't get him in some I took Bruce Brown in front of shit on Sharp in that that 10 man draft  if if in game dunking were a fantasy category I think he'd probably go in like the fourth round but you know it's not and yeah we talked and you and you when you were describing shade on Sharp As a volume shooter  and what else does he do besides score some points sounds a lot like Jordan Poole to me  we'll see I I can't wait to see what Jordan Poole does he's either going to leave the league in scoring or is going to be a complete disaster he can do both he got it in him to do both how did you end up with any Ben Simmons  I he's kind of become a popular like write 11 12 round guy I don't think I got him and I may have gotten in some mocks by the time I started doing reel drafts he was going significantly earlier he generally around pick a hundred now sometimes even a Tad earlier than that when we did the Rotoworld mock I think we had  11 analysts and then one guy from Twitter just because you needed to fill out a spot and he took Ben Simmons at 72 or 73 and that was absurd but around Pickers kind of where he's going and generally I don't have bills that fit him great  so I haven't really ended up with Ben Simmons in many drafts but I think he's gonna be much better this year  I still don't know man I mean I'll take him I I'm going from never drafting Ben Simmons too okay fine I'll take a flyer on him in round 12 and we'll we'll see what happens I still don't trust him I still don't know still not really a Believer but it is it is interesting AI my thing I keep going back to is even if he does  come out and do and say all the right things he still can't shoot threes you still can't shoot free throws there's still holes in his game but he does have that defensive mindset when he wants to and he can rack up you know points three pounds and and assist like nobody's business so it'll be interesting to see what then does but  I  I would not be surprised if if we end up dropping him at some point this season I can see the I can see the wheels coming off and and things going sideways so  we shall find out  um what else

time to step up  to the challenge on Rival fantasy see you in the arena  um I'm gonna go check out rival fantasy I have not been there yet  sounds kind of fun no you got three bold predictions for me  whoo all right first one is gonna be Trey young top 10 nine cat player I think playing under Quinn Snyder's gonna work wonders for him gonna be much better than he was for Nate McMillan already talked about shooting more threes this year than he has over the past couple Seasons how he emphasized shooting more mid-range shots because they felt he was settling too much for deep threes but Quin Snyder wants him to shoot three so I think he's going to get back up probably at least a three per game if not set a new career high I think it's three point one I can easily see him getting over that and hopefully just coincides offense will help him get some better looks of field goal percentage go back up so I mean he was 11th I think was his best finish which was two seasons ago so I can see him getting back to that and maybe even a little bit better now that he has probably the best coach of his career Devin the cell top 50 in nine cat I think I'm not probably gonna take a top 50 but I think he can return that level value he's going to be probably the second best player in San Antonio obviously behind wemby who I think it would be kind of risky to say anybody's gonna be better than him this year because he's already looks so good but the cell is going to score hit threes he's pretty decent playmaker underrated playmaker can get defensive stats he just kind of improve the field goal percentage a little bit but I think having one be out there will help him with that  and a third bold prediction does it have to be a fantasy prediction or can it be  no  then I'll roll with another one that I had which was both Orlando and Indiana are playing in the postseason this year I think both teams have I don't remember the last time  they each had their individual posts of appearances but it's been a few years I think they might both end up being played in teams but I think both will be playing postseason basketball Indiana is going to be better just for young guys getting more experience adding Bruce Brown I think we talked about him going to be a really good  move to help them win games he's a winning player and then Orlando just has too much time I don't know if you saw Patrick Beverley on a podcast say oh it's I don't know why they have Paulo Bento and Franz Wagner or something ESPN's top 100 I don't know why they have them ranked so high if they have two players in the top 50 then why don't they win games it was just a dumb take because one that's a prediction for the season and two  like those guys are really really good they were a 500 team last year after a slow start so they're gonna be playing in the postseason this year they've way too much talent to not if they don't something is fundamentally wrong with that team there will be changes made quickly but I think both those teams will be playing in the postseason  yeah I agree with with you especially the Pacers I'm kind of all in on the Pacers this year I I actually am from Indianapolis I have a Pacers baseball hat that I actually probably should have put it on before we did this but I think they're going to be good I love their mix of veterans and youth and Tyreese Halliburton he's one of those guys like SGA and Anthony Edwards where it's just feels like he's about  he's about ready to take off to another level that we haven't seen yet and you picked him to lead the league in assists I'm with you on that I made a mistake on my pic I don't even know who got you again I oh Trey Yuen  Atlanta house right trade who you're you're bold predicting tray is going to be good so maybe maybe I'll be okay there but I just think Halliburton is is can't miss in the assists and I think the Pacers are not only gonna make the playoffs I think they're going to scare teams  in the East I think by the end of the season teams are not going to want to see the Pacers coming to their house  just there's gonna be a good team so know before we wrap it up here  you're not in the 3 0 t  so God we've talked about quite a bit today  I mean there's did Wendy get to you at 25 he did okay so what I got Victory women 25 and I was fired up about it and then I got the Aaron Fox on the way back and then we flip the third round yeah so I got to pick early in the third round and I got Austin Reeves  so I was pretty happy with the start of that team and my my phone lineup my starting lineup we started point guard shooting guard small forward power forward Center a card a forward and a utility player so my starting lineup for the 30 team leads the Aaron Fox Kobe White  Jaden Hardy of Dallas which  if Luca and Kyrie are gonna not play as much as people think they are Jaden Hardy could be kind of fun Austin Reeves women on a compass  some people think he's going to be in a candidate for Sixth Man of the Year in Brooklyn I'm not sure I'm one of those people I got your guys Zach Collins as my starting center which I'm pretty psyched about and then Payton Pritchard  red hot in the preseason is going to be my my utility guy so I feel better about this 30 30 man team then I have one that I've drafted in a long time  I know one year I had John Morant with my first pick and immediately got hurt went down with an ankle injury a couple years ago I had Zion he didn't play if your first round pick in the 300 like your season's over before it even started so none of that bares all that well for my man Victor woman Yama but I don't think there is a doctor a curse on these guys I think I just made some dumb picks those years  I've fixed it and got windy there you go  all right  all right well he's no Ruben you follow him on Twitter at know Ruben 22 I'm Steve Alexander Dr a um we I will see you guys on Thursday with Rick Cameron right back here at 11:00 on the road to wire fantasy Hoops
