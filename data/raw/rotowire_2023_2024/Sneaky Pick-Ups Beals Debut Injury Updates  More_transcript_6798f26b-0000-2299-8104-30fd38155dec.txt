hey everybody Welcome to the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast sponsored by Underdog rival fantasy and Vivid Seats  it's Thursday November 9th I'm doc  he's Rick  we've got a lot to talk about after 14 game night that saw several key players go down with injuries so  let's get to it rick  it's the OG that your service make comments guys get on in here make comments we'll be answering your questions later on it's Rick Hamlin it's Steve Alexander goats OG's reacting to a 14 game night in the NBA hole leak out so I go through all the news watch all the games I got you know this I go through the box scores and and stuff that just catches my eye I write I mean we're not gonna get to it all but we're gonna get to as much of it as we can but last night was one of the biggest nights of the entire year in the NBA 14 game let's start on Steve with Tyler hero blowing a tire ankle injury he's already talked about missing a couple of weeks Kyle Lowry took off last night 17 points 11 rebounds 9 assists throwback game for the future Hall of Famer and you know he's on waivers or was I haven't checked it this morning in the cam Dynasty the dynasty League that we're both in that I run I messed around with Lowery early it's this nickels and dimes right it's Five Points it's five rebounds and six assists one steal one three I can't work with that okay so now we get the spike game from Lowry in Heroes injury game so is this just a one game anomaly doctor a or are you believing in Kyle Lowry right now and are you going to pick him up  I don't know if it's a one game anomaly or not I'm not picking him up he's like 30 8 years old 36 50 months will be 50 60 and then last year he was he just was never reliable he was never around he was I just can't and that's 1711 and 9 is tempting but honestly there's another old guy rather pick up and his name is Reggie Jackson we'll talk about him later I'd rather pick up Duncan Robinson oh 35 minutes last night I would rather have one of those two guys then allowrie honestly very interesting I have my eye on Duncan Robinson out of the rotation last year played his way back into the rotation in the playoffs I've been coming off the bench playing about half the game making two plus threes per game you're not going to get other goodies he's a specialist right like Tim Hardaway Jr um if you need points in threes then go get him and if you know you need other stuff then he's not your guy um  I I agree with you Steve um there are guys and it will get to Reggie here and just a second um I would rather have Reggie Jackson and Kyle Lowry  I just I can't I can't get with it man I can't I feel like the next game for Kyle I was going to be 8 points five rebounds seven assists one steal and one three right like okay like I see the line but again that's that's not and you know the shooting is going to be low for Kyle Lowry he's not an efficiency guys gonna kill you with the field goal percentage I need to see more it's where I'm at so let's move on to Reggie Jackson here um like when I saw the sunlight I was like what did Jamal Murray is going to miss the rest of the month right I mean we've got three weeks left in this month like that was just weird to me we're not getting a he's gonna miss two to four weeks it's gonna miss the rest of this month um and that's a buzz kill that and and I don't know how much of it is bubble wrap how much of it is actually the guys dinged up here with this hamstring injury it's going to keep them out Reggie Jackson guys get him now he's rostered in 12% of Yahoo leaks 12% in this was his third start last night taking over for Jamal Murray he had 20 points 6 assists three threes last night in three starts for Murray he's gone 16 points 7 points and 20 points and seven of 16 on 3 switches I think 44% um so I think Reggie Jack he's not like a League winner pickup here Steve but over the next month or so I think you're going to get some goodies from Reggie so sing the people a song about the old head Reggie  Jackson  yeah you know crates and I were talking about this on Tuesday you're not going to get a lot of steals and get blocked it he sorta like Kyle Lowry the Juiced up Kyle Lowry I guess so it's not like he's gonna win your league for you and change change the game but the fact that you were talking about Jamal Murray is out through November didn't didn't what's his name have a song about that Rick the dude from the Fugees  I don't know really much about that I know you're going with my rose in November Rain that's right why Cliff White Cliff White Cliff John or gene or whatever he has uncle gone till November okay I guess that's your mom Murray's new theme song but and it is weird that would worded it as or Malone is like oh no he's out through November like that's the first time I've ever seen a coach using a month to say that a guy's I'm anyway we know that Reggie Jackson is the only guy they have to start a point guard when Jamal Murray's hurt and Reggie Jackson still has a chip on his shoulder still loves to play it NBA basketball still seems to have fire and passion I just like I just like that he gets out there and goes after it and I think I think he's gonna put up solid numbers until December I agree um you know you're looking at guys probably 15 points five assists 1.9 threes per game maybe a steal per game again it's not League winner stop but you can't leave them on waivers right now he's way better than um just chilling out there doing that on waivers and somebody else in your legal will get him so if you need a PG um go get them now there's another PG that has served on waivers and and let's weigh him against Kyle Lowry and Reggie Jackson his name is Skyler Maze and a lot of people doc watching the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Skyler frickin' maze who was that well he's an LSU guy he played there with I believe it was on that team with nas Reed and they had the little dude the point guard why is his name is escaping me is the steel guy can't make it in the league  I can't think of his name  but anyway um  Skylar Mays 18 points in 11 assists last night two steals taking over from Malcolm Brogden who was taking over for a scoot Henderson who was taking over for Anthony Simons guys the poor little back court this is a crazy glove of injury right now Simon's out for a long time he had surgery okay scoot Henderson out God knows how long and Brockton just picked up a hamstring last night we know how these injuries go so scholar means to the rescue they did not win the game because Jeremy Grant was missing shots in overtime he had a fabulous game but he missed some really important shots deep into overtime Malik monk went off late and sat got the win but but Skylar Mays here 18 and 11 two Steals and and it's giddy up Dr a like there's nobody in his way for playing time you know he was over talked with John C Phillips a lot Chauncey's getting him up to speed Chauncey he knows yolk this is my guy right now like like it or not g-league or not um this is the guy right now so give me your priority with Kyle Lowry Reggie Jackson and Skyler Maison waivers  um well that's that's interesting um  I think it depends on how deep your league is like 12 Team league I think these are maybe borderline like you got to have somebody on your roster that you want to drop to pick one of them up I need to see Skylar maze do that again before I'm going all in I think I think I trust Reggie and his minutes a little more than I do Skyler maze plus the Blazers stuff shade on Sharp who  is more of a two guard but they were playing him as one but all those injuries in Portland man like Malcolm Brogden a hamstring injury and his age and his injury history it's two or three weeks possibly you know on Broadway and Broadway was playing well so that's kind of sad amazes the the  outlier here because he's young and those other two guys are old so I am intrigued by Skylar maze I'm very intrigued by what he did last night I think Malik monk in the same game had a double-double right like 236 and 10 yeah he was fabulous so you had two guys go double double off the bench in the same game which hadn't been done since like Jordan and somebody like a long time ago so that was kind of cool but  I yeah I guess if I was gonna take a flyer on one of those three guys I'd probably start with Skylar maze just just because he's young and Portland so banged up Portland is nothing to play for they have no reason not to play Skylar maze 35 minutes tonight mace is the pickup here guys I go maze then Jackson then Lowry on waivers right now um he's a talented player I've seen him play I mean he doesn't suck right he's not just some ham and Egger like he he's got some go he's got some length to him um he was with the Hawks for a minute and and look I don't know all that much about this guy but he 18 and 11 last night and there's just nobody home all of these guys are out three uh one slash Twos for Portland OR out so um and I like the upside here I think there's more upside with Skylar Mays I was saying an MBA radio the other day doc I'm not a floor guy I'm a ceiling guy oh we were debating Bama versus Anthony Davis and if you're a floor guy then you want bam he's got a much higher floor than Davis is much our ceiling and I'm a ceiling guy I'm a swing for the fences guy I'm gonna grab the dice at the craps table and roll them down the table guy um and not like conservative in that way so I'd rather go for it with Skyler Mesa I think there's going to be more more popped there for you guys  um Devin the cell Steve as we talk about the developments of last night in a 14 game NBA slate it's Rick campus Steve Alexander the ogs here on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast what the hell were they doing with Devin Bissell last night was saying it until you guys been a rock star this year um injured comes back sooner than I thought frankly 12 minutes off the bench but now like pop said he was going to miss a while so that was erroneous um was he even ready to come back if you dipped his toe in the water for 12 minutes I just didn't get that Doc and you know I'm actually I'm watching the game last night right um the wind became at the Garden all this kind of the Olympic absolutely wet the bed in the first half last night and helped to stat line a little bit in the second half and I see Devin boccella out there right with the ice got the I don't know the bun on top and kind of the hair sticking out on top and I'm like it's like he's one of the only guys the league that has that look so I'm like  wait  is that Devin Michelle is he back did I miss this and so I see never sell up there and then this morning look at the Box we're already played 12 freaking minutes can you help me understand what Alice going on here  no no not really it's the new pop I guess the old pup would never put Devin good point for 12 minutes the new pop plays Wendy every night he plays Evansville when he shouldn't yeah I saw I saw a pregame Twitter was alive with Devin Michelle's going to warm up and see if he can go to Evans so warmed up and he is gonna go and then himself played 12 minutes of nothing a Spurs Spurs are bad I I don't know I don't know why they played him for 12 minutes Rick all right so he's got really nothing on that I just want to let you all know that I'm rocking some RotoWire swag today here shout out to Alan for sending me a swag bag I love a swag bag and it's very very nice stuff um we are the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Rick kamla and Steve Alexander let's go to Utah Steve this is the one we probably should have been talking about this  in the above point guard discussion right well let's add them to the mix here I'm taking George um the rookie out of Baylor for Utah first round pick up played well in the summer league Connor I and coming into the year I play had some moments in the preseason as well now there's a funny backstory to this um I just flip to Taylor Horton Tucker into a really premium asset in the cam Dynasty and I was joking with Doc on Twitter I actually tried to unload Taylor Horton Tucker I'm Steve Alexander and he was not having it okay and so I found a member of our league um and I mean it's not like I I stood or anything I gave up Clarkson with 33 last night but he's been awful this year like I did get out on the Clarkson thing man um and tht and a third round pick in next year's Dynasty draft which really isn't that valuable to be honest with you it's a 14 Team league and so you're getting super deep in the weeds in the third round of to me that's it's kind of a nothing type of pick anyway tht Clarkson and a third for OG on and Obi and why why am I going for OG well fantasy gold of course he's two and a half to three threes per game he's going to be one and a half to two steals per game he's a Camelot type of guy all right so in Doc was like you know giving me you know crap is up and I'm like you watch me turn tht into something and it's so funny doc that right after doing that trade boom THC out of the starting lineup and keonte George's in the starting lineup I did not know that I do not have a direct line to Will Hardy I didn't even check with David locked their great radio announced right to get some inside or  in I'm very very good at doing that you all reach up to Pete pranica and all all my play by play homies Jason Jackson down in Miami trying to get the inside scoop on these guys but on that time in worked out just great for your boy camp but talk to us about keyonte George he didn't really light up the box score last night doc yet nine assists but only 731 minutes so where would you stack keonte with Lowery with Jackson and with Skylar maze well it's interesting because  the guys in Australia  oh my gosh Josh  red wow why why are we talking about guys know what the fantasy guys in Australia they they were hyping up keynote George who are they and why do we care help me out are these the guys that will not leave that I that I bowed out of is that why are you bringing this up these guys screwed me out of wimpy and I left the league why are you bringing this up bro just because I'm wrote about it last week of my male but male bag for RotoWire everybody was asking questions about keyonte George and I'm like why is everybody asking about Keith George who was hyping this guy up I found out it was them our Twitter people I wrote about it I'm like I don't know you know I'm not ready to I'm not ready to pick him up and stash him just yet but at least I'm aware that he's eventually gonna take over for Taylor Horton Tucker and then I had a bunch of keynote questions in my mailbag question column that I wrote last night that is published today on to wire and it was about keyate George and tht and just like with your trade timing the timing of that was weird that tht got benched last night keonte George is starting like this is the moment we've been waiting for for two weeks like to me I think he's the priority pickup at all those guys and talk about I would go George then May's then Reggie and then Kyle Lowry at this point and maybe we got to put the kid Lonnie Walker in there somewhere too because cam Thomas got what we're gonna talk about that in a second but you know George the numbers haven't been that good this year I looked at the summer league numbers he must really pass the eye test I haven't spent that much time watching him but just based on the fact that Taylor Horton Tucker is the tht plug has already been pulled and it's still remember 8th yesterday yeah he'll take George is a guy one pick up so um I agree because there's more staying power here like this is probably his gig for the rest of the year and he's probably not going to be a shutdown guy either right because he's so young and needs so much development that he'll probably play after they shut down Clarkson and marking in in these guys like they did last year you talk sucks okay they just lost Kessler for a while they do I mean they're going nowhere they're going to be one of the worst teams in the league and and so keyonte George is gonna get a lot of playing time on a bad team efficiency gonna suck we know this okay um it wasn't great last night he was three of eight um but there's gonna be some raw numbers here and there's going to be minutes played I you know I like to see him in the 30s frankly because you've got sex and you've got THC they're not just gonna not play him you've got Clarkson as well so you've got four guards for those two guards spots but I would like to see them maybe get keonte to 30 drop THC known to 18 it's the backup Kris Dunn still kind of lurks in this in this mix as well but there's more upside with keyonte George Moore staying power so I agree with Steve I would put him above Skylar maze as you stack your prioritization with with the waiver wire I want to talk with you here Steve let's add another guy to the mix here Marcus Sasser the rookie for Detroit he's been really good now in three of the last four games you've got and Ivy who's Miss Steve I believe three games now with that illness and I'm wondering if there's not something more dramatic going on here because Jayden and ivy should not be coming off the bench behind Kelly and Hayes I think Monty Williams is not Beyond nuts for how he's doing his starting lineup um he is starting off our top so he's the homie for that but a boy on comes back and he moves Off the Bench I'm going to have a freak Show meltdown on NBA radio and perhaps here um  but but sasser's been really good 19227 and 26 has been his last four game Flo last night against Milwaukee at 5 serve via 26 points made 11 of 17 shots and was flexing and making fourth quarter plays at Milwaukee okay and a game where to trade had it and then let it go with the end so where you put Sasser in the mixer with George and with Skylar Maze and all these guys well before before the Maze and George  break you know breaks they caught last night Sasser was the guy I've been writing about it for the ESPN tip line and the risers and fallers like he's been playing well for you know a couple weeks now and he's still one of those guys that you don't really hear about because he's in Detroit you don't hear a lot about him because his name is Marcus Sasser and you just don't people don't know who that is but he's been putting up numbers for a couple weeks now and  I picked him up in a few League's I've used him in DFS several times I wish I would have used less Kelly Olynyk last night and more Marcus Sasser I'll tell you that  but yeah I like and in there is something weird going on with Jayden Ivy Jayden ivy should be one of the best offensive players on that team  and they they don't like him or they don't use him for whatever reason I'm with you like why is killing hey starting over dating Abby and getting all those minutes so I there there's something weird about Jade and Ivy in Detroit I will tell you exactly what's going on um Monty Williams is coaching a win tomorrow team to win today  that's what's going on here he does not have a win now team but he's coaching it like he's got a win now team okay remember we were starting Burks Alec Burks over Jade and Ivy  remember that happened this year like what are you doing bro and I like Alec Burks she's a bucket get her off the bench he could play for me but not over Jaden Ivy Jay and I said the top five picking his League he and Cade are the back of the future so we thought I think Monty Williams is nuts for not starting Jaden Ivy no nuts absolutely not and I would not even be mad at the Young fella if you were pissed and having conversations with this agent of to have conversations with the GM to go over the coaches said I would not even be mad at Jade tonight this is garbage in Monty Williams has been talking about you know there's no promised minutes here so what does that mean well maybe there's been a little um maybe Ivy's not playing quite as hard as he wants me here we go with Monty Williams and DeAndre and all that bull crap right and so a wash rinse repeat now with Monty Williams and Jaden and Ivy its trees me crazy um so I want to you up here doc on campus here and and you mentioned Lonnie Walker okay Lonnie Walker at 21 points and 28 minutes last night he was the player of the game okay I got the walk-off interview they beat the Clippers and the second game with Hardin was a whole Lonnie Walker thing okay and I'm not buying I'm super leaving Lonnie Walker on waivers because I think the next game will be three the next game will be eight the next game will be 19 and then the next game will be five and so I just don't trust Lonnie sell me on  I don't know that I'm gonna sell you on him I know we had a good game last night I know came Thomas went down we also know that Cameron Johnson still has yet to come back which that needs to happen for them and somebody else is out for the next two right whose the other one  um Nickelback's yeah Clarkston and Cameron Johnson are both out so we haven't even seen the real Nets maybe the camp Thomas Train was going to slow down at some point anyway but I am very upset as far as my 30 30 Team league goes  with losing Camp Thomas last night I left the arena on a some sort of device that allowed him to wheel himself around and Lonnie Walker had a good game I think Lonnie Walker is gonna play a lot I think he's gonna score some points but I think it's probably going to be some empty fantasy lines if I had to guess  so I I would consider picking up Lonnie Walker I don't think you need to break your neck to go out and try to try to make sure you get him he's sort of  a nice ad if he's sitting there kind of guy here's your deal ilani Walker guys he's a streamer okay it's a Thursday night we've got three games I need 15 points and two threes because I'm a vol accumulator like your Wise Guys Dock and cam like I'm not just sticking with my lineup you got to go and fetch all those little um cherries off the bottom of the tree it'll add another 60 points and another 12-32 total and probably put you over the top you know always gotta find those little holes to fill um and just keep hitting dudes with volume volume and so that's who we use for me Tuesday night light night maybe a four game Sunday there's not a lot going on and you need that guy to just give you a little bit more he's a streamer to me are you worried about lastly here as we go through last night and obviously there were a bunch of Great Performances but I mean we're fantasy are we go out into the weeds here and we're trying to help you off the waiver wire and how do you win in fantasy basketball league on the fringes okay and so that's where we're gonna live a lot  with these podcasts but um  Washington last night doc they got a win at Charlotte and west on sale um basically bench tyus Jones and Jordan Poole raising the minutes for July right and Landry Shaman and they were very good and they got the win one game thing or should we be worried about Ty's Jones and Jordan Poole here well there was a lot of talk about Jordan Poole winning the scoring title this year and how he was gonna get all the shots in Washington he's averaging like 17 points a game and and then last night happened and Ty's Jones  nice little fantasy point guard I think I don't  I I don't know that  that they can bench those guys I think if you I think if you trade Jordan Poole right now you're you're letting him go and his lowest point I don't think you want you want to mess with tyus Jones I don't think you need to trade him but Jordan pools been highly disappointing and I would be lying if I said I wasn't worried about it when I when I met a jersey with my friend Noah that he would score more points again than Luca that's not looking very good right now  you know I sat on NBA Radio on last year when he was with the dog says you get Jordan pulled the right scenario he's 25 points per game  that is not aged well for me it is not um you know he's 8 points below that right now in a spot Washington where he should be able to just do what he wants free Lancing you know it's maybe even just the number two to kuzma you should still be able to go out there and get I mean dang at least 22 points Jordan Poole has been a massive disappointment and he's getting out played by Denny of deja every night  jet I know Daddy is your guy Denny wasn't very good last night but for the whole year you are correct sir he's playing well hey Rick Underdog fantasy is the number one platform for NBA best ball and DFS player picking contest if you haven't tried

stuff it was pretty funny oh that's hilarious man shout out to Casey by the way um all right doc let's get into some players who have exceeded our expectations this year we'll go back and forth here give me one here it's cam it's doc on the road wire fantasy basketball podcast  you want me to give you one that's exceeded  that's exceeded and we can you know go back and forth here and play a little bit of tennis with this right you give one I'll give one we'll do it that way I'm gonna go well there's so many to choose from I'm gonna go with Chet homework looks real thin man whatever uh putting a big numbers Wendy's been fun too wimpy and chat I mean I think they are bringing us everything that we had hoped for when he was terrible last night but we've seen a game where he wasn't terrible at all and he had this crazy confidence thing going when he had that 38 and 10 against the Suns and it's just that is rookie NBA basketball they're gonna both guys gonna be a little up and down at times but I think if you drafted shed home we're in or you drafted Victor women you're pretty happy with with what you got  there's no question about it um especially in Dynasty League's man these guys look I am  I have an epiphany with the body thing I'm not worried about it um you know we think about guys like Sean Bradley and these you know it may he rest in peace right in these these guys that um you know their bodies just didn't hold up it was a different time I mean you had brutal out there you had Shack and Alonso in these guys right really yeah I mean there's there's no Shack there's no zone now right indeed is you know probably the the biggest dick is dude and he kind of sort of lives on the perimeter um you know Kevin Durant has been just fine right couldn't you know bench press 225 or whatever that  myth was and I mean he's the top 20 guy who's ever played the game um so I'm not worried about you I'm not worried about Wendy with the body I'm not it's it's that I and and you guys know this stuff Tim Duncan taught us this when Tim Duncan started taking off weight and every year towards industry come back to be skinnier and skinnier like my god dude eat a hamburger right well he didn't want to be carrying extra weight like Greg Oden right why did Greg Oden blow Tire after tire and then leave the league because you was too heavy okay so it being light and being Sleek is the way of today's game so I'm not worried about their Bots um shadowgreen 17 he is a guy from me too that's exceeded expectation guys I thought was gonna be good I really did I didn't see this oh 17 eight and three okay I might have seen that that doesn't Shock Me 2.5 blocks all right like that's pretty much in line with what I saw one steal per game okay cool 1.9 threes ding I did not see that done I did not see Chad Holmgren Rock in two threes a game on 56% from three he's 56% overall and 90% from the line he's not 5490 he's 55 55 90 through two plus weeks this has been crazy from chat um and look the debate for me is if I went back and redid the what is that the 2022 draft am I still taking Paulo Bank hero overhead Hall green I don't know it keeps me up at night I love Paula Bank Carroll I mean I freaking love him okay but he is not a combination of Rim protection in 3-point shooting which I'm absolutely obsessed with and shut it so that's a big toe and on my head that's tennis that's going on in my brain right now  let me give you a guy  doc as we talked about players who have exceeded our expectations here on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Jalen Johnson of your Atlanta Hawks Jaylon Johnson he just keeps getting better he's got three consecutive games with double-digit rebounds okay and I believe we're done with the saddiq Bey Jalen Johnson  starting lineup yo-yo thing I think we're done with that okay Jalen Johnson's going 14 points nine rebounds three assists 1.3 I didn't write it down here I think that steals I think he's just below a block per game he's right around a three per game um he's looking PJ Washington ish with better rebounding he's also looking John Collins ish you should be shooting 58% from the field 32% on threes and that will come up and he's 63% from the line so we've got some efficiency issues there but dang um is he the sleeper of the Year doc I mean he kind of is for me like I mean he's been um he was a sort of pre-season let's see where we're going with this and now I mean I can't get him out of my lineup in the cam Dynasty so Jalen Johnson has a greatly exceeded my expectations me too and any passes the eye tests like when you watch the Hawks play he looks like the best player on the court not named John trade and and he's running the floor so much like you compare them to to those big guys what's his face they get John Collins PJ Washington and PJ Washington those are like big guys they don't run the floor like Jalen Johnson does right Jalen Johnson is trailing behind Trey and Deontay and their feeding him and these lobs and alleys and he's he's having a nightly dunk show for us on Valley Sports and  if saddiq Bey wasn't around right now Jaylen Johnson would be talked about all over the league but he just  he's not getting quite enough minutes to take that next step but I think they're coming so I love Jalen Johnson and he's somebody I didn't draft in a single league but as soon as I started watching the Hawks play real games this year I was like this guy's real he's gonna be awesome  all right so we're both digging what we're seeing from Jalen Johnson give the people here on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Steve Alexander another player who's exceeded your expectations  I'm going to do that but first I'm going to tell you about rival fantasy Lebron vs

Schroder  my guy we saw this coming into the season when  Fred Van Fleet went to Houston you take a look at Toronto's depth chart and like who is going to play point guard for this team and there was only one name there and it's Dennis Schroder he has been awesome for them and he's been awesome for Fantasy the numbers have not gone away he's might even be getting better as the season advances and I'm not gonna say it's a huge shocker a huge surprise but he's playing better than it I thought he would and I thought he was gonna play well so he's been pretty awesome  sure is on my list as well Sixth and assists in the NBA at 8.4 per game 17 3 and 8 basically is his three cat line 1.1 steals two threes he's been fabulous and he's not been an efficiency guy every year of his career he has been this year 47 field 40 from 3 and he's been absolutely fantastic doc we got some people in here that want to bounce questions off of us so let's feel some of these right now here which one you want to do I'm throwing up on the screen um Ian Solace here on  thoughts on Jalen green and Scoot Henderson and that was pretty slick what you did right there I like that a lot um so on scoot I mean he's hurt right I mean you just put him on ill and he's gonna come back and um you think I mean I guess you know you think of scoot now with Simon's out and Brockton on pop the hamstring last night how long is he going to be out so scoot maybe really ready for takeoff when he comes back from that ankle whenever that is now in terms of who is the other player that he Jalen green okay Jalen green is a buzzkill and fantasy and last night he was not all right Lakers were in town he had 28/7 and 3 made 11 to 15 shots in 21 minutes but but therein lies the truth because he only took 15 shots on a heater night and he only played 21 minutes now it was a blowout the Houston starters all played in the 20s last night but um you looked at coming into last night's game all five starters were all very good we're averaging between 14 and 18 points it's a clear a setup by email udoka here we are not you know here to have one guy scored 25 a game we are here to collectively do this have everybody eat and when everybody eats everybody defense and everybody does the dirty work and all the little things that you know that players get entitled about when they're not getting shots well if you're eating your defending and so I think that's the formula here so doc whereas we might have thought the Jalen was going to go you know from 20 to 22 to 24 or 5 this year he's at like 19 right now and I don't see a whole lot of upside here this isn't like a slow start and he's gonna get it cooking know you've got books she got bam bleach you got your Barry Smith and you got Shen goon I just think there's too many miles to feed here  yeah and Dillon Brooks and until the last game was putting up huge numbers another surprise he guy and you know I think we all wondered our van Lee and and Dillon Brooks gonna work I apparently it does and it's bad news for Jaylon green like Jalen green is not on an island by himself allowed to take as many shots as he wants like you said they're spreading the ball around trying to play Team Basketball trying to make everybody trying to turn that thing into a true team and and that's bad news for Jalen green I rather he was on an island and allowed to just do whatever he wants but it's not the case  it's not the case so so let's go to another question here by Guilford Wong trade pool for Beale oh man  uh can I happen didn't I just happen in real life it kind of did I think Chris Paul was involved there somewhere to uh  I don't want to either  there I I don't want either if  I am so out on Bradley Beal like I couldn't be more out  like I'm out on Bradley be like I'm out on Kyrie um who else Brandon Ingram of D'Angelo Russell Like These are not my guy James Harden these are not my guys okay ironically I have hard and be on my team in Camden Dynasty my favorite team of all my teams and  it is what it is I mean they I tried to trade deal I literally I canvassed the entirely from Bradley Beal and I didn't not ask for a lot in return for Bradley Beal crickets man every your trade has been declined your trade has been declined it's like okay I guess I'm just stuck with Bradley Beal here right 1344 last night in 24 minutes on so you know how this is gonna go he's not gonna play back to back so my God the horror um minutes restriction I'm so done with Bradley Beal dude if I had to pick I would take Jordan Poole just because I'm more done with deal than I am with pool I'm exactly the same I'm not I have not been a beagle guy ever and I call my my golf buddy John Utterback sometimes I call him Johnny one putt  and I like to call Brad Bradley one leg it's just he's done I think he's cooked I think Jordan Poole right now I don't know that you want to trade right now because I feel like you're selling low  on Jordan Poole Poole is he's gotta get better than he's been so I think Rick and I are both in agreement we are not trading Jordan Poole for Bradley  Guilford long also asked us um should we be trading Randall question mark he's shooting his horrific ah look Julius Randle the last couple of games has been very very good last night he was awesome 2316 and 5 I'm a Julius Randle guy I know there's gonna be bad nights and he's gonna have bad decision making the leads to Nick losses but damn he's a 25 10 and 5 guy and there are like five of them in the NBA right now so I'm a Julius Randle guy hanging in there with him I would not trade him doc about you I mean you can't shoot it this poorly all year right he's gonna he's gonna be better I think again for trading Randall right now you're you're selling low and that's not what you want to do in the stock market or in fantasy sports you want to you want to sell high so I don't think it's a great time to be to be trading Julius Randle and Rick if you are looking for another outstanding performer that's exceeded expectations this year I'm going to throw I was just going I was stealing all the guys off your list I'm gonna throw out burning out there because alpie has been pretty awesome he's out on your list too all right no he's he's honestly kind of doing what I thought he was gonna do I mean he's been fabulous but this is kind of what I saw write about 17 points about eight boards about four assists like he's he's in Steve this is interesting because this goes back to my scouting of shen in the pre-draw process he  reminded me of De Montes sabonis his great hands great footwork he's really smart and crafty and clever in the paint and around the rim he's a good playmaker you can run offense through him and I saw all of this looking at film of him on playing for I be shocked or whatever damn team he was on but he gave me some bonus Vibes in the pre-drive process and is he giving you some bonus Vibes when you watch him go and when you look at his stat line yes and he's he's gotten increasingly better with each season also and like it's noticeable from season one to Season Two Season three I drafted him I drafted a lot of shares of shengwen so I thought it was gonna happen and I'm just glad that he's living up to the hype like he's certainly doing everything we could have asked for in a little bit more I'd say Rick

about out of time here Guilford Wong DOCSIS thanks Doc thanks Rick fantasy ogs miss your show on NBA TV Guilford thank you for that God bless you man I appreciate that um I want to talk you know obviously here about some players who have fallen short of our expectations and I want to merge it with a question here from I believe it's Fork three um and look at me I just popped it up oh you said that sometimes I get this technology thing right um he says what do you guys think about Josh Gideon Jabari Smith in nine cat what do you think is expected so um for Jabari Smith again it's back to the jail and I mean are we happy with Fred Van believe numbers I promise you been Fleet managers are not happy with his numbers right again we're spreading the wealth in Houston now so what you're getting from Girardi Smith is what you're going to get from Jabari Smith and that was my  expectation coming into the yard I did not see a popular from Jabari now Josh giddey Doc is a player maybe the number one player for me who is falling short of my expectations his points are down from 16.6 to 12.1 7.9 rebounds to five point nine six point two assists to 4.5 48% filled down to 40 33 from three down to 24% from three and minutes have gone from 31 to 28 because he's playing like such garbage that Mark Daniel is going with some other guys now okay Josh Gideon has been a nightmare from my advantage point and I I'm not invested in him because I just saw too many dudes Jalen Williams Chad SGA Dort know too many guys I didn't see a massive statistical Year from getting on who last year was 16/8 and 6 like a Ben Simmons really fat stat line we're not getting that we're getting 126 and 5 right now either  well I think we were I was worried about Jalen Williams getting enough run this year that has not been a problem Jalen looks looks pretty awesome and and I think the fact that Jalen is playing well Chet's Plainwell Lou Dort  we haven't talked about Lou Dorman but I mean out of all the guys we've talked about today he's the one I've been picking up off the waiver wire in most League's 36 minutes last night three triples two steals three blocks a big minutes every night he had a hip injury he played through it and then there's giddy you know those other starters are all getting 30 plus minutes a night giddy's getting got 25 shot for 11  kind of filled the stat sheet a little bit but yeah he's been he's been weird and he's you know thing is the thunder are five and three the Thunder are nobody is one gonna want to see that team in the playoffs right no one and  giddy knows that he doesn't need to have the ball in his hands all the time to be great on that team to be their General and just kind of hold things down why SGA scoring 40 and I get into the bucket whenever he wants and Jalen Williams and Chad and Dort are firing up like there's so many weapons on that team getting is going to be more like a true point guard that just kind of runs the offense and stands back and watches it all happen so I I don't think he's going to be a focal point of their their offensive training  for here I gave before we get out of here you want to give him a player that's falling short of expectations tell them where to read your stop whatever the floor is yours brother I'll be riding my mail bags should be up on RotoWire right now thanks for all the questions on Twitter and then I've got my risers and followers hitting ESPN tomorrow that's that's been a big column over there at ESPN fantasy so if you play Fancy who's add ESPN it should show up right right in your right in your app whatever tomorrow and then last night was crazy man so many games Giannis got ejected did you see the honest ejection oh my God I gotta dig into that a little bit I saw that it was pretty garbage from what I saw I got I got a look I of course Angus got a tech last night for hanging on the rim when Horford hit him in the head from behind on the dunk attempt it's like he's not showing anybody up he's trying not to die okay so you just hit a nerve with me dude and I saw jaxson Hayes the other night but the Lakers now he did do a pull-up on the rim okay but he also had a guy around him I'm like Let It Go why are we talking these guys for that in honest stared down the dude for like a second and a half like he was like in the turn around and walk away and they're like bam he was second Tech he's gone he the people that are paying money to go watch Giannis play and spending a thousand dollars and taking their kid down there for that to happen man it's it's BS and it needs to stop with that Rick are you done you have anything you need to plug hype we're out you got your you got  your swag your RotoWire swag on yes sir I'll be on NBA Radio later today at 2:00
