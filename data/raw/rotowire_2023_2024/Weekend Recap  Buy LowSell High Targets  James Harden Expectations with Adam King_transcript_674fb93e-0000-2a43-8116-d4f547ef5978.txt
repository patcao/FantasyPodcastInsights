welcome into a Monday edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Nick Whalen joined as I am every Monday by Alex Peru so we get a special guest on the Pod those of you listening along watching live on Twitter on YouTube you can see him right here he is out of King he's been writing for Road a wire for a long long time I do it a ton of work for us over the years and Adam you are currently in the midst of your trip over to the United States from Australia so to tell us about you know the games that you've already been to I know you're hit as many NBA games as you can what else is on the schedule stand out what kind of start there and then moving to some of our biggest takeaways from the weekend  yeah no good to be here it's good that we can Line Up Normally there's a time difference which is an issue so not at the moment what games we've been to we've been to a couple of pelicans games a Celtic game a Paces game and we've got two more Paces going to go before we head home stand out for me ah I think we're we were lucky enough when we went to the Pelicans games we were able to get VIP pregame tickets so we were able to get down right next to the court and watch the shoot around for me it was how big some players are and how small some players are so CJ McCollum was very small he was a lot smaller than I thought Mitchell Robinson is very big stood next to him and and he sort of towered over me  the Celtics just I think for me that the what stands out is the different environments the different courts the different crowds like New Orleans very different to Boston and then Boston very different to Indiana as well the Boston crowd is just they're ready for a championship this year it's the very excited we actually saw the Pacers game in Indiana in Boston where Boston won by 50 so it wasn't a close game but seeing Sam Houser and Payton Pritchard go off in the fourth quarter the crowd was just as loud for that as they were for this the start of the game so yeah look at it's been a really fun trip other than getting sick but that usually happens when you travel so we're off to the webinar again tonight which should be fun nice very nice Spurs are in action what do they have tonight oh they're at Indiana okay there we go yes I've always liked when I look at my scoreboard at my scroll to the bottom because I feel like they play late games but they are on the road at Indy where were you over the weekend did you catch any of the in season tournament games on Friday  no so we just missed those we missed the the Indiana in season game by one night so yeah they played the  who did that kind of remember who they played in that first in season game but we caught them on the night  yeah they might have we caught them the night after so yeah we we saw the  Hornets game that was very close  and yes I didn't get to see any of those wild caught designs  we met you CJ McCollum he said he saw him in person down into warlands got the deuce that he's dealing with a collapsed lung this is now the second time over the last few years that we call them as dealt with this I am yet to really see anything definitive as far as how long he could miss you know December of 2021 was the last time this happened and he missed about a month and a half should be in evaluation you know the next day or so that will provide us some more information on McCallum but guys should we be bracing for you know a four to six at least week absence here I will I will say you know McCollum missed this is from Matt Smith on Twitter who I think he's a basketball monster guy last time McCollum had a collapsed along he missed 18 games so like over a month yeah two other players who had collapsed lungs were Terrence Jones and Gerald Wallace and they missed six and seven games so I think you know if you're a fantasy manager I think you have to be ready for a College of Business bare minimum two weeks and since it's like a recurring issue for him I you just can't be surprised if it's a month or more but I it's probably something that I imagine and ends up being um probably week to week like you may not know on Monday if he's playing on playing Friday like it may have to kind of take it day by day or something  what's your level of interest in Dyson Daniels is that the is that the obvious pivot you know we could see a little more Jordan Hawkins yeah maybe Kyrie Lewis their first round pick from a few years ago who got hurt but I think I said Daniels is the the most obvious still in for the next couple of weeks we do you kind of forgets YouTube a call is Century the full-time point guard and what are the only true point guards on this roster so is that somebody you were grabbing off waivers over the weekend well what do you think what yeah look I I actually put in a bid for him last night in the industry pickup league and he ended up going to  Mitch Casey for 90 dollars  out of 1000 Dollar budget so so Mitch paid up and yeah I think it's nice and Daniel's I think we've seen enough from Hawkins and Matt Ryan we know who they are they're not really ready I don't think I think Ingram's gonna handle the ball a lot more without my column so yeah I think Daniel's is the one if you if you want to take a flyer on someone as long as you don't need  sort of guaranteed scoring he's gonna he's gonna sort of in a cross a few categories on most nights I think guys we saw the Memphis Grizzlies last night finally pick up their first win of the season they Avenged a loss to Portland on Friday getting the 112 100 Victory it's so far for Memphis it's kind of been a two-man show with Jared Jackson with Bane and we knew that would be the case to some degree you know Marcus Smart is this has some ups and some Downs as well has been a great start for him yeah I watched this Memphis team and you know we could talk about some of the fantasy ramifications in a moment but it feels to be like a team that's relying on a bunch of guys who if they're your seventh eighth ninth band you feel pretty good but if you're asking Zyra Williams to to be your third or fourth minute get her like that's gonna be a little bit of a problem like how could you guys about this Grizzlies team  I mean I was pretty concerned to start the year I was surprised how many people picked their over you know on the win totals although that was before Stephen Adams got her and I think some of those people maybe changed their tooth because the Morant Steven Adams thing was such a such a crucial part of the offense but you said it I mean there's just you know Bane Triple J Marcus Smart like those are really the only guys on this team that I have any confidence in even Tillman is pretty up and down um you know they signed Beyond bow desire Williams looks interesting but he wasn't even in the rotation last year like everybody else on this team it's just they won't even be like guaranteed rotation players on some you know Championship contenders so I'm definitely concerned  yeah I was pretty concerned as well Steven Adams is pretty important to this team so not having him there and then you remember Brandon Clark isn't there as well so he would be playing big minutes if he was there now and he's somewhat trustworthy so yeah I was pretty concerned and I haven't seen anything thus far I mean they won last night but it was against Portland how many games are they going to win this season not any I don't think so yeah worrying times I think in Memphis it could be worrying times for the Orlando Magic as well we're off to pretty good start we can equivalent about some of the teams that they beat but they're forward to so far picked up a nice win over the LA Lakers over the weekend but guys we are we are going down this path once again with Wendell Carter it's always one step forward two steps back he's out now for at least the next three weeks due to a fracture on a finger in his left hand so probably won't see Wendell Carter until at or around Thanksgiving Alex we saw some monster bids come in can cry it's our guy adding Goga toze for 53 dollars in the road to wire stake League last night let's talk about 100 by the way it's not the industry pick up that and I went to the settings page to double check that the budget was 100 yeah because that had a few kkc it's all about 1000 so it's like okay look I mean I forgot a bid for Beyonce I think I somewhere in like the 15.00 range I don't quite remember I mean he's someone that I think like the Casual fan is no idea who he is people who  have played fantasy for the past half decade know that he's like a per minute guy yeah people who've ever written player notes have no idea because he's been banged up for two and a half straight years exactly and hit look he had a nice game and if he continues to play 26 like basically of him and Wagner  split playing time going forward at the five I think they can both be fantasy viable in 12 teams maybe more so on four game weeks because potassium is not going to do 10 10 5 and 2 every single game but what do you think about I mean they also have Mark Hill fultz is doing with the knee injury too right now is has been out past what two games  yeah full is already out for he's been ruled out for tonight so that'll be his third it does sound like he was able to go through through some of the pregame stuff so he's getting closer so I'm hoping it's only another one of two games because I've got him in a lot of teams yeah in terms of that Senate position I think  both players probably have value at the moment it'll depend a little bit on the matchup but today I'll be used a little bit more if there again you're more traditional beak Center whereas the ability to stretch the floor and switch out a little bit so I didn't get anywhere but I managed to get Mo vagina for three dollars so while everyone went on but Dad say I just went three dollars on Vagner and he only played about 20 minutes I think so I'm hoping that that could maybe creep up to 25 in some matchups but we'll see but yeah Wendell Carter I'm pretty glad I didn't draft him anyway well I think everybody's rushing out to get potassium because he had five blocks the other night against the Lakers and I get it you know he also had 10 points 10 rebounds there's just not a lot of evidence to suggest that yeah that's anything sustainable and you know if you're picking them up and it's not like window Carter tours ACL here it's like he could be back in the next three weeks you know nothing against our guy Uncle Ken Crites love the death I don't know if I'd want to you know spend half of my fab Budget on somebody who might only be viable for a few weeks and it's like to have some down games in there I mean he looked back at last season yeah how many games did he play well even just say 20 plus minutes he had eight games where he played 20 plus minutes in those games you have seven points eight rebounds 1.3 blocks and I don't think this is a situation you know where he's playing 30 to 35 minutes like you said at him I you know if it's would you rather spend 40 to 50 dollars for today or three to five dollars for for both Ogden to be that's a pretty easy decision  yeah and I think I think one thing about oh one thing about Wagner too in this game Wagner at five fouls in this game against the Lakers so he was a bit of foul trouble he also took a season High ten shots from the Fielding is 19 minutes and he can play some forward as well so you know if for whatever reason they kind of goes small Vagner might be a better option there so yeah whoever you got I want to feel bad about it well what kind of see how it develops though I've got a question in the chat for our guy Jordy who says is a time to drop Jeremy Sohan he is in a dynasty leak so keep that in mind and Dynasty I'm willing to to see this out you know if anything in that I would try to trade him as opposed to just straight up dropping him in a dynasty league but I think we can apply this to redraft as well I mean if you're I stayed away from so hard for the most part so I don't I don't have a lot of exposure to him I haven't really had to deal with this just really invest Ball but if you have him right now in a redraft league or are you thinking about cutting bait  we think I like I'm okay holding him I've got him in two one or two legs and I'm really I mean head-to-head legs so in the teams that I've got him on I really just need him to get some assists some rebounds not kill my free throw percentage some defensive stats so it wasn't relying in for points or threes or anything like that so I think depending on your build I think he's okay to hold because I think the Spurs  are invested in him one way or the other whether it's at they start as they're starting point guard long term or this is a short term thing they don't need a position where they will need to give up on this idea of him as a point guard after two weeks I think they they can roll with this for a month two months even if it's not working Devon vessel is out at the moment as well with a groin I think groin thing so that probably gives him a bit more opportunity there so I'm okay hold him I wouldn't just drop him as he said you could maybe look to trade him but I wouldn't just be dropping him yet  yeah I don't think there's a reason to drop him and in Dynasty leagues because someone's going to be high on him so you you're probably gonna be able to give a trade like Nick said and even as I mean  it's hard to say whether or not he's playing poorly I mean 96 and 5 with a steal and 27 minutes like that's not bad I think the upside here is like he's only 20 years old and he fits next to when Benn Jama so if you're a dynasty League those two things are going in your favor and even even if you think he's playing poorly still ranked 100 50th like he's not he's not killing you he's still a four game week guys so um yeah I would definitely hang on to a more or look to move it back anything  got a question or potentially a statement from from Adrian here it reads as a statement I assume it's a question should you try to buy low on Julius Randle who is off to just a disastrous start to the year it's kind of healing LaBella ball or the guys that are primarily responsible for killing field goal percentage categories right now at least lamelo got on track last night gave you 30 10 and 10 Julius Randle through six games guys 13.7 points per game 27% from the field 22% from three the free throw shooting that's also been bad 61% on the year he's never been a great free throw shooter but he's been you know at least kind of mid to high 70s he's had a couple 80 plus seasons in his career one what is going out with Julius Randle and two Alex are you willing to buy low if somebody offers him up  so he had offseason ankles surgery and so I assume he basically did nothing you know basketball wives over the off-season I think that's some of it because Randall you know Randall's not really like a good natural shooter he kind of has worked his way into becoming a better shooter and I think taking it whole off-season offer him as is probably bad on that front I would buy low I mean this is someone who basically has a fantasy floor when he's been right you know basically with New York of like I don't know six seventh round and the good news here is he's still taking basically the same amount of shots like his usage hasn't really decreased at all is a sister actually up compared to last season so yeah I mean if I can trade someone who who I would project as like the like a top 90 or player you know over the rest of the season and I can get Randall and return I think I would do that  yeah yeah look up probably about as low as anyone on to but I still think this is a good Buy Low opportunity because as you said he's gonna be better than this he's shooting I think I saw something the other day this is the worst start to a season in history in shape the field goal was sending each so he'll be better I look I saw him in the Walmart when they played the Pelicans and he just wasn't right like you could tell he hadn't  he wasn't where the other guys were in turns of shots falling just read them that sort of thing so I think he'll be better I did read I think this morning that there is possibly some conjecture within the next locker room about their Direction and their style of play and that sort of thing which doesn't really come as a surprise to me but  I'd certainly Buy Low if you could if you can find a manager who's pretty frustrated and just willing to give him up for anything then you might as well throw an offer out there  okay can't get any worse is the one thing I would say I mean it truly can't get worse I think there has to get better and if you've whether the storm so far I mean but Julius Randle he's that he hasn't been on your bench right you've been thinking the last two weeks it's gonna get better it will so I I wouldn't say I go out of my way to buy low but if you if you could do it without giving up too much I think I think you know if you're not the one that's been hard you know and you're on your roster for the last two weeks by this you have to assume that he's going to Trend upward let's say we got a few more good questions in the chat here you know a lot of people have asked us about miles Bridges I have no information I have no idea nobody really seems to know I my guess is that he plays at some point you know unless Charlotte you know kind of gets it for better for worse pressured ended up playing game by I think that's one of the holdups right now but it seems the way that Charlotte is operated that unless he is suspended by the NBA or you know not allowed to participate NBA games legally I think they're going to pursue you know him coming back at some point especially if they continue to struggle I mean they it no doubt makes them a better basketball team you know there are a ton of things going on off the court and he's I think proven himself to to not be anything close to a model citizen but if we're just asking for Fantasy Basketball purposes I don't know what he's coming back but I'd be pretty surprised if he doesn't play at all this year  yeah that was actually I think news actually came out the other day that unless anything changes between now and when he's 10 games suspension is up whether that's just an extra suspension or  any additional news So based on what we know right now expectations are that he will play in that 11th game I'm not sure what the date is but that that's what I read and I've heard of other few animals talking about that and saying so I've got him on a couple of my injured in my injured slots and I'm just gonna hold say what happens  yeah I again not a whole lot to say they're like you said he is technically eligible you know once that 10th game is served I think at that point it's just you know it's almost reminiscent of the Sean Watson situation in the NFL at some point where it's like is the organization willing to stomach some negative PR if they are then they probably throw it out there and you know in their mind hope that it blows over but yeah I think I would if you're holding them for now probably do it for another week I don't think Now's the Time to cut bait you'll see where see where we get at that 10 game Mark and then you could go from there got a couple questions guys about Camp Thomas you know Adrian asking basically we think Camp Thomas could keep this up should we look to trade him we had another question of you know if we do want to trade Camp Thomas who are the type of players that you could Target that that have the same ceiling but first about I want to get your take on Camp Thomas and whether or not he could keep this up because it does feel like whatever he's been granted this opportunity in the past you know whether it's been this year or kind of in random one off Situation's last season you know he's a free ticket to 25 plus points whatever he gets the minutes  yeah he's a you know some of this is that cam Johnson's been out  you know I don't I don't think his minutes or his workload has a lot to do with like the clocks unless you think like you know classes gonna start playing 30 minutes and then finally Smith gets like shifted down and it just keeps everyone keeps sliding down and then and then Thomas gets squeezed but I don't really think that's gonna happen I mean this this Nets team is just really it's not that good they don't have Championship aspirations they don't I you don't Envision them winning the Eastern Conference or anything like that so for them like they have this 22 year old guy who clearly is one of the most like just talented pure scorers in the league you gotta you gotta look and play a little bit so like I will he continue to play 33 minutes a game and averaged 26 points I don't think so but it's hard for me to imagine even when cam Johnson comes back Thomas not seeing 20 minutes game but I think this is about as high as a stock will be this season if you're if you're short of asking like is this a sell High Point  yeah and you know he's a top 40 guy and wrote a leak so far it's the points that are pretty much single-handedly doing that I mean he's been 85% of the line on high volume so that helps too but you know he's not a great rebounder he goes out of his way to not pass you know maybe gets you a steal per game so I think there is still there's still a little bit of a disconnect as far as you know how effective he's been real life versus fantasy but the second part of the question yeah do you any kind of demographic type of player come to mind as far as who you would Target if you if you're trying to sell high on campus maybe somebody in your league needs to help in points needs to help in free throw percentage you know I'm kind of looking at I think I mean you got a name I was having some internet connection issues okay I'll lead into it and then we when Arab goes back I'll let him take it but this this could be your classic you like you hey could you target Julius Randle like you know you could just say yeah  I think I think you look to sell high on Thomas for a guy who's underperforming that you know is like a top 50 or a top 60 player assuming they're shooting gets back on track I think that's kind of what you're looking at yeah you are you back with us now Adam  oh no I might be do you have me all right we're back we're back all right so do you have any players in mind who you know if you're let's say you're trying to sell Camp Thomas somebody you're targeting I'm thinking you know DeMar DeRozan somebody like that I mean can you can you aim that higher do you have to go to your lower  I think we might have lost out I mean you have to find a manager who's willing  yeah okay keep calling dude I think they're about to be like yeah I think there's a big delay hang on I don't know  yeah  okay I would try to try to just back out back back come back into the stream but Alex yeah nonetheless we will we'll continue to run through a few players here it's so tough because we're still we're still early enough on that you know some teams have only played five games and you know like the overall season log fantasy rankings aren't really you know reminiscent of what to expect going forward I I think I'm aiming you know you're looking for I think somebody who you project to finish what somewhere between 40th and 60th 40th and 70th in total value like you're not you're not get a pry away Damian Lillard for cam Thomas obviously but I think you find a veteran maybe a veteran who's off to a slightly slow start and you go from there  yeah and look I mean what what cam Tomas is doing for you and your families almost exclusively points like that's what he's getting used can you points and I guess free throw percentage he's a good free throw Sherry he takes a lot of them  but you know points are relatively easy to find on the wire you can stream guys in on four game weeks what's tougher to find is like high level assist guys yeah um so if you could trade Camp Thomas for someone who's putting up great assist numbers assuming you need assists if it's your build whatever it is I think that's the kind of move that that I'd be looking to make I've got a question from Marco on Jalen green he's so frustrating to have yes he is he is very frustrating to have I don't really have a lot of jail green and redraft I got them in our our staff keeper League you know took some flyers on him and best ball  I love the idea of jail green I still do think long-term it's it should work out I just I think him Landing in Houston and the situation that Houston's in now which is in my opinion in a roundabout way worse you know now we just compete with Dillon Brooks and Fred Van Vleet for touches I just think he's in a really bad spot developmentally and I don't like how much I'm seeing someone like Nick Young Jordan Poole shot selection from jail green this season like he doesn't he's too good to be playing like that and I think the the lack of discipline and you know just the the fact that Houston is trying to simultaneously develop like five players 22 and under at the same time it's hurting not only him but it's hurting all  yeah I I wrote about Jalen green and it an article that was sort of like do you panic about these specific players who are who are underperforming and I didn't quite like have the panic button push for Jalen green but I tried to lay it out like there is not a lot of positive indicators right now it's not like he's just shooting badly his usage rate is down if you use the usage rate that also accounts for assists which is on cleaning the glass last year he was at 28 this year he's at 26 so he's getting fewer touches he's not passing as much yes his field goal percentage is down but really not that much same with this free throw Etc like he's not improved on defense he just he just kind of just the guy he's been since his rookie year um and do you roster that guy in fantasy I can't blame you because you can still put them in on 4 game weeks and hope that he kind of bounces back sooner than later or I should just say improves in general but I would not be married to the idea of like rostering Jalen green especially in like a 10 team category League  all right interesting one here Alex from the Taylor Made Clan you know from one golfer doing other I appreciate the the user name here got offered Zach LaVine for Pascal siakam ten team points League do I take it or do we see Pascal siakam turning things around as we we welcome Adam King back to the mix here Alex I am dealing with the Pascal caca was in a number of leaks right now had that big game I believe it was against Milwaukee last week but other than that man it just it feels like he's like switch bodies with Scotty Bartz he's already have like four disaster games including his worst game of the year against the San Antonio Spurs last night 8.6 rebounds five assists  I like like Julius Randle I do think she outcome gets a turn around the track record certainly suggest you will but even if she Aqua was just off to an average starting I think you know siaka versus Levin is an interesting one to talk about  if you have us Adam do you want to take this one  I I've got you have you got me okay you're got you bye okay all right who would I rather oh it's actually a tough one  yes look at pretty bad the Raptors have looked pretty bad so  I probably take the vein  in a points lie it's pretty close to me I do think as you said siakam will get better but I think I think Levine  role just what he does is pretty much guaranteed every night so  I'd probably lean Levine slightly but it's pretty close for me  yeah I I kind of feel the same way actually I mean I was I have to admit I was big on siakam this draft season you know I thought he was definitely a third round guy like if he was there for me I was almost never letting him get past I thought with the with the absence of Fred Van Vleet you know that he would really stop up more into a number one one role but like like Nick mentioned it's the Scotty Barn Show and even the youngest Schroeder show who's been playing excellent for them and see akam  yes he's not shooting very well okay he's used to Drake is down 7% that is massive that's a massive decrease you went from 29 to 22 right now this season and Levine is back up at 28 and when the difference is that big and use it honestly I just want to lean on the guy that's that's a bigger part of the offense right now that's Levine and Levine is I not shooting that while either as a sister relatively low neither of these guys are like pure Specialists either it's not like siakam has some low usage rate but he's a block Specialist or something no it's like these guys are both they need touches so I would I would lean on the on the Levine because I think they both Levine probably has a higher ceiling this year honestly at this point yeah I've been very concerned with what I've seen from siakam and this is a trade that I may have to be seeking out myself at some point speaking of the Raptors is Scotty Barnes a big sell High asks Raya if so who do you think you can get for them or do we just hold Alex what do you think about this one I'm looking at Scotty Barnes he is 10th in eighth category per game value so far so certainly not somebody that you're you know in a hurry offload with how well he's playing and it with each passing game I feel like I'd be less and less inclined to deal him but what's a you  yeah with with these sorts of questions you have to ask yourself what what is sustainable and what is not sustainable most of the time this comes down points wise this comes down to volume and percentages and is you know he's shooting 51% from the field not that high for a guy like or excuse me it's yeah it's not crazy high for a guy like him I expect his 42% 3-point shooting to come down but I think it's free throw percentage is fine don't really expect much from like a rebound and it's just standpoint to change I will say a lot of his family is coming from his 2.1 blocks per game last season he ever point eight so if that comes back down and then kind of normalizes to like 1.3 1.4 yeah it's gonna be a big hit to his fancy value because blocks are weighted so heavily in a category League look at the same time you know I don't think I would trade them unless I could get like a guaranteed  like the like a 25th ranked player for him like if you want to trade me Karl Anthony towns or something like that for him we're gonna think about it but I would probably just keep tiaca or a Barnes if I just had them at this point  yeah I'll probably agree I was gonna say top 30 so top 25 yeah he's blocks I don't think they hold it 2.1 I could see him blocking over a shot again  one point 1.0 1.1 this is sort of what we were hoping for last season from him we was everyone was pretty high on him they thought he was gonna run the offense a bit more and it didn't happen and now that van Fleet score and I guess they've they've just gone to him a little bit more but if you watched he's last game which was  was it last night last night's game maybe he was pretty bad in the first half I think he only had like three points at half-time and then he just went off in the second half and and maybe over time I can't remember if that game went to overtime but it hasn't been all all sort of Roses and Rainbows so they have been some down points but I yeah I do think he's in for a good season but as you said I probably would be looking for a second round a third round at minimum  all right we got a couple of questions here from from our guy free key is asked us about Nicholas Claxton if you're frustrated with that situation you don't want to deal with you know however long he's going to be out you know now dealing with I believe a high ankle sprain and there's been some indication you know this could be multiple weeks if not months who are the type of players that you could you know offer you know you obviously you're selling low on Nicholas Claxton so you might have to buy low as well do you have any interest in Derek Lively and Russell Westbrook are there any other you know kind of struggling young players or veterans that your your pretty confident or going to bounce back  if I have Clacks in I'd be holding  for an offer like what Lively and Westbrook although I think if you're  if you have Lively in Westbrook it's like worth a shot to try to get Clacks because the the ankle inch issue it really is unclear like you know we had Eric Slater of clutch points report that a left a high ankle sprained is a six to eight week recovery time table but the Nets are kind of treating him as day-to-day so you can't even be shocked if claxton's out two months so maybe there's an impatient manager especially if they're at the bottom of their league and they just need points you know the or they just need production but that's you know that's something you could think about I think from both sides  yeah first and for about are you looking to sell Nicholas Claxton I think is one way to look at it  oh I'm probably not I don't have any way so personally I'm not but if you do have him I probably wouldn't just because I don't think you're gonna get anything back  that's equal value at the moment as you said it would only be if  I guess if you can cop that loss because you would have drafted him wanting rebounds and blocks so that's what you'd be potentially looking to get back to trade if you are looking to shore up those categories Lively in Westbrook Lively's been a bit up and down he has looked good at times and then he has looked like a rookie at times Westbrook we don't know what he's rolls gonna look like with hardened there now so if you're  if you're looking to try and get back soon just throw all offer out see what happens but if I have him I probably be hesitant  if possible because we are only in week three so maybe we get some more clarity at some point in the next week about whether it is a two week injury or a six to eight week in your another quick one on siakam this is quickly devolving into a pascal Seahawk compat here would you trade it for mpj is that is that selling too low  I think that's selling too low yeah see how come touches the ball and still handles the ball enough for me to to want him over mpj not to mention Porter's injury history on probably I'd probably do it for mpj  I don't know if I'm buying mpj at that price I mean he's been off to a good start but I think he kind of is who he is at this point and you know the promise of him developing into a true Star level player it just doesn't doesn't really seem to be there even as he stayed healthy you know he's just kind of become this the spot-up guy and the rebounding tests to come and go the defensive stats haven't really been there but I I don't know maybe it's just because I have yakim on somebody teams out but I I couldn't quite settle for that return interesting question from Marco what do you project hardened stats to be  I mean difficult to say of course and I I think part of it depends on you know how long do they insist I'm trying to start Russell Westbrook I think that could last like two games tops you know maybe it works out and they find a way but that's just doesn't seem sustainable I think it talking to a lot of people about this Alex I found myself to be on the more optimistic side with Hardin you know even though he's forced his way in and out of so many spots like wherever he's gone he's produced you know especially for fantasy and you know we've seen him play alongside multiple Stars before so you know the presence of PG and Kauai doesn't really scare me all that much it's like even if hard it's not the best player on his team he always ends up with the ball in his hands because that's kind of the only way he knows how to play so what do you what are you kind of look at what he did last year and say maybe you take away five to 10% of that to be safe it's tough to say for sure but I think he could still be a pretty pretty Elite fantasy player  I think he can be a very good family player you know last year he ever 21 and 11 six rebounds as well and 37 minutes some of this equation to me comes down to is he going to continue playing 37 minutes you know if the Clippers really are this good with him and you know he is 34 maybe they caught his men gets down to 33 34 minutes a night especially when you have guys like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard and even Westbrook who can take on more usage you know when we're not after the trade I went in and changed his projections because that's what we do I projected him for 19.7 points and 7.5 assists the assist I know are a bit low but think about how much Kauai handles the ball and Paul George and his you know is how much is Westbrook gonna be out there you know I would rather under project them over project him I also gave him a three minute per game discount or a decrease compared to last season so I mean I still think he you know under that sort of premise and you haven't projected for 66 games I think you return third or fourth round value so I think wherever you drafted him would you probably drafted him especially late in the draft season like maybe in the third round I think you'll be fine  yeah I mean by the end of draft season he was going in the mid-50s and like when I did buy nfkc I think he went like 55th that was the day before the season I never really felt like he was in danger or missing the entire year and I think it probably would have been slightly better for his fantasy value to stay in Philly but if you got him in the 40s or 50s I think you're gonna be just fine it's hard for me to imagine hard in falling off to that degree  oh man let's see  let's talk some Dentistry  because it's asking about what do you think about Schroeder is it sustainable for what he does to statistically he's been a vastly better fantasy player that Pascal saieko so far I would like to say it's not sustainable but if you could just tell me that he's on this roster the whole year I think it kind of is partially because they have nobody behind it  they have nobody behind him he is still you know I I saw this stat I think when they were like three games into the season but I just double checked and yes he is still 9th in the NBA and touches per game to me that is a like a massive stat for for Schroeder 25% usage rate I to me this is pretty sustainable there's not a ton that true is doing right now especially when you consider how much he is touching the ball that is is really unsustainable I mean I don't look at he's not gonna continue shooting 42% from three that's not what we is it's going to probably normalize down the 33% but you only lose what 1 Point a game off of that so yeah I think if you average is like 15 and 8 for the rest of the year I just don't see why he couldn't do that sort of giving like the underlying usage  got a question about Buddy Heald from Brandon buddy hield thoughts I'm very Pro buddy hield as you know I've telling everybody who will listen that since he's been in the league he's played 23 more games than anybody else he never misses time he consistently finishes second in the NBA in threes behind either Curry Lillard clay or Hardin I think he'll probably do it again even though it's minutes have been up and down even though they might trade about some point he is somebody that I love rostering it feels like his costs his cost never increases the way it should like there's always a 30 spot difference between where he finishes in total value and where he's drafted but it Telly has you know some sort of severe injury I don't care if he started I don't care if he's coming off the bench if he's playing he's playing fewer minutes to last decent he's still giving you 3. 2 3  yeah it's tough to say after they you know they didn't agree in that extension he's coming off the bench now his minutes like you mentioned been up and down I to me he needs probably 30 minutes a game maybe only 28 to be like a 12 team guy depending on your build he's getting 24 right now but we mentioned it's up and down I mean I think if you drafted him it's a whole I think if he's on the waiver wire you can just grab them I don't think there's a reason not to that's that's where I stand on him  I've got a question about Trey Murphy from Ian is Trey Murphy playing this month  I would be pretty surprised if he doesn't I mean there's a video of him like two days ago shooting around during pregame and basically full uniform look good to me I mean look like somebody who could play very soon I think the initial timetable from early September was eight to 12 weeks 10 to 12 weeks so we're yeah we're nearing kind of the conclusion of that I mean obviously we don't know exactly what he'll be back but I would be I would be very shocked if he doesn't play at some point in November  yeah I will mention Adam King will not be returning his internet is too bad to continue but we appreciate his effort and his insights but yes Trey Murphy  like you mentioned you know the timetable that they gave up initially puts a an estimated early return like the earliest expected return at the middle of this month so yeah I think there's a pretty good chance he plays this month I would be shocked if he was not on the court by December 1st so I think yeah I think you whatever you drafted him for you stash mine your IR you don't have to worry about anything anything like crazy  yeah but to use a turn of phrase that has become legendary at RotoWire barring a setback Trey Murphy will be playing at some point this month Tice Jones Alex Skeeter 221 asks his ties Jones a must add if he was dropped in a 12 team 9 Cat Head to Head League he has not surpassed 30 minutes the season that is accurate he is not surpassed even 28 minutes this season got off to a pretty nice start had you know there's three games 14 points 7 assists one and a half steals you're feeling good but these last two games  22 and 24 minutes I don't I don't really know what Washington is doing with the rotation right now because it's not just ties Joe it's like it's not like they're you know they're siphoning off his minutes to somebody else so it's like kind of who's most minutes have been down Jordan Bulls minutes have been down as well they've gone to a more egalitarian approach I guess this is one way to say it part of it is there you know the cops would be facing big deficits right you know when you were yeah when you're down 20 going into the fourth quarter against Miami it's just gonna lead to you know more scrubs seeing minutes but I mean they've been playing real routine they like 13 guys most nights which is just horrible for fantasy nobody on the Wizards is averaging 30 minutes a game they don't have a single player averaging 30 minutes which I don't know if that's ever happened before through like five games of an MBA season is he a pickup a 12 team her  I think he probably is but I would not pick him up and expect him to start seeing like 32 33 minutes a game because I think that would require watching them to be really competitive and of course Jordan Poole and Kyle kuzma are doing so much in their offense that there's just kind of scraps left for him because Jones is more of a floor General right and they're not really letting him do that  I think he's a 12 because he he's ranked 100 25th and 8 cat which implies on a four game week he's you throw them in there  but yeah it's not  I don't think it's like a League winner to pick him up  Dice and Daniels or Jordan Hawkins presumably as a replacement for McCallum I would lean Daniels some more unknown there but I think better fantasy potential whereas to me Hawkins Hawkins is the guy if you need if you need threes if that's a category of need in a roto league go grab him I mean he's jacking up like 8:30 is a game over the last week and a half but I have a little more faith in dice and Daniels as the the overall better fantasy player yeah this is this is a tough question to answer  you know it's actually Kyra Lewis who seen the most magnets with McCollum off the floor followed by Dyson Daniels but Daniel's only has a 9% usage rate in those 58 minutes some of that's because he hasn't committed a turnover you know 8.6 assists five rebounds and like you mentioned with Hawkins he's out there jacking up you know 12 threes per 36 minutes without McCollum on the floor so it kind of depends what you want right if you want to assist grab Dice and if you need threes grabblox welcome Brogdon has been looking really good says the cousin's 9855 thoughts on him yeah he has played well he's been seeing a ton of minutes you know he's somebody who likes Jane and sharp has picked up a few more minutes in the absence of Anthony Simons the only thing really holding him back in category leaks is the field goal percentage is way down and he's under 40% from the field he's at 33 percent from three so he's losing some efficiency but other than that I mean he's on track for like what might be the best counting stats season of his career but they would Brockton is you know how long is the on this roster I think at some point you know he's gonna get scooped up by Contender the question is is that a month from now is that at the trade deadline is it sooner I don't really know I think with Brodhead I'm just I'm just holding him if somebody you know for some reason is offering me Malcolm Brogden trades I'm willing to hear that but I don't know if I'd be actively selling him you know if he's gonna be out there for 35 minutes a night with nobody Simons for the next  month I'm just gonna ride that out  yeah it's scoots missed the past two games that's been huge for brockton's usage  and I think he's definitely a hold until Simon's comes back but even even when Simon's was available you know I think it's  I think you could probably expect some Broadband is still play 20 to 25 minutes a game and he proved to be fantasy relevant last year when he was seeing that many minutes so he's definitely a whole maybe he's a sell high again depending on who you can get but I think all this production he he's done this in the past  I got a question about herb Jones very Pelicans heavy part of the podcast here the way I'll frame this one to you is like I really like her Jones specially for Steals and blocks those are both been there lately you know give you some threes every now and then actually what I have nine at the free throw line against Detroit last week but I think the concern with herb Joe's is okay whichever he's back what are we looking at so it in the next week or so are you maybe floating out some some herb Jones offers looking to cash in before Murphy returns yeah I would I wouldn't mind doing that because like you mentioned when when Murphy comes back Murphy's a better player he fits better within their offense because he's a floor space or herb Jones isn't and then you have the column situation too now so I heard Jones you know he might be he might have some nice games coming up and you're able to sell high but you know I think when both of those guys like last season you know he played 30 minutes a game but Ingram and Zion can Ingram yeah Ingram and Zion combined for like 75 games or something so he got more minutes and more usage if everyone in the Pelicans is healthy it's not easy for herb Jones to see 29 minutes and it uses just gonna be even lower than it's been so  to me he's a sell high if that's sort of the angle of the question  yeah I would I would be looking at it that way as well how about Jaden McDaniels we'll take a few more of these but before we get out you know off to a bit of a slow start as only played in three games so far the minutes of not really been there 20 to 24 minutes in all three games he's giving you some blocks that is about it are you willing to drop him at this point or do you need another week or so  I need another week like he's um like you mentioned if you can shake off the injury you know we have to we have to see if that's the case so I that's a hold  okay who do you guys think is leading the Rookie of the Year race and who do you think will ultimately Win It Well Skeeter we have a fantastic page over at rotowire.com you can check out updated Futures odds you can compare sportsbooks and I will tell you right now that the odds on favorite at least at the DraftKings Sportsbook is Victor webmin Jama by a lot he is -360 that's the heaviest those odds have been dating all the way back to the summer you got Chet homegroup at 5 to 1 and then a huge drop off down to scoot Brandon Miller and a Sr Thompson those guys are all 25 to 1 I mean it's it's webinar was awarded unless he gets hurt right I don't see any way around that I mean it could be what I didn't beat end up winning at the one year that he only played like 30 some games was that the Malcolm Brogden year I think that was there was there were significant momentum because that was so clearly the guy and he played less than half the season even with women yeah it's like if you just gets to like the 50 game Mark that honestly might be enough especially with  scoot that looking good I mean that was to me that was kind of the guy that was gonna be in position to play a ton of minutes and put up big numbers the whole grids can have something to say about it but it's still between those two it's so obviously what Minneapolis right now Yeah you mentioned the odds there are shortest 350 as long as minus 400 you know points best feels the strongest about it it's too many of the year yeah exactly I mean to me what I watched it play women yamas should be the fan I mean when the Raptors you know they the Raptors end up coming back and winning  that game last night but through the first half of that game Toronto and yes Toronto is a bad 3-point shooting team they had no idea what to do with women Yama because they were trying to go to the ramen Yama was standing there and they were like we can't do this you know he was he was dominant um you know you I think the point of like yes he could get injured I think that's a good point although personally I think home runs actually more injury breasts watching the way that his body moves in the way that he falls and stuff um but yeah to meet chats only a bet as like a  you think women yama's gonna get hurt or something and you want more value reminder to everyone listening live here on YouTube or on Twitter or if you're listening

podcast streaming right here on the RotoWire YouTube channel you can find it on our socials as well we appreciate everybody jumping in and setting us some questions gravel Life TV says Jeremy Grant thoughts you know Alex I was thinking about you know this weekend as I do my box score you know checking in the morning and at night we're seeing something like Carmelo Anthony type of lions from Jeremy Grant who is doing just nothing but scoring maybe if you rebounds here and there the assists are down the defensive stats of completely evaporated but at least he's giving you points  he's giving you points and that's pretty much what you drafted him for I mean is his numbers these are not that different from what he was doing last year although he's not shooting as well so once his shooting is actually once a shooting improves its possible he sets a career high in scoring this year just based on improved percentages but yeah I don't expect the rebounds to pop up or anything partially because DeAndre and is like trying to lead the NBA in rebounds and then the assist stuff you know Brockton is handling a lot of the ball now Simon's is going to handle when he's back sharp spin handling in the meantime um so yeah I I think what he's doing right now is essentially what he's what he's going to do for the rest of the year yeah you just hope that the percentages improve and if they do is still going to be a fine fantasy asset but yeah any hope of Jeremy Grant like everything running through him I've almost given up on that already especially with Simon's gone like At first I'm like all right I got all these Jeremy Grant shares here we go and he somehow like passing the ball less than ever despite being the most established option on that team so yeah if you're in it for the points and you kind of know what you're signing up for then you'll be fine but doesn't look like he's going to you know have notably higher upside this year than he has in the past  Dillon Brooks are the numbers sustainable for Dillon Brooks we talk a lot Alex about  the Houston Rockets they got too many miles to feed it's been frustrating for Jalen green Jabari Smith even Fred Van fleet has had his ups and downs  not telling Brooks baby five games in 18 points four and a half rebounds two and a half assists one and a half steals I mean shooting the lights out right 60% from three 60% for the field 93% at the line to me I think that's probably where the regression comes believe it or not I'm gonna say it I'm brave enough to say Jill Brooks will not shoot 60% from the field but in terms of the county stats like I guess the rest of this is the rest of this legit I mean I think I think the rest of it is fairly legit um you know I don't he's never averaged more than 1.2 steals in his career but he also has zero blocks right now and he's been more of like a 0.3 blocks guy so I think you're you're kind of balancing out there yeah I think everything but the percentages are sustainable his usage rates actually 4% lower than it was last year and this is kind of where like  I mean I would definitely sell High personally like I would I would look to move off of this immediately because when he finally starts shooting 40% from the field again he's gonna be averaging 13 points a game and instead of 18 points a game so it's it's definitely a sell high for me  all right Steve Sexton who can only assume is a relative of college sex and he said he was offered Darius Garland and Daniel Gafford in exchange for Tyrese Maxey is the safe are deal  wow um  it might be I think it's a fair it is a absolutely a fair offer the person that you that I offered this to you definitely respects you and respects the same thing to be a fancy basketball I think I think this more so depends on how you feel about gaffer because Garland and Maxi I think have probably similar upside the season I think Maxie does have more upside bye  man  given the way that Gafford has looked which is just like not amazing and the muted minutes for for Washington I think I would rather be on the Maxi side but if you're really thin on centers for example I would think about it  I think rest of season like Garland versus Maxi is going to be really close you know Maxie probably regresses a little bit I mean it's been as good of a start as possible through two weeks you know I do think Maxie could absolutely finish higher the Garland but I don't think it would be a huge gap so you're totally right I think it depends on one how you viewed Daniel Gafford how sustainable you think his role is and perhaps more importantly do you need a Setter if you if you need help at Center then I would say probably take this deal it's not a bad deal  right all right try to find one or two more here to end on talked about Hardin here's a good one is Grant Williams almost a bus roster in 10 or 12 teams playing a lot of minutes for for Dallas team that doesn't have a whole lot outside of Luca acai re he started all six games so far 15 1/2 points five rebounds but that's that's about it he's hit a bunch of Threes I guess three three point eight made threes per game yeah if you're if you're playing in a roto League then he's probably a bus rosters in a 12 teams I think  I might zag remember I think I'm gonna zag off you yeah I think well I think he's a sell High okay because he's shooting 56% from three and how many of his field goal attempts are coming from three seven of his nine field goal attempts are coming from three is shooting 56% from distance there's no like uptick in usage the other stats aren't really doing much for me so I look I don't I won't blame monkey for rostering him in 12 he's shooting so hot you almost have to when a guy's hot like you might as well keep them book if you get if you get offered like a top 100 player for him I think you have to take that deal like the second that you see it pop up on your phone  okay we will end on this one as I put the wrong one up there doesn't Bane for McCall Bridges so I don't know you know what side the the question asked her is on here but we'll just talk about these two if you could roster one going forward for the rest of the year who do you got  I think it's Desmond Bane  um so you know Brett I just Bridges is not doing really anything more than he was doing last season which is of course very good but Bane is like the clear number one option on that team they have no I mean I told my rant comes back they have no other like legit scoring options no other playmaking options the the Nets have shown that well partially because of Camp Thomas they have other guys you can who can score for them so I would rather have Bane I think the the market favor of bridges is that there is this the Specter of John Morant coming back and what does that do for Desmond Bane if you take that away that it's to me pretty clearly vein but I think it is fair to say okay you know 20 games from now do we see Desmond Bane you know regress to maybe being the third option given how important Jared Jackson's become but yeah I've been disappointed with Burgess man I mean he had that incredible run right after the trade last year and you know I mean I saw him go in the first round of some early drafts you did feel like that cool off a little bit but he still been pretty good like the efficiency has been about the same as last year it's not shooting the three quite as well but he still at 46% for the field 90 1% of the line the defensive stats haven't quite taken a step forward but he's done about all the he could I think to to live up to to pretty high expectations and what's ultimately a weird situation in Brooklyn I'm with you I think if you know got to my head I would go Desmond Bane but I think that's a pretty fair question I think Bane Bane feels like it's off to the hotter start whereas it you know a month from now we could look back and say okay Bridges might be the guy with higher upside but yeah a good question there by n baracha we appreciate everybody listening along asking us questions in the chat makes us a lot more fun makes a lot more productive for everybody make
