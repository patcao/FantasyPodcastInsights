hey everybody I'm Dr Ace Steve Alexander that's Rick kamla this is the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast it's Thursday November 30th we have a lot to talk about some big returns from injuries busy night and the NBA that's in season going on we're gonna do all that right after this sweet Jam what's up everybody the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast with the ogs he is Steve Alexander acha doctor a I'm Rick Hamlet aka the freak and let's get to a doc ah we had as you mentioned some big returns last night let's start with Jamal Murray he returned from an 11 game app since on the reality side the nugs did a good job of hanging in there they were six and five without him they maintained a second spot in the west despite missing all of those games and there were very good at home without Murray and then very sucky on the road without Murray and all of that made sense right so we come back last night he turned his ankle again doc so here we go again now he stayed in the game but he did not look right I was focused on him I wasn't even watching the ball was just watching Murray and a lot of his movements he had to like move his body around his ankle it was like he was really favoring his ankle he wasn't necessarily limping but every time he went back over to the bench I had a Grimace on his face was kind of like  retightening his shoe and all this ankle stuff right so he had the hamstring that kept him out and now we've got this to keep our eye on he was really good doc 16 and well wasn't really good but solid 16 and 6 3's in 22 minutes doc I want to hit you with a fantasy basketball I guess hot take here at the top and bounce this off of you I would recommend trading Jamal Murray right now if you can I'm not asking people to sell low on 75 cents on the dollar in this kind of thing but if you can move them from market value maybe you want a big maybe you want a more reliable point guard I don't know but I'm concerned about this ankle Doc and Jamal Murray is not different this season and I thought he might be coming off the awesome playoff run he's still in yoke it's just Shadow the stats are not spiking he's not even close to get you know from going to 20 points again to 25 points again and I don't think any of that's going to happen he's pretty much the same dude he's always been and he will not make the All-Star team this year um and so I recommend trading Jamal Murray right now that he's back in healthy before we get another don't you and before everybody kind of realizes yo he's going to be muted again  yeah it's interesting and if there's a guy I don't want  laboring around out there in favoring one ankle over another to cause a different injury to eventually raise its head its Jamal Murray so I'm a little concerned about the ankle I'm a little concerned about the overall health I'm not saying I'm panicking like I need I need a full report as to what his status is after last night's game before I'm going to panic on him but I think to your point is it a bad idea to shop Murray and train right now no it's not a bad idea at all  all right doc um so Murray is back and it was fun to watch the nodes with Murray Michael Porter Jr had I mean Chris Marlowe said on the broadcast last night this is the most confident I have seen him as a shooter in the NBA as like whoa but we had Marvel on our NBA radio show yesterday I was like that's quite the statement but it's no coincidence that that happens in Jamal Murray's first game back all right let's talk about CJ mccollum's return doc he missed 12 games and I believe the pills were five and seven in those games CJ was fantastic last night 204 and 5 with a block with two steals with three threes the goodies doc the goodies the fantasy gold we have missed it for so long his return was no news for Zion Williamson 33 points awesome line from Zion he didn't miss a shot from the field ah CJ's return was a massive buzzkill for Brandon Ingram 15.7 shots his return was a massive buzzkill for Dyson Daniels and Nagi Marshall in Dynasty or for deep leaks this was interesting uh  CJ mccollum's return was not a buzz kill for Jordan Hawkins the rookie out of Uconn 16 points and 24 minutes he was fantastic I would try to trade Jamal Murray for CJ McCollum right now Dynasty League maybe not we got a big separation and age but in a redraft type of deal I would be so let's merge one with the other here doc I feel great about CJ coming back he's got the ball in his hands he's gonna put these stats up consistently uh you know bi this thing is weird I want you to talk to me about that and and if you're kind of shuttering what would be I hear moving forward but CJ's back doc talk to us about it  well are you aware of where he ranks  this year in fantasy  I hit me top 20  which is weird because he's usually fifth sixth round just  chilling down there not blocking a lot of shots not stealing the ballot and he's doing everything right this year for New Orleans maybe that's because maybe it's because Zions out there and healthy maybe it's because Brandon Ingram's out there playing with me he's got teammates around him for the first time since he played with Dame really so that's that's very interesting I was glad to see that Herbert Jones did not take a hit last night I think he played 33 minutes we have to see what happens when Trey Murphy comes back with with herb Jones that's gonna hurt a little bit because herb Jones has been I mean he's been his as great as CJ has been fantasy wise so CJ to me  is kind of a cell hi guy right now but I think  he's healthy he's playing he looked good last night he had all the goodies and I think trading Jamal Murray to get CJ McCollum right now I was not about it all right that is Dr a I'm Rick Campbell he's Steve Alexander we're the ogs all right it's the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Mr a is making a comment here he says hello guys I'm your Avid fan um we love that you're an avid fan we would like that we have more than one Avid fan right he's claiming I am your one Avid fan so my story we broke and everybody come on in here I hit up the comment comment section here on the streamyard platform and we will answer your questions later on in the broadcast here all right the OG's continue and I want to wind you up here on on Devin Booker okay he obviously he's been playing coming off of I just what the hell was his injury before this was a hamstring doc there's so many injuries here the calf cat soft tissue all right lower extremity saw I feel like a hockey guy right now that's a lower body injury any old way um Devin Booker might miss time sorry doc I got to just quickly add on a piece of until I got about the pills um a little birdie told me to Trey Murphy is playing on Friday night take that and do with it what you will basketball World fantasy basketball world but a little birdie told me that Trey Murphy's coming back on Friday if it doesn't happen blame the little birdie not meet just want to let you know so Devin Booker turned his ankle last night doc played through it um not initially he went to the bench and was like oh my God books gonna miss him up it was a bad ankle turn he's on the bench he's got a towel over his face oh my God I'm so much pain all this stuff and then he went wait wait a minute I'm a Kobe guy  I preached the  mama mentality  I gotta come back to play all right Bradley Beal is gonna miss the entire year all right we can't rely on him I got to do this so we came back but he was in a lot of pain and he said after the game he was a decoy out there and that it was a long flight to Denver all right leaving the door open to missing time with the cycle injury depending on the swelling and sort of and all that kind of stuff and I called them the bubble wrap Sons for a reason when they're guys are slightly hurt they don't play I was actually shocked at book was alive to come back into that game last night at Toronto um obviously if you got racing out if you got Eric Gordon giddy up man giddy up don't change it then don't send them to waivers up because book may miss some time right here how are you feeling about this this new development with Devin Booker I've been fired up about  Eric Gordon kind of all season because with no Beal and with with Booker being banged up like he's been he he's not a well-rounded fantasy guy but he's gonna get you three or four triples a night he's gonna score a ton of points he's gonna play having minutes and run into some other stuff while he's out there but yeah this whole thing we see it all the time man guys go down they sprain their ankle you see it on TV it looks really bad they're able to play through it for the rest of that game they go back they get re-taped I don't know if they do anything else to it or not but they get back on the court they finish the game and then we always say no watch its gonna swell overnight this he's gonna miss two weeks he's gonna miss ten days and that's exactly what this feels like with Booker I mean I would be shocked if he if he  if he plays next week there's only two games next week right with the NC's tournament so we got the rest of this week we all next week I don't think he's gonna play until after next week so it is disturbing the sons you know  I I don't like what's going on with this Phoenix team really much at all um Katie fine  um the brand beetle thing  I mean you and I have been complaining about it here for weeks and months and it's just it's filtering down to the rest of the the rest of the vibe of the whole team it's just  he's supposed to be the man he was supposed to lead them you know be their third  spark plug and he's just not there and I they just  just seems like it's kind of a lost cause to me  so the nurkic thing is going very well and Joel embiid I'm feeling some kind of way about your dnp last night because doc like he got he got ruled out what 15 minutes before the game something like that and there was a lot of reporting about this illness frankly I don't know if there was any um and so I had I moved on and was doing some family stuff you know set my lineups of course I said an alarm for 6:45 check the wire check news just in case there's any late stop nothing about him bead and nurkic I think had 19 and 14 had a goody line oh my God and so that was on my bench so dwell on me thank you thank you for that really appreciate that but the nurkic thing has been fantastic and Phoenix man um he is more comfortable he's more motivated um I mean he just was drifting the last two years in Portland Maine he was like give me out of here and you could tell with his play had a lot of bum nights um and he's not doing that in Phoenix he's actually been pretty consistent I know you wanted to get us talking here on the ogs the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Steve Alexander I'm Rick  Camilla about how screwed the Warriors are without CP3 and Doc to get Shams and woji yesterday reporting that it's a nerve thing in his lower leg not good dude I you know doc I'm a big into conspiracy theories I also don't touch door handles I'm a bit of a germaphobe okay I'm kind of a weirdo  sometimes when they report injuries you take it at face value all right sprained ankle all right cool um when it's this woes called it left pardon me lower left leg nerve contusion  um what the f is that okay so when you like they like to mask a bigger injury dock with bone bruise they will call it a bone bruise right and you're like what's really going on here three days later meniscus Terry's going under the net what do you mean bone bruise it was a meniscus tear so I  think I'm getting thrown off here  by this reporting I feel like there might have been something more going on here with Chris Paul I'm dubious of this report doc so how's this all hit you  I mean I've never seen parentheses lower left leg nerve contusion that's we can't even say it we both stumbled over it because we've never had to put these  five I've never  seen in a blurb in the NBA player blur before in my life so again what is that it doesn't sound good the fact that the word nerve is in there it's a it's a bruise to a nerve in his lower left leg like that doesn't sound good when he went down you can tell he was hurt like he was in a lot of pain I don't think he's gonna be I don't foresee him playing very soon with that injury and he's 30 eight years old Rick he's almost as old as we are  I don't know man and again he was playing really well for this Warrior's team like it coming in the season and I didn't know how he was going to fit in how it was really gonna work but he it's worked out pretty well and it's really good  good combo for him and Steph Curry to work together so it it is gonna hurt man and I I kind of like your your boy  Jim ski here  stepping up and Chris Paul's absence I think Cory Joseph 10 years ago maybe I was fired up about that and not not today I've never heard anybody more fired up about Corey Joseph and Stan Gundy the other night and I've never heard more praise on a third point guard in my life I mean Stan Van Gundy was going on and on and on and I will what a great pick up this was and it's like dude I mean I got like I like standby is a good game analyst he's kind of prickly um and in general but I do like his game analysis he was banging on the Warriors that whole game about turnovers and fouls awesome right and then the set of record or something for most turnovers and combined Valentines to the other team in one game it was like some history and Stan was little game Stan Van keep doing your thing man it's Rick Campbell its dock a Steve Alex and were the ogs on the road of wire fantasy basketball podcast um talk about your boy Larry marking and document my boy he's your boy he's got left hamstring injury he will miss tonight's game is the previous game is well and you know what probably some more games from there I know you wanted to bring a flowery though here so hit the people oh I don't know that I have a lot to say here I know that you predicted this injury in one of the first podcasts we did together at RotoWire you're like I don't like marketing he's gonna get hurt he's not gonna finish it's all about the shutdown too doc listen to me I traded remember I told you about the Clarkson and tht trade right before tht got benched and I got who did I make that trade for OG on and Obi um and I had a chance with Christ Ken Crites who's one of the exact here at RotoWire um and I don't know I probably could have John Collins or PJ Washington and I traded kreitz Chris Paul in a bigger package right but he really wanted Chris Paul and I really didn't want Chris Paul cuz I got a million assists so I said all right cool and Paul was coming off the bench at this point this was before the dream on suspension when Paul's numbers went nuts and and I I went with PJ Washington over John Collins I like John Collins more um but I'm afraid of the shutdown doc I'm afraid of the after the  All-Star break and we're gonna play all these young guys so the keonte George show right he's the guy that's got sting power with this team they're not going to shut him down but they're gonna shut all these vets down yeah and Collins is a vet marking his event Walker Kessler is a banged up sort of at this point he's young so he's second year but they're not gonna they're not gonna risk Walker Kessler's future for the second half of the Season Jordan Clarkson Talen Horton Tucker the guy that I'm kind of digging in Sacramento Utah right now is the Simone funny Cheo guy fontecchio fontecchio Finance Geo  whatever watched a lot of jazz tried to help you out and spontaneous your boy I'm glad to know his name because I was looking at my phone yesterday I didn't even know what his name was it'll be the name I don't recognize when I get there and took me a while but he's been kind of he's been playing minutes and been playing kind of well I like using him in FanDuel because he's cheap but yeah marking in and you called this  I I don't know and then  you know when marketing went down with this hamstring everybody's like oh I got to go out and get Kelly Olynyk Kelly Linux gonna go off well that's not really happening either um  there's just not a lot to love about this Utah situation right now I don't I don't see it any very well I do think it's we're gonna get more keyonte George  than we can handle or shake a stick app for the rest of the season of that that is one thing that is  definitely happening  so let's work in a question here from the peanut gallery doc because there is a question or comment here about keyonte George Mr a who said hello guys I'm your Avid fan again we'd like to pluralize that and in fact we have we have all so in here a detailed look says hi Doc and Mr Rick Campbell I'm a huge fan too for eight years and counting on refreshed I mean eight years in counting now and going from my sixth Championship all right a detailed we hope we can help you get that um all right so the keyonte George know here and I apologize guys trying to find this thing here we go Mr a says is keyonte George a hole not only is keonte Georgia hold like to look keyonte George suck last night right doc that line was awful but if you did you watch the Pelicans game the other night the second of that stupid baseball see I hate baseball Series by the way I don't know where I hate baseball Series so the Pelicans got to go to Utah for two boring ass games in a row right give me a break I hate the baseball Series um but keyonte George was dunking on him hitting big threes on me had a big Stalin he was the player of the damn game so keyonte George is good to go the whole season man do you agree yeah yeah I not only is he a hold he's a must hold I mean if you dropped keonte George she's gone he might be asleep for a guy right now yeah he's a target for sure  I mean we've seen him play what 17 games and and he has really blown up yet is kind of a slow start but it's coming and you know once they demoted Taylor Horton Tucker and promoted fiance just starting lineup it was over I mean he's there for the rest of the season he's only gonna get better I got to hang on  back to Lowry marketing and quickly guys when he comes back from the he can't trade a guy with the red flag on him right it's just top when he comes back as a couple of 25 point games drilling threes again trade him okay trust me trade John Collins if you can't if you're in a dynasty League it's a different conversation but if you're in a redraft league um you should be looking to trade Clarkson that's gonna be tougher but but Jon Collins and Lowry at the position scarcity forward position you'd be able to get some business back for that speaking of forwards here or I guess Boston center now Chris stops porzingis doc let's talk about this Joe mazzulla said on Sunday that he's got a calf he'll be reevaluated in a week or so and it's so here we go with Chris stops porzingis in a calf injury and an out indefinitely situation how is this hitting you and how are you pivoting this news and fantasy basketball  well I you can't say we didn't see this one coming either we all saw it  would pay attention everybody saw it coming so am I worried about him a little bit I just think we're going to get through the two game week next week  and then he should hopefully be back and ready to go I know that it's different it feels different with him being with the Celtics and being injured than it did when he was with some of these other teams and being injured because he's such a big part of what the Celtics plan to do this season they're trying to win a championship he's a big part of that they need him out there so I think they're just gonna let him rest let him get healthy in throw them back out there until he gets hurt again three weeks later and then three weeks again after that and then I it'll just be an ongoing thing  yeah they you know Celtics were weird places week because I only had two games and I know Sauron dropped my son dropped out Horford in a league which Horford then turned around and went off against the Hawks and he's like Dad why why do that um I mean you can get him back it'll be all right but with two games last week and two games or two games this week two games next week really an ideal time for poisoning is to go down with an injury hopefully you only misses four games and he's back so um I agree with all of that I like to point that you made about when you're with Washington who's in tank mode versus being on Boston who's in go for the gold ball mode and that will not the Boston's gonna Rush him back and be like irresponsible but there's there's just a different mindset and it will lead to more games played from poor Zynga stand with previous stops um for zingus was me and Antonio Daniels on NBA Radio we went into who's the best Alfred in the league you know that third guy now that Chris Middleton is not right and and you know not I looked at it in real time I just evaluated like an MVP race or who's the best out for right now not necessarily who I would want for a playoff front because that would probably be like an Aaron Gordon um with all the defense and all the stuff he brings to the table that dude's got tools on his tool belt but KP was the best Alfred in the NBA when I did this study doc probably 10 days to yeah probably about 10 days ago to maybe two weeks ago that's how well he was playing as that third fiddle to Tatum and brown so guys again Horford is a must pick up right now as a starter he's this year okay and it's I don't know a handful of starts eight eight and four two blocks one steal one and a half threes but like doc said the last two games have been really throwback Al Horford games and so he's gonna continue to start and put up really good like they full stat line across the board all right I want to give a little bit more advice here to the people before we give out our Underdog fantasy lineups tonight doc it is time for everybody to pick up Patrick Williams of the Chicago Bulls get him now while you're listening to this podcast Rick kamla Steve Alexander on the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast describe your phone and pick up Patrick Williams do it okay going back to the well here DACA been a Patrick Williams guy I traded a third round pick away to get him in the cam Dynasty I have since dropped Patrick Williams don't be mad at me my team is that  deep in that dark actually went okay I didn't even have room for I did drop camera reddish last night my team so damn good I don't want to drop camera I just gotta do what you got to do but I'm going back to the well okay because now Doc we got DeMar DeRozan turned his ankle against Boston the other night try to come back in the game had to eventually exit uh oh here we go Zach LaVine this foot soreness thing right um he had it he came back played a couple of games didn't look right reading the reports and watching him and then and then had to leave the Boston game at the same injury and now there's reports out of Chicago where the words shot down are in those reports so Patrick Williams is green lit for me and he's been good doc over the last four games he has been Where's the Line 14 points seven rebounds two assists two blocks one steal wait a second I'm reading the wrong thing here my bad this was his line the other night again Boston 14 and 7 2 assists two blocks one steal and made a three all right but over the last four games Doc he's been 10 plus points in each nine threes over those four games averaging six boards  with four stocks which is a little light I think when he really gets cook and he'll be giving you one block and one steal per game are you feeling me on this Patrick Williams diagnosis you know I've never bought into the Pat Williams hype it's all tied to Zach LaVine and every report we've read about Zach LaVine this year is bad like not really getting along with anyone kind of banged up kind of her kind of disgruntled kind of doesn't want to be in Chicago  um none of that has been good and if Zach LaVine is pulled out of the equation which you feel like he's going to be at some point somebody's gonna step up and it's probably gonna be Pat Williams so yeah I can get me high what you're saying I can see that Williams finally starting to live up to the hype but I'm for one I'm not racing out there to pick him up quite yet  I understand oh let's give the people are Underdog fantasy lineups for tonight you go first yeah we do that I'm gonna tell you about underdog  Underdog fantasy is the number one platform

and deposit bonus hi Rick I had some Underdog going last night  talk to me looked like I had a sure thing in the bag I had a five-leg  one dollar to win 20 dollar  parlay and for the five hit pretty early it was yo kitchen it was all the same game it was the it was the Denver Houston game  I needed some four I need four fourth quarter points from  who's the who's the forward for a Houston  ah Jabari Smith all right I need four points from jabbari  I needed six points or some combo six from Alpine with the entire fourth quarter to go 14 point game like this is money well Javari comes in it's a couple threes or whatever that's done so now I got four out of five I just need the six from Shane they leave him on the bench for the first like four minutes five minutes of fourth quarter bring him in  he plays one minute they pull him back out clear the benches it just wasn't meant to be right just another just another another tough tough night in the office for Dr a it's a bad beat dude that's a bad beat so let's give the people a winner here man you want to go first on your your Underdog fantasy lineup for tonight you know I'm Gonna Let You Go first because I slept on that assignment and was watching  old Kirby and enthusiasms and laughing understandable this morning instead of instead of picking out my Underdog play but I do this every day so I I can remember quickly but yeah who you got um all right so just quickly here and I'll buy you some more time to maybe make some some investment decisions I read before we came on here going through some news and stuff that Mitchell Robinson was talking about how dirty the ball is and how how discolored the ball becomes because of dirt bacteria germs all that kind of stuff and he was talking about how nobody in the NBA watches their hands okay so immediately the super grossed me out and it took me back to my boy Larry David who of course is a notorious term of hope I am a germaphobe as well I don't touch door handles if I have a long sleeve shirt I'll drop it down and use that to do the door handle or my feet or you know the bottom of my shirt it um I'm trying to stay healthy here all right you know by the way I was pitching like a perfect game until the flu the flu Gods went cam it's been a good run booze here's a lightning bolt down on you that's gonna last two weeks to a month have fun I did not have fun with that screw you flew Gods But but so that made me think of that doctor the whole the Curb Your Enthusiasm thing the greatest show of all time by the way but it's still pales to the magical body part episode when the Jets killed Carl it's still pales in comparison to that one all right doc I will unpack it for you here and I'm going to let the people know it's early right and they add props throughout the day okay so the guys that I wanted to bang tonight Malcolm Brogdon not yet available um cam Thomas is supposed to come back tonight like maybe if it's numbers 12 and a half 13 and a half bang this people um Jaime Hawkins my new favorite player for the Miami Heat this guy's cooking in the last five games at about 18 and a half points per game so I'm looking at like give me a 14.5 on his I'll bang that okay so just keep your eye on those we can't give them out yet cuz I'm a line for him I like Patrick Williams tonight like if its 11 and a half ten and a half bang that people um but I got SGA 31 and a half I don't like the number it's it's one up from his regular season average but the Lakers suck on defense okay cool um but this just feels like Lakers are in town Lakers in the second of a back-to-back maybe the legs are fully onto them the Lakers is you know doctor super short-handed and I could just see SGA just  flexing tonight I got SG over 31 and a half points did John Terry Murray goes back to San Antonio tonight I love The Reunion game angle and I also love doc the fact that San Antonio is defense sucks I also love oh that he has been under 20 points the last three games so the principal of do is in play here the bounce back factor is in play I got Murray over 20 and a half points and my best bad guy the best bet of all and I would play this individually DraftKings Underdog where you can get it is Steph Curry at five assists Steph Curry not five and a half well this is an underdog number so maybe they will put the hook on a on a DraftKings number but but five assists on Underdog it's a part of my parlay here it's my best bet he's been six assists in each of the last three games and so that's over this number no Chris Paul Draymond Green is not playing as many minutes right he's 28 29 so and I just think vibing out Curry from that Sacramento loss he's pissed he's over it he's frustrated and I think he's gonna be like yo clay don't got it if we don't got it and draymond's gonna be barking at the officials on all night I have to do this myself and I think step has been up to that a lot in his career and I think we get that type of game tonight Doc it's the Clippers out the Warriors um it it's a big game here obviously the Warriors sucked they've lost nine of their last 12 and so I got Curry over  five assists I got the jaunty over 20 and a half points and I got SG over 31 and a half points  I like all that um I like your SGA against the Lakers like he's gonna be he's gonna I agree I think he's gonna try to flex on them the only one of those that makes me nervous is is the Deontay and I love I love guys going into the former teams angles um  I'm all about that I'm just a little worried because Trey young has been playing much better lately and when Trey started playing well the gente's numbers fell apart and because Trey is a complete and total ball hog that too  and very selfish and very I I think he's a selfish player bro I really do  I think I think Trey young would rather have 30 and 10 in a loss then 18 and 7 in a win I really do  well I mean you might be right I I don't know but I just know that trees been balling out and Gente has not been I'm not sure that the two of them ever fall out on the same night I mean it happens occasionally been not very often so I'm a little nervous about that angle of that take but the rest of that I think looks pretty good what I'm going to hammer tonight if they give us more options right now it's just Jimmy Butler and Bam out of Bio but I don't know if you've seen the Indiana Pacers defensively this year but man they are like we're not gonna play any it's just weird because it's Rick Carlos right we're not gonna play any defense we're just gonna run up and down the court with you like Alex English in 1979 from with for the nuggets and and just score as many points as we can on you and you're gonna have to catch us and you know the other night they played Portland and my buddy  my buddy and FanDuel just hammered every Blazer and Jeremy Grant had like best game of the year Deandrea not his best game of the year all these guys just balled out on the Pacers I think Jimmy Butler is I mean he's points are 23 and a half he's probably gonna blow that out of the water bam had a bios points or 23 and a half he should be good I'm actually probably gonna do the 40 and a half points rebounds assists combined for bam because I love I love the way bam passes for a big man but I am going to hammer the Heat tonight against Pacers and to your point Jaime Hawkins has been awesome I think he's gonna go away when Tyler hero comes back I'm a little sad about that and Duncan Robinson I think is going to play better tonight which is probably gonna hurt him a little bit the man he's been pretty fun since Tyler heroin down so doc I totally understand what you're saying and you might be right but I feel like Jaime Hawkins is going to have staying power and let me explain um the fact that SPO is playing him with finishing lineups to me speaks to a trust level that has surpassed Duncan Robinson that has surpassed Heywood hi Smith who's hurt right now has it surpass Caleb Martin know I can't go there but I feel like hockey is going to be a half the game player even after hero returns I don't think Hawk has gonna you know be out of the rotation or turn into like a 15-minute per game guy we're like you five three and one is his line tonight I think we're still gonna get half of the game from Jaime Hopkins and maybe even more he's a first round pick they got a lot invested in him and he's just he's so good with fitting in with these guys he he's basically docked the new Macross right he's a good shooter he's a good Defender I mean he literally he plays a ton of point guard for this Miami Heat team where he literally brings the ball up and gets them into sets he'll grab a defensive rebound and just dribble five times and then get a guy in the post and hit a little turnaround on him without even passing the ball like he's really flowering right I should say a blossoming right now and I think he's got staying power so we will watch for that do you know go ahead go ahead in my I did a male bag column for RotoWire last night it should be published it's probably being published as we as we speak one of the questions I got from mediocrity was how do you see how does fairy once Jimmy Butler and Tyler hero or back on the floor his decision-making and defense seemed likely  his decision-making and defense seemed like the afford him some playing time maybe it Richardson's expense  okay go and I said mediocrities while I agree with you that has earned time I'm just not sure he'll get enough of it to sustain the necessary you know fancy value we need for him he stay on rosters I don't think he's just gonna go away I don't think they're going to put him on the bench I think he's gonna get 20 minutes  maybe 22 uh but he's not gonna be the guy we're seeing without Tyler herro there and without you know Jimmy Butler taking every other game off so I'm just I'm just gonna be prepared to part ways with Hakeem if I have to because we got a lot of guys in fantasy basketball on the IR right now and a lot of people are starting to make preparations for bringing those guys off the off the IR and I'm getting a lot of emails like hey I need to drop two of these guys which two do I drop and it's like since Santee yellamma do I drop how many Hawkins do I drop PJ Washington Kobe why is Jones your guy um so a lot of people are gonna have hard decisions to make coming up and you know it's gonna be interesting to see how this how this all shakes out but I think with Tyler hero and Jimmy Butler both healthy it's gonna be tough for Hawks to get enough minutes to to be a must keep guy I got one more hot take for you and then let's go to the streets here so this will be a fun debate for us to monitor moving forward as we continue to do Rick Kamala and Steve Alexander the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast the usage of Amy Hawkins or not I have a hot take for you I I would not be surprised if the Miami Heat win all these guys are healthy rock is starting five of Tyler hero Jaime Hawkins Jimmy Butler Caleb Martin and Bam out of Bio would not surprise me at all Lowry B Off the Bench don't get Robinson would be up to bench Jay Rich Off the Bench I Smith Off the Bench then he would have the love in Bryan combo behind bam just throwing it out there I don't know that that's going to happen I wouldn't even call it probable but I think it's possible so keep your eyes why is Kyle Lowry starting at this stage of the game anyway because Heroes out that's that's why I think when hero comes back he be look like I said Hawkins is running one  for the Heat  Jimmy Butler brings the ball up gets something into opengts right they don't it they don't need Rondo out there uh doc a right I mean but I'm telling you like to Me Jaime Hawk is on the ball so much is the one um the Yahoo's and the cbs's they need to add PG to Jaime hockett's and fan tracks where Cam Dynasty is I believe they need to add PG to Heine Hawk I maybe that's another hot take here but I see him on the ball as the one a lot well I will say that if he moves into the starting lineup or if he sticks if he's in starting lineup  when hero and Jimmy Butler are both playing and I will take back everything I just said and I will buy all in on Howcast I do love him I think he's got a great Ikea a great understanding of the game very high basketball IQ SPO loves him I think his teammates love him yes they love playing with him he looks he looks like he fits in out there he looks right passes the eye test all that stuff so I mean hang on a hawk is as long as you can um hopefully hopefully you know hero comes back we get to see what happens after that so here it should be coming back pretty soon here over the last five games hockey is it 18 1/2 points the heat leader over that stretch one point two steals two threes 56 506 86 with the shooting splits that good all right doc um what up one more thing real yeah the

detail who we talked to earlier here we go with Eric he says we'll pop up his his note here do you think Kara silver's value sits somewhere between where it was and where it is currently thank you um he's always a guy that I sleep on Doc you know it's the bench thing right and you got screws coming in there and you've got this core of Garland and Mitchell and Allen and Mobley and so he's a key kind of gets lost in the shuffle for me a little bit to me I look at him more of his reality guy then a fantasy guy because I mean what are we going to get 12 4th Guy Do you have do you have something else you want to tell me about Carole so I I look at his value the same as I'm kind of always looked at it  yeah  I tell you though there are times when  he comes through like if somebody's injured and Carol's gonna play Big minutes he puts up he can put up some good numbers so I'm with you I think he's more of a reality player than fantasy guy I don't think he needs to be rostered everywhere right now but you know if there is Garland's out or somebody else is out one night running out there and see what happens because he's he's he's he can put up some decent numbers he's about 13th round value right now so he's just Clinging On at the end of benches where he usually is he's a streamer he's a pickup if one of the guys goes out like doc said but that's where we're at with that all right let's pull up Lester's note here he says Middleton or tyus are os 9 cat Roto this Roto thing man where is the HTA guys play HDH is HDH Dying by the way Dr is HGH still thriving and very very prosperous you tell me I don't I don't different every every site is different like ESPN  they tell me that their legs are mostly 8 to 10 man leads which is crazy to me because I don't play any 10 man you know football league's are you know the standard ones are 10 teams yeah and yeah I don't anymore because 10 teams get out of here with that 18 so the roster percentage is a real different you look at roster ship in the ESPN versus Yahoo it's different because ESPN has smaller leaks but yeah head-to-head I don't think I don't think it's going anywhere I don't think it's it's time but then again you know I talked to people in the when I'm out in town or on the golf course like fantasy basketball I didn't even know there was a thing I knew about fantasy football and it's like okay well whatever end up I would take my clubs and leave the course I had to head head to head is fine hey hey I'm going anywhere all right wanted to take your temperature on that so what Lester says Middleton or tyus roast nightcat Rodeo ah you guys the ties Jones thing um the plane is still on the tarmac all right think about this you're at LaGuardia or you're at Newark right you know how traveling out of those airports goes right you're on the plane we're ready for takeoff and in the the the I like it on this the freaking pilot thank you going back to first grade um says we got a mechanical malfunction and we're gonna be stuck on the tarmac how long we don't know sit tight all right you're there for three hours right that's the Ty's Jones experience this year this is a gigantic fantasy buzzkill we're talking 10 points we're talking five assists we're talking I don't even think of Steel right at about a three he's been a monstrous disappointment for me in the 30th and I'm still trying to win but I will not win this year because my team is so mediocre largely because of Ty's Jones so doc I will take the old and decrepit and often injured and Superman it's restricted Chris Middleton over this young prosperous fantasy sleeper gone wrong ties Jones how about you  I can't I can't do Christmas Milton man I can't do it there's no upside to tie his Jones and he will be shut down after the All-Star break you know this right no I don't know that I don't know that he's young he's he's the crazy thing I was really I was looking at this last night we're only what 17 games in his number his minutes he's getting three more minutes a game this year then he got last year he's in a featured role as the starting point guard on this team yet his numbers are exactly the same as they were last year he's exactly the same and it's total bus go like you said  and how much is it related to Jordan Poole like is Jordan Poole  mentally Buzz killing that entire team to where they're just like oh my I like they don't even know what to do anymore they have what two or three wins Denny of diesel looks decent tires looks terrible Jordan Poole you know we talked about in the air and my only note on Jordan pools I had written down for Tuesday's podcast was Jordan Poole Dash what the hell what is he doing and it like  he's really Tires Jones in the process like I don't know man but I don't know wait on time Joe's before I'm going  with your boy Middleton I'm not into the Middleton experience at all I'm taking the lesser of two evils here and the lesser of two evils is khris Middleton who is going to be playing more and more and more and we think unless he's put back into bubble wrap Patrick O'Hara is with us he says am I dropping Jordan Clarkson over sharp pool and Beasley in a 10 team punt assist field goal percentage team um punch assistant is that illegal that does not do assist in field goal percentage is that he's punting those he's giving up in those he does  okay so let me let me compute this 10 team we don't need assistance we don't need fuel goal percentage am I dropping Clarkson  let me think here that shit on Sharp I would rather I mean sharp is the main hole out of that whole thing Malik Beasley I'm not I'm not really feeling that I feel like I can get more value out of Clarkson until the shutdown um I've only holding on a pool so Beasley's the drop there for me yeah and I mean if Middleton's going to play more yeah I don't know um  I would drop Beasley out of that group myself and and shade on Sharp is taking a bit of a downturn with whole Malcolm Brogden being back so shade on Sharp is gonna be showing up on Waiver Wires I'm afraid and I don't know if you should be or not but I I'm still super intrigued by shade on Sharp  he he most definitely should not be on waivers he's one of those guys um  you know I mean if you're if it's starting to lead to L's and a bad rating on Yahoo all right maybe maybe you got to do what you got to do but I I would I would hang in there with shade and sharp until the last possible moment um you know like like the rocket in an action movie right like holding on for I I hold on man I would hold on all right Lakers Nation says doc should I trade some bonus in green for in bead nine cat  oh man um I don't think so doc I don't um I would I would rather and I I mean a beads is so massive this year the assessor way up around last I checked there were six point six which is second on the team to Maxi at six point nine that was prior to last night's game um I'm not I I mean I love someone bead doc but nah sabonis is a beast man 1712 and 7 every game um you know Jalen green has been I think a little bit less than we thought but still really solid that third quarter he had last night against Denver was something else so I'm not doing that deal.com about you that's what I was gonna say about Jalen green is he's looked better over the last week and he did the first month of Seasons so I am a tree by Jalen greens sudden emergence I think there is hope there sabonis and green I mean if you want Joel embiid on your team this is the kind of guy that this is what you're gonna have to do you're gonna have to give up two studs to get him back and with out seeing Lakers nation's actual  team and they make up of it it's hard to say yes or no on this if you can trade a two-for-one not lose depth and add Joel MB to your squad I don't I don't hate that trade if you're getting them be  if you if you have an abundance of depth and you've kind of got a consolidate I understand and I've had to do some consolidation trades in the cam Dynasty with you know a bunch of guys on on the IR and then they come off and and so you kind of prep for that I'm not a guy that will like  like she you know what I mean and like have injured dudes and then they're not injured and leave them in the injury spot I think that's pretty lame and I'm very kind of I'm very I don't hands off dock like I'm not like going through every day to see who's roster is legal and illegal I just try to mow my own backyard the right way and I did play against a guy last night I mean I'm cooking them this week seven one I'm looking for an 8-0 and I'm trying to pass Ken Crites in the first place in the cam Dynasty we both are 30 and 10 right now but the guy played against last night didn't even set his lineup like that really pisses me off man and his team sucks but put put that body's in there you gotta you gotta at least set your lineup man um so that bothered me all right one more here from let's put this one in and let's put this one up it is a mayor rummage I hope I got your name right sir would you trade Cade for Kessler in nine cat 12 teams set up I'm worried about if he will play with the Pistons being as they are thanks guys I'm not trading away Cade for for Walker Kessler and Doc I've been going back and forth with a team manager in the cam Dynasty about Scotty Barnes and Kate Cunningham um I got a thing for Scotty Barnes man I'm sorry I do I got a thing the defensive goodies are amazing that I mean the blocks the assist this year like it's it's all happening I got a thing for him and this guy wanted he it was like Cade Cunningham Jalen Johnson and a first round pick next year for Scotty Barnes and I got back to this guy and I like this guy a lot but I said to him um that offer is hilariously terrible one of the worst I've ever gotten in fantasy basketball I mean it's got awful right like and I told him back I said I would think about giving you cage straight up for Scotty Barnes okay like I don't even know if I want to do that I probably would document me into a corner I'll probably give you Cade for Scotty Barnes but here's my worry with Scotty Barnes okay what if uh because we know that the dismantling of Toronto is going to happen right see I can find all of his deal oh John and Obi might be traded okay cool Scotty Barnes it's his show for how long Okay DOC for how long before you go get up nasty point guard that's a 2010 guy taking the rock back from Scotty Barnes um maybe you go get a hot shot through free agency right and now Scotty Barnes is not the first option he's the second option what is Scotty Barnes is traded and his new team you know looks at him is more of a role player and a glue guy and like a main guy you don't know what I'm saying so  I mean I mean I'm into the Scotty Barnes thing but I can't I I'm still like there with Cade Cunningham doc I'm not ready to cut the cord yet matter of fact I'm not even close to it so talk to me about all of that right here are you trading um Kate for Walker Kessler a probably not I mean I think Walker Kessler is just as good a shot as getting shut down as cave does actually I probably would do it because Cade  yeah I scratch that I would do that trade Cades Cades fantasy ranking is awful dude  awful he's like 16th round  well then why would you do the trade  to get Walker Kessler  why the hell would you trade Cade Cunningham for Walker Kessler you just banged on Walker Kessler know I'm talking about hey  oh I think you're all right my bad maybe I'm not speaking right no the guys said would you trade Cade for so you got to give up Cade to get Kessler and is a 16th round fantasy player right no I get it the efficiency sucks the defenses in their shooting is terrible I don't know man um the threes are decent from Katies about two a game um I don't know I feel like  I think there's more there in I mean they got yours have been starting over Kessler right now  well guess who's been hurt because it's on a minute minutes count still yo he ain't hurting now bro why is he starting dude he's not good at fantasy basketball right now oh wow shots fired by the way Detroit does not shut down their main dudes following them the last couple of tank years they don't shut their guys down I don't think they're going to shut down or Ivy down or Oscar down I don't think they're going to shut him down by the way I Cade Cunningham's numbers are not good for they hurt your fantasy team more than they help you  and I would rather have Walker Kessler having said that your guy Jade and Ivy is making it a splash lately and I think it's time to go pick Jade and Ivy up everywhere I think he's gonna go off the rest of the season  as soon as Monty Williams came to a census and moved Ivy into the starting lineup it was giddy up time for Jane and I should have always been giddy up time for Jade and Ivy and to me if you were if I were doing a coaching power ranking one through 30 Monty Williams would be 30 on that list I think he has done a God awful job of coaching this team this year his rotations have been sucky he continually bangs on his players after all of these games what it's like yo Monty your coaching with a win now philosophy on a win five years from now team what is going on here and he's flexing that he's the highest paid coach in the NBA I'm not feeling it at all Doc but this has been a fun hour with you my friend on the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast you got one more thought for the people I'm gonna be back on Tuesday with your guy
