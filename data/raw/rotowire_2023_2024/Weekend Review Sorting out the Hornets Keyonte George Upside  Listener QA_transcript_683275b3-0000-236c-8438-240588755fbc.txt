welcome to a Monday edition of the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast barotha hanging out with you for the next hour or so we can check this out on the RotoWire fantasy basketball YouTube page you could like subscribe we appreciate both of those things you can check us out live on Twitter as well appreciate all the comments everybody hanging out as we do this live and everybody who listens on the archived audio version as well Alex so I want to you know talk about a little bit about the weekend so with the big fantasy storyline coming out of another busy a couple of days in the NBA we will talk a little bit about the upcoming schedule of course no games on Thursday and then later in the Pod we'll turn it over excuse me to a live listener Q&A in on his Betty questions as we could get to we are finally at that point in the year Alex where I think you know basically a month in you know multi teams have played what 13 games or so that we can at least make some conclusions about what we've seen so  far first few weeks of the year there's so much variants there's some guys in and out but you know I think for example in the Eastern Conference Boston Philly Milwaukee Miami those are the four teams at the top that seems about right and that'll change as things go along you know Orlando New York Indiana those teams are right there but it does seem like you know we have just enough of a sample now that things are starting to standardize yeah we're like 15% of the way through the season um yeah and so you know you're able to see how some of these teams look when they're healthy when they're not healthy they playing some good teams some bad teams so like you said this feels like an appropriate sample where we can start sort of projecting things out and if someone's really hot you know that we weren't expecting to play that well or someone's really cold now is the time where it's like you're approaching it's it's like panicked time  it may be Panic time for both of us in the Rhoda wire 16 team stake auction League Alex I actually feel like I had a pretty good weekend you know I played a lot of golf I was traveling a little bit this weekend you know Saturday night I'm checking live I was checking yesterday I had a bunch of guys going and I'm like man Laurie marketing two overtime gaming went off it's gonna be great I saw a lost girl and that League man we both need a miracle there it is it just to the point and I'm not I'm not proud to admit this on you know a live internet stream I picked up Andre Drummond off the waiver wow you know what I didn't pick anybody up but I I won't lie I clicked his name and see saw what he had been doing lately and I'm like you know you know I mean maybe I could drop Sexton maybe I could drop Alec Burks just kidding no I I can't actually because of Rozier smart and Anthony Simons are all out for me so I'm getting getting absolutely crushed which I know it doesn't sound like a lot putting a 16 team auction where you live in that's so brutal yeah yeah it's it's been bad for me yeah I I I'm really liking behind it feel gold percentage in that League partially because Damian Lillard you even always drawn together some nice games I think he's gonna be fine long-term like he's shooting under 40% Jared Jackson we'll talk about him in a bit my goodness that's looking like a massive blunder by me to to pay up for him in the auction yes Iacocca Market in those guys are back on track they're both shooting close to 50% I don't really have any complaints there but you know I kind of thought I'd be in much better shape you'll go percentage wise which was why I draft to like Malik Monk and Gary Trent and these guys who you expect to kind of hover around 40% and now with some of the injuries and the way that the position eligibility and the schedule breaks down this week it's like I'm desperately trying to gain ground if you'll go percentage and yet I'm starting to the worst field goal percentage high volume chukars in the NBA so yeah we got to work to do there we'll keep you guys posted if we can crawl out of our early holes in that league but we appreciate everybody joining us already in the chat I will take a couple questions you know early on we'll do a full Q&A over the second half but this is an interesting one because it leads into a team that I want to talk about 12 team 9 category League Prince Fountain asks what do you do with PJ Washington and Gordon Hayward we've talked to talk about the Hornets on the show just because they're a team that has a lot of variants with this roster obviously they brought back miles bridges on Friday he played a couple of games over the weekend and you know we saw PJ Washington's minutes drop off against the Milwaukee on Friday went from you know normally playing in like the 32 to 35 range to 26 checks the Hornets also just got their doors blown off and that one was basically over by the end of the third quarter so I don't put a lot of stock into that either way I mean pretty pretty dramatically poor games for both Washington and Hayward I'm not really sure how to handle this so because both of them like the minutes were there right I mean Washington went two of 13 from the field over the Hornets two games over the weekend and Gordon Hayward had similar numbers you know went to of 16 from the field so you know where do we come in on you know the addition of Miles Bridges versus just a random kind of two game variants for for Hayward in Washington  yes so minutes wise it was miladawn didn't play um you know that that's saved some minutes and JT Thor Stars saw some you know garbage time during the Milwaukee game played a little bit more with Nick Richards out against the Knicks yeah I mean the Gorgon Hayward one is the most concerning partially because he hasn't scored double digit points and his last three games six total assistance past three games and you and I definitely were cautioning people look he he's gonna lose you should Bridges and he's gonna get hurt and it's going to be a concern Washington I mean sometimes PJ Washington just shoots like one for ten he's not really a consistent guy like he'll score four then he'll score 16 so the fact that he over you know because he had four points on one of eight and he goes for 32 on 23 shots and then you know three shots ten shots it's just he's probably droppable but I would maybe hang on another week just to kind of see what happens  I mean Gordon Hayward was awesome early in the year if you roasted him and started it for those first two weeks I congratulations I might be the best two weeks of the season it's really tough to say for sure though because of Rozier you know that's another what 28 to 33 minute I was just out right now and you know so many of these players for Charlotte Bridges Hayward Washington even Brandon Miller we'll talk about in a sec all those guys could play multiple positions so there's not really a one-to-one like all right Rosie's back now player exclusive minutes it's like I think a combination of Hayward and Miller both losing time is probably most realistic you know maybe lamelo loses a couple of minutes but he's playing 36 38 minutes a lot of nights they don't really have a ton of obvious depth at either guard spot behind Rosier and La Bella ball I don't really worry about miladawn or you know Bryce mcallen's guys like that you know in conjunction with this free key asked you know how do you think Brandon Mueller specifically has been its will turn out when everyone is healthy and again this is somebody that's tethered in a lot of ways to Terry Rozier we saw Brandon Miller you know have one really nice game against the Knicks on Saturday 29 Points on 10 to 15 five of seven from three he said a couple big games you have the third game of the year against Brooklyn he had like 22 and nine for the most part he's just been kind of sitting in that like 10 to 15 Point range I think I mean he'll continue to have nights like this every now and then but I don't think I don't think what we saw on Saturday is like an unlocking of Brandon Miller like I think if anything I'm even more skeptical of him going forward with the bridges back and what's Rosie's back that I was coming into the year when I you know I was curious to see what he would look like I I ultimately don't think he's going to be a great fantasy player in year one good players like Kipling aren't  no um you know yeah he got a nice game against the Knicks like you mentioned caught some lobs was going to transition um caught fire from three this was just a great game forums best game of his career maybe except the one against Brooklyn earlier but regardless yes I mean the encouraging thing is that in both of these past two games he has been over 20 usage that's good that's where we really what you're looking for like if someone if Mueller can continue playing 30 minutes a game I get 20% usage he's gonna be fined a roster but the point you're making about Rozier I think is is really is really important because Rosie is like a 25 us guy and yeah he's gonna steal minutes from some guys at the end of the bench who aren't playing that well but it's just going to be fewer shots for for Miller who I it's it's just gonna be tough for him to see enough touches  I want to talk about Orlando Alex as far as an early season you know team that's off to a good start they've won for their last five three in a row beat the Bulls back to back Wednesday and Friday and then a really impressive win over Indiana yesterday the final score does not do it justice I mean it was 128 116 or Orlando was doubling up in DNA at one point early in this game like when I first checked the box score like in the middle of a football Sunday it was like 7436 or Lando you know Indiana there still a team that's prone to some variants Albert and is it rolling but you know I think we can football about how much it means to you know to beat a team like Chicago but I thought that was a really impressive way over Indiana you know they beat the Bucks pretty handily a couple weeks ago was well they have a win over the Lakers they have a win over an approved Houston team my question is like are the magic team that we have to discuss for you know could they get the five six seed in the East or you are they still a team that probably falls back into that play in conversation I think they could get that that spawn the East because I think you know Milwaukee's really picked up their play Lately got a very good win over Dallas you know obviously there's still kind of part of tier one even though they've they've struggled a bit so if you just operate under the assumption that it's like Celtics 76ers box for the top three seed I think the rest of the conference is fairly up in the air like I don't think they're as good as the Nicks or the Hawks or the calves but then maybe I guess the third tier of the East  sort of fighting for that sixth spot that final playoff spot and I want to be too surprised if they got it now we would be great if they could get Mark helpful it's back and went oh Carter Jr obviously has all been out so that's a problem but both of those guys can come back sooner than later I feel even better about them and because they're already eating five yeah you're right I mean we could say that you know though they're hurt by the folds and Wendell Carter apps it's and they absolutely are but to be eight and five without those guys I think makes me feel even better about them in the long term ultimately you know like what I bet that they finish higher in the standings in the calves know I think the Knicks probably pass them up as well I think that Nic team is to be a really good regular season team again but you know Orlando Indiana Atlanta and you know probably Toronto is the other team that I would throw into that next year and you know there's those are the teams that I think will be battling for 78910 in the Eastern Conference you know I think Chicago's on the way down Charlotte's been at disaster obviously Washington in Detroit and Cape Cunningham basically came out said today that yeah we're a bad team we need to accept that we're bad and figure out how to get better we can't be lying to ourselves which I appreciate the self-awareness there but yeah I think the way that the East is breaking down right now or land o' clearly looks like they've leveled up from last year ultimately you know probably a team that pushes for low low  40s in terms of wins but you know a team that should be better once they get those guys back I mean I know you had a note in some way we're working on this morning about Anthony black who has had to pick up some minutes you know with Markle folds out it hasn't been great so far for Anthony black  no I yeah he's with fultz out you mentioned it he's been he's been playing extra minutes I think Suggs missed a previous game as well two games ago so I look Suggs just he's shooting 30 like over his past what five games the starts that he's that he's had five in a row 32% from the field more turnovers than assist its Four Points I think it's just he is not someone who projects  well first of all he's not someone who projects good for Fantasy at all period we also not someone that projects to be good as a rookie because he can't shoot and he's on a team with a bunch of other bad Shooters and he's only 19 so you know he's not someone I'd be looking at in terms of like fantasy wise but the fact that they're playing him someone who's struggling this much they're playing him 20 25 minutes they're starting him and it's still working out for Orlando is pretty impressive yeah yeah we mentioned Detroit as a team that's off to a slow start I don't think that really changes you know I think this is a team that had some some interesting pieces and obviously the emergence of a sar Thompson has been a lot of fun and I think for the most part you know Kate is like the guy that we thought he'd be even with the slow start shooting but you know Jane Ivy's taking a big step back and you know I think they've really been impacted by the absence of jail in these last few games as well he is questionable to play tonight so they're leaving the door open as they have of late but he's missed four in a row he's missed six games already overall we got a question in the chat or during going forward which is an interesting one I think you could kind of play either side here  I give slightly to Clarkston because I want the blocks but what's a you if Duran was healthy and we was healthy I would pick Duran because I they have also the the Pistons have shown more willingness to play during like 30 to 36 minutes and he can get a double-double and he's passing as well but the fact that he can't seem to shed this ankle injury gives me some concern I think I would still lean Duran but again like Nick said  if you want the blocks you have to go with with Clacks then yeah during obviously if you need the rebounds that's the way you lean but you know Clark has been fairly disappointing so far with the blocks have been there and you know really that's what you're chasing more than anything he's got multiple blocks in four of his five appearances so far and his you know dragged out by missing a couple weeks early on realistic trade Target for Jordan Clarkson  that is interesting I like this question Jimmy Carter if you streamed Clarkson last week perfect that hit about as well as impossible could have I was watching I watched that entire Suns Jazz game last night without the sound so you know it's a little bit you know folk singing more football even by Jordan Clarkson standards some of the shots that that man was taking my goodness you know got blocked into what turned into like a fortuitous rebound for them to force a double overtime against the Suns last night he's feeling himself right now there's no question about that and you know marketing is still the guy I don't know if Clarkson knows that there are a lot of possessions where I thought marketing probably should have gotten the ball and did not get a touch but you know we go through this every year with Jordan Clarkson and you kind of ride it while you can I mean there's times where he can he can look like a top 70 fantasy guy for a week or two at a time but I also totally understand wanting to sell High here you know difficult for us to say what you need or whatnot but I mean do you think you can get a bona fide like top 90 guy right now for Clarkson  well you said you can look like a top 70 guy over the past two weeks he is ranked 30 seconds and ate cat value yeah it's it's Jordan Clarkson time yeah the man is on one I mean look past five games he's taking 22 shots a game with five free throw attempts as well the the move of keyonte George into the starting lineup has just honestly ended up in like Jordan Clarkson balling out more yes because Kathy George's is setting him up a lot um yeah look like he's ranked 94th this season I think if you can get a top  like top 75 player for him I would do it um I think they're also has to be some concern about like are they going to try to trade him  and then does he end up being a sixth man somewhere and realistically speaking like I mentioned he's taking 22 shots a game he's shooting he's 5490 over the past five games like first career he's like you know 43 33 805 yeah  yeah if you go percentage always comes back around with Clarkson the turnovers could be there if you're in a nightcat league and I think your spot on you said but I was gonna bring up which is I think the fact that he is starting specifically next to abaji and he update George is huge because you have to George is a little more willing to shoot but he still he's still a Passer First and doesn't he's not really comfortable you know watching a ton of shots bhaji took one shot of 34 minutes last night of a double overtime game you know like Jordan Clarkson is in a perfect situation right now where he can kind of be in his mind the code number one next to marketing and you're right I would worry about a trade I mean last year he kind of got shut down at the end you know when the Jazz went into a late tanks so that's another concern as well you know if you could trade him for I don't know what like a I'm looking to kind of similar players ranking him like would you train him for like Josh giddey if you could get that he ranks the hell yeah I would definitely Dragon for getting yeah I don't share right I don't know if somebody would make that deal I mean like what about Keegan Murray or Shane sharp guys like that  um Aaron Gordon I actually I would not  for Sharp or Murray because to me Murray you know Keegan Murray shag and sharp and Jordan Clarkson are like very similar stats wise for Fantasy they're not similar players but for Fantasy they're kind of just giving you points in threes  and you know I have worries about sharp obviously when everyone else comes back  is it possible for dice and Daniels to retain value once CJ McCollum and Trey Murphy are healthy I would say no I I'm not I haven't been thrilled with Daniel so far I mean we barely saw any of them last year so it's kind of his rookie season in some ways the minutes have been there of late I mean he's playing he's playing like almost shade sharp minutes over the last week like you started its started six in a row play 37 minutes the other night against Minnesota you know the assistant the steals are what you're really chasing there is actually been rebounding pretty well in addition to that but you know they're getting Jose Alvarado back in addition to McCallum and Murphy at some point and I think Daniels will still be a part of the rotation but I mean before we went down McCallum was playing 3637 minutes like he's their point guard they need him out there and I think Trey Murphy is a 25 to 30 minute guy you know maybe we see a little bit more of like herb Jones sliding down so yeah I I don't think Dyson Daniels would be startable in like a 12 team League once those guys are healthy  no I don't think so because before those guys were heard he was averaging like seven four and three which is like if you're on a 16 Team league I guess you can have them on your bench but even with this recent stretch of games where he's been starting he still only ranks 100th on the year so to me that's like his very very healing when everyone is healthy and at that point he's just not worth rostering yeah and you know Alvarado  cool guy you know see kind of a meme type of player but I mean he was playing 15-20 minutes a night off their bench I don't think he's just gonna come back and be collected DNS like I think he is a real threat to minutes there and yeah I mean Daniel's if you're in a deeper League maybe hang on to him but I think barring mccollum's injury you know being something that spans and other month I would be looking to probably sell him rather than hold let's see I want to talk you know some more big picture stuff Alex Bradley Beal you know we got a pretty rough update on Beale over the weekend you know not only is he gonna miss additional time but they're rolling him out now for at least three more weeks so that puts Bradley deal out in till mid December I was actually pretty high on Beale relative to cost I thought people had backed off enough and you know in like the auction leaks that I did I thought you know James got him in the stake league and I remember telling him like that's a great five man good value  it's not going to be a lost year for Bill like I still think he could be a decent player but we started to see these last couple of years you want Washington I think it went under the radar that he missed like 40 plus games in back to back years and now here we are again where if he comes back let's say you know December 15th it's like you're almost kind of restarting the clock on him reintegrating with Durant and Devin Booker and to me I mean he's we already knew he'd be the number three but I think given these circumstances like he could be a distant third option yeah I mean you could get them in some leaks that pick like 75 which to me was like how you how you turn this down you know because you're like most other pictures shooting for upside like there's people drafting like Zach Collins at 75 you can get Bradley Beal there yeah I mean  part of the issue here is like it's annoying that they labeled this injury as soreness and then he plays a few games and now it's a strain like did it was it ever healthy in the first place did they just tell them like look you gotta try and see how you feel I again like if you drafted him  the good thing is that if you drafted him you probably got him somewhere between like 55 and 75  so it's not proud it's not destroying your team I think you're able to recover from it but is it is frustrating  another early season Trend no one wanted to discuss Alex LeBron James looking much like LeBron James that we've seen for the last 20 years yet again last night you know put up a huge game to to hold off a late rally by the Houston Rockets 35 and 37 points for LeBron and two games over the weekend I just missed one game so far due to maintenance he's played in 13 of 14 on balance he is the number seven overall player in total value so far this season is there any consideration to sell high on LeBron based on the the injuries that he suffered mid-season the last couple of years I've always kind of been in the camp that those are there's some flukey you know like I don't really think his body's breaking down it's more like all right Solomon Hill dove into his leg or his you know his ankle bent in a weird way like I don't it's hard to say because right now the last thing you want to do is put on somebody's giving you 35 8/8 every night but would you would you consider pivoting to a safer option health wise  after I absolutely I would actually um because some of his like I don't think he's gonna keep shooting like Miami Heat LeBron because he's 59% from the field 40% from three we saw so many times throughout last year how bad is 3 points shooting was um it's possible for throw percentage bumps back up a little bit but really again 1.7 Steals and point eight blocks for a 38 year old is pretty crazy and so you can buy and what I think will be just normal regression not to mention is usage rates actually down four percent almost compared to last year which is a lot normal regression can buy with the fact that he's 30 um maybe there will be father three maybe there will be rest days on the rise and maybe he will get hurt he was listed on the injury report for like two years straight right um so I would sell high if I could get like basically any any first round projected player in return like let me ask you this maybe this is too low but I'm curious if you had LeBron and someone offered you Tyrese Maxey for him what would you do that  they ranked they rank right next to each other right now and in eight cat value I didn't even look I just I was just pure Vibes actually ate LeBron 7 I  you know it would kind of depend on what I need in some ways but yeah I think I would take backseat I think I would I mean there there is that lingering fear though that the Sixers make a trade and bring in Levine and all the sudden you know Maxie really loses it but your contrasting that with the fear that LeBron gets her to miss his 20 games at some point and actually doesn't really have that track record yet so huh yeah I mean I think I'd probably wait a couple more weeks and try to time it out when I think LeBron's get hurt but no that's yeah that's a kind of a wild question but a totally fair one and I think if you want the stability and you're you know you're doing well in your league right now then yeah I think I think you could you could survive the you know the short term dip under the expectation that LeBron plays closer to 65 games and 75 games

he's looking for a streamer this week Daniel Gafford Dario tsarevich Jaden Ivy or Ben mathurin  um so I would want to I'm gonna say I have to look it up I have to see what their schedules are I got the scheduled up okay anybody who is on a four game week I think aren't the Pistons only on a two gamer yes so cross off Joe Ivy they're on a two-game week don't pick him up yeah what's the what's the weather of the game situations look like so the Wizards are on a four game week and the suns are on a four game week the Pacers are on a three-game week so I would narrow it down to Gafford and sarich for that reason and I probably give lean to Gafford and that situation although you know the points League maybe there's more of a case for Sarge do you have a strong lead between those two  I think I would go  Gafford um just because I'm pretty high in the blocks upside and it's minutes have been more consistent lately sorry it's possible storage has a big game I mean I like them as a waiver wire pickup this week  but I he hasn't delivered like a ton so I would go for  ya Gafford last five games 10 points eight rebounds 1.2 assists 1.2 steals 1.4 blocks and he has a three and a four block games breakdown in there he also has some zero block games that's bringing that down a little bit but yeah I would leave Daniel Gafford Emerson says he has Walker Kessler in his Ill Spot should he keep him yes absolutely definitely yes I know he's going to be out another week which is disappointing but he also returned to contact work so he's moving in the right direction like I don't think this was a major setback I think they were just a little aggressive on that initial timetable you know didn't didn't really light it up when he was healthy but the minutes were down a little bit I think that comes around I mean he was such a dominant shot blocker last season I think he can get back to the player that he was yeah I mean the the field goal percentage he was playing through a sprained elbow so you know some of his shots were his attempts were not as he's playing with his friend album he's not gonna shoot that well but yeah his his last four games before he got hurt he had multiple blocks in all of them and so that's something I like to emphasize too like you talked about Jaron Jackson at the top of the show kind of regretting where you bought in on Jackson  blocks and steals are incredibly variable stats like a guy will go a week with like you know two total blocks because it's something that happens in on one or two possessions a game for a guy so don't freak out about Kessler averaging two blocks when he died he's gonna average two and a half yeah I mean he had almost a 9% block rate last year which is Alter Ultra Elite you know anything over like seven is like really really good you can pair that to like Anthony Davis who was like 5% last year it's still blocked a ton of shots right so yeah Walker Kessler was that much better as a shot blocker and yeah good note by you on the injury I think once he's back at full strength we'll see the Walker Kessler from last year  Paul asks should I trade Chris Paul and Kevon Looney for James Harden  big time yes for me I would want the heart inside of this one 10 out of 10 times yeah Chris Paul Chris Paul and lunar like you can almost find that sort of production off the wire I don't know how shallow your league is I know Shannon you know Shannon and Ken are and NFP Casey League together and they were kind of debating now this was before Curry got hurt before Draymond suspension but they were kind of debating do I do we drop Chris Paul you know because he was averaging like before before the past three games he's averaging you know 8.7 assists a steal and a half in 2017 minutes I don't think you drop him but of course yeah definitely got take heart of  wildly interesting question and very prescient buddy hield or Santi aldama man for the week ahead so Memphis plays where where are they on my list here I think they have a four game week if I remember correctly know they have three game week and Indiana has a three-game week as well so for talking just for one week it's kind of a wash hi I mean you know I'm an undying buddy hield supporter Alex but it you know it's been a even more up and down than I expected of late the only play 15 minutes yesterday against Orlando of course that was a game that turned into a laugh or early but you know prior to this latest two game stretch he did average almost four made threes per game over his last six so I think there's going to be there's going to be more Peaks and valleys and there's been in years past but it is there a real case for aldama here  I would prefer aldama because I think you could probably stream like buddy hield has been so inconsistent  and they're not you know committed it clearly not committed to playing him like 30 minutes of game which is what I think he'll need to be fantasy relevant for the most part Alma of course like it's easy to say Obama after he just came off of like 2812 and 6 with two Steals on 27 shots against the Celtics but they're playing about small forward and like Memphis is rotation is God awful not helped by the fact that like smarts out now so I would I would lean Allama  yeah and you know I think there's the the prospect of like Xavier Tillman coming back he's been dealing with this kind of on and off knee issue you know if when he plays aldama tends to see a few fewer minutes but I don't really think it's that big of an impact so yeah I think for the time being like if they're both available to you you probably ride aldama over the course of the full season I think I'd still prefer yield but short-term it's hard not to lean aldama all right what to do with scoot Henderson I know somebody else asked earlier how long is he out  we have no real information on that you know they said I think it was 10 days ago they said that he would be out two more weeks so it's entirely possible that he could come back at some point this coming week you know there hasn't been any news of him like returning to practice or anything like that Blazers are off tonight they played Tuesday Wednesday in a back to back you know almost never did you see a player like missed the first half of back to back and play in the second so he's probably missing at least two more games so you'd be looking at maybe sometime next week we do get a decent indication though or at least we should because the Blazers have a four game road trips starting on Sunday so if you travels with the team that means he's close and could return if he doesn't travel with the team then you're probably looking at a couple more weeks  yeah if this question is sort of asking like if you have an IR spot you just hang on to scoot that's that okay if you're in like a shallow category league and you don't have an IR you know I know we're kind of Dipping into the weeds I think he'd be a fine job especially if you are losing like if you're really struggling in your league like if you're in a team or and you're in seventh and you have scoot filling up one of your four bench spots or something like it's not gonna I don't think it's gonna kill you because you just got to get points now  and I don't think he's gonna be great for categories  Skylar Bays or keyonte George  we we got Shannon and Ken and I have gotten a bunch of these questions so I'll lean to you my gut was keonte for the full season value  oh yeah full season I would definitely Gokey George you know with Portland it not only depends on Scott Henderson but also Malcolm Brogden who is kind of a more day-to-day situation you didn't play on Sunday is now missed five in a row when he comes back I think that immediately cuts into Skyler maze so if you're if you're just looking at this week I think I would prefer Skylar Mays but I do think that comes to an end sooner than keyonte George just the thing with George is like the assists are great you know he's giving you like eight nine a game over the last couple weeks he shouldn't 30% and he's taking a decent amount of shots so it actually is kind of hurting your field goal percentage you he's not really giving you steals so it's really just how much do you need the assist when it comes to him and are you willing to stomach the field goal percentage  Yeah it's better to points League I I will say I mean just the I think the what you have to consider is like how many guys in the NBA not just on the waiver wire how many guys in the NBA project to average like seven assists for the rest of the season basically there's very few players and George is one of those guys now  yep very true let's see should I drop amen Thompson he's currently in my L spot  I think you can because it's annoying because I think I think a man could be as good as a sar like but he's just not getting the minutes even before he got hurt he was barely you know he couldn't he reached 20 minutes twice I they're playing so well without him I'm not gonna say he's not gonna be in the rotation or something but they have a lot of mouths to feed and he's just not a massive priority for them right now yeah I mean biologically he should be able to be just as good as our top so there's really no question about that but no you're right and you know they also you know they didn't have Target Easton when he was healthy you know what more still not in the rotation but he's kind of hanging out there like Jason playing a little bit more yeah there's You could argue that there's like more resistance now than there was when he was initially playing before he got hurt so you know if you have nobody else injured right now there's no real harm I guess and keeping him in that spot but if you have another player that you want to move there I would say you're pretty pretty safe you know dropping a mental tops in and I don't think anybody's gonna scoop him up immediately let's see what do you guys project Murphy's value once he returns interesting question I mean obviously New Orleans we talked earlier about some of the the variables with with McCullum and Murphy themselves being out Larry nances out right now you know they've added Jordan Hawkins to the mix you know Dyson Daniels you know being heard for all of last year he was kind of out of the mix as well I'm a pretty big Trey Murphy guy I think that you know he could hit the ground running and be a big top contributor I mean he was he was cutting into her Jones minutes last year and that was saying a lot because I think they have a lot of trusted herb Jones got to 31 minutes a game was basically in every night starter but a big part of that season came out Zion Williams said so to me that's the that's the single biggest variable is okay what is a train Murphy playing alongside Zion look like  yeah Ingram and Zion combined failed to play 82 games last year so there was increased usage for Murphy namak columns out with this sort of a thing like he was he ranked he got you like eighth round value last year and I think you can project them for about the same if not a little more  you know again it depends on some of the injuries and he's going to develop two he's young but I would say like maybe a thrown value yeah I think that's really fair it you know his value is so closely tied to three pointers right I mean 2.6 made threes per game last year over 40% which I don't think is an anomaly I mean he was in an incredibly efficient shooter in college at Virginia so that was kind of expected I mean honestly I was surprised to the degree to which it translated right away even in his rookie season so you know somebody that you're definitely targeting for threes above all and you know I think that's the that's the category to monitor with him you know I wouldn't really worry about anything else other than does he giving you those high volume three  all right we talked to talk a little bit about during already you know he's still game to game we really know idea there Kessler I think he'll be back in about a week and a half and then our question asked her all so asked about Camp Thomas and when he'll be back  yeah I mean that one is seeming like it's somewhere between day-to-day and week to week at this point you know they said he's gonna miss two weeks on November 9th it's been 11 days so you know technically he could be back on on Wednesday I there's not really been many indications that he's all that close my guess is that we see campus at some point next week oh yeah I mean that's sort of that's sort of the vibe I saw another question earlier that we didn't get to about what we think he's going to what is production is going to be like now that cam Johnson is also back you know to me I still think you'll be like a top 80 guy I would be shocked if they bring them you know like lower than 25 26 minutes a game you know like Lonnie Walker have been good for them but it's just Thomas has to be the priority there off the bench for them assuming he comes off the bench  Koolaid tripping asks where you guys with and yucca Kung whoo he's not showing much improvement and not taking advantage of his minutes maybe he's not the future center of the steam  I will take any excuse to talk about a Kong woo because I just dying for him to eventually take over that spot but you're not wrong I mean it's kind of the same story as last year where he's basically glued into like 19 to 22 minutes every single night the blocks of coming on a little bit but for the most part that's been there you certainly like to see a little bit more from him I mean right now he's like barely even roster bowl and a lot of League's  is it going to take a cappella injury at this point I think maybe it was wishful thinking I buy part that you know getting rid of John Collins would actually open anything up for a combo I think a cappella injury or a trade you know they were it seem like they're willing to experiment a little bit more with a kangaroo a power forward because they were having them launched so many threes and preseason but in the regular season is translated to above a three a game and he's not really sharing the court with capella you know per 36 million minutes or per minute capella or excuse me a Congo still is like a top 60 player so if he if he does get the minutes he will produce  but  at some point it's like again if you're in a situation where you're not doing well in your league there's just any given week there's guys you can stream in and start of having a cone on your roster  yeah I think we're at the point with him where you're gonna need a cappella injury and if that happens you're gonna regret dropping him and you're gonna want to make sure you pay up for him and Fab you know 18 games last season when he started the average 10 points nine rebounds one steal two blocks 58% from the field in 32.2 minutes like whatever Capella's out I he's a guy that you absolutely wanted to line up but I think for the time being as long as healthy it was no real need to concern yourself a marquis asks Walker Kessler and Wendell Carter on waivers in attend team points league is it worth picking up and stashing either of those guys he has Murphy and Scoot in his IR spots right now I would much rather have Kessler than scoot  yeah not 100% 100% with you who's interesting like I do think scoot's gonna come around like I don't think he's just gonna be horrible the entire year and like the minutes are going to be there the Blazers are going to be bad like I don't think they're ever gonna go away from him so I would I think I would rake those four guys  Kessler won Murphy 2  scoot three Carter 4 you could flip off those last few for me  yeah I  you know so in a category League I would I would know question drop Kessler for scout it's a little it's a little different points League  so yes other way around you know points League I want sorry and a category League I prefer Kessler  overcooked for sure and a point to League it's closer because you know points like a sister worth so much and points League that like usage drives value in points and if scoots going to see 30 minutes and have 25 us I can't be surprised if yes he does  and we're more points fancy points per game then Kessler  Carter Junior and Trey Murphy to me are a wash so  I mean  it is actually tough on a points League  I don't know yeah yeah fair question I mean it's a good question it is all right Paul asks  who could I put together in a package to acquire James Harden and he lists Chris Paul kcp kavan Looney Derek Lively Yakima portal ties Joan's Walker Kessler Jalen Duren  probably none of those players I'm gonna be honest with you I I don't think anybody is going to want hardened for any combination of those players I your best offer would probably be both Walker Kessler and Jalen Duren and you might have to still throw in Chris Paul um but I don't I don't think they would do it yeah you said exactly what I would say Kessler Duran Paul you could try Kessler Duran Tice Jones you know I wouldn't I'd be a little wary of giving up on Kessler but if you're acquiring Harden like you know we say this is a reminder to everybody even if the Clippers are just asked her even if the Optics aren't good like James aren't still and incredible fantasy player and as long as he stays healthy his floor is like I don't know the 35th best fantasy players so I would I would want hardened over any one of these players individually by a mile I would think you could float Kessler and Duran and see if it gets it done I mean the fact that they're both hurt right now impacts that but if you know jail during comes back and puts up like a 14 14 game you never know  agreed yeah  all right Jason Tatum Myles Turner Tobias Harris or sabonis and Karl Anthony towns I assume this is a trade or kind of rest of season question I think I would take the Tatum side here it would take a lot for me to give up Tatum and I know  you know Tobias Harris is not going to continue  you know he had a really hot start his percentages are gonna fall off but Myles Turner's really underrated like Myles Turner and Karl Anthony towns you can't be surprised if they finish with a very similar fantasy value specific category leaks  so if it's a category League of me I would just definitely hang on to tail the Tatum side  yeah I mean Tatum is definitely the player I want most I mean he's super super safe if you could just kind of lock him into first round value he doesn't miss time totally right on Tobias Harris and obviously if the Sixers make a trade you know he's the guy that's going to get marginalized before anybody you know what turns to spend the time right he's basically been like a 2030 this game every year type of guy so I think this is a pretty fair question because both the bonus Aunt cat are you know top 25 guys but cats all the time of time over these last few years so he could kind of be thrown into that bucket yeah I give slightly into the three side of this one Tate of Turner Tobias but I don't know if your consider making that trade I think that's a pretty fair offer honestly all right Trenton asks us would you take cooler Bali Sohan maze Suggs or keyonte George in a 12 team points League we are we're gonna shatter the single show keyonte George questions the keyonte George he seriously dude he gets like the most questions out of anybody in any of these live streams it's I I don't I don't know what to tell people other than like it guys are not averaging like seven eight assists on accidentally over this long of a stretch and if this is a points League again the two main drivers of  fantasy value and points are minutes and usage and keyonte George has is projects to have long-term basically rest of season usage as a starting point guard sucks does not because of scoot brogden's gonna come back and Simon's is gonna come back or I said I don't know if I said I meant Maize I don't know if I said songs just fine because he's gets your Steals and Kula Bali gets your steals as well but I would rather have can't take George yeah I think I'm very interested to see where keyonte George is like two months from now you know I think he's the guy that I would want to hold for the long term and you know with Suggs once folks is back and they've had some other injuries too like Gary Harris has missed a bunch of time you know I think there's there's some luster that could wear off of him you know train follows up it says that they're all bus roster I'm assuming I wouldn't really say that it depends you know if you're into 12 Team league you know we're like a week or two away from Skyler May's probably being dropped you know I'm not really a big Sohan guy haven't really invested in him at all and like cool Bali like I get it you know he's playing way more minutes than I expected I kind of thought that you know this would be a big time to developmental year for him and you're gonna have to live with the games like he had against New York the other night six points three rebounds four assists and 31 minutes like those are going to be those are going to be pretty frequent but yeah there is some tree there particularly for the defensive stats and I mean cool Bali you shoot the three at 43% so far like that's gonna come down but like we thought this guy might shoot like 25%  yeah and the sort of the overarching thing here is if a guy can't consistently average or pull up 25 fantasy points a game he's not much roster you know 12 team you just gotta be 25 minimum to project so that's more of like a song and I can't say George thing would you move your kitchen Sohan for Claxton and shengwen  I'm not getting off of yokich I can't I'm not gonna be that guy either like I actually think  if someone like assuming this person offered you this trade and you are the on the yokich so hand side you shouldn't be insulted by it it's like a pretty respectable offer in terms of like someone trying to trade for Nicola yokich goes but I would I would just want the the yogic side for sure yeah and it's a testament to to shangoo and more than anything you know that this is like a Subway yeah fair question just because he spend that good but now I wouldn't I wouldn't be looking to get off you okay man you that's like the biggest cheat code you can have right now in fantasy basketball  who should I stash Kelly oubre or bojan bog danovich um I actually I wish neither was an option well I  Uber look Uber is shooting and me started to tail off before he got injured by a vehicle and so that that's I mean I just I think honestly is probably tropical and you know was definitely a sell High early in the year oh yeah I have no idea man I mean he had like Achilles thing at the end of last year I didn't know if it was real their team is horrible maybe he comes back and helps make them better it would be nice for him to be out there just for functional basketball reasons but even in like basically last year when he was when he exceeded a lot of people's expectations he was still like an ath round value wish me is like probably his absolute I mean absolutely healing for this year so to me it would be Bowie on but I would not hold my breath either of them being like worth holding I I just worry with bogdanovich that he like never plays for the Pistons you know and right it's just something where he kind of hangs out and gets healthy and then they trade them and you know probably except like a conditional first round pick and that's it I mean they're arguably the worst team in the league right now I don't think bringing him back into this really makes a whole lot of sense for them organizationally I think it's pretty clear at the direction that their headache so I would knowing what we know right now I would say Uber but yeah they're pretty comparable the rest of the way all right let's see oh very topical question here close to my heart should I worry about Triple J's blocks I worry about it I'll tell you that you laid out a very rational case early in the Pod that blocks tend to come and go and it's not uncommon for even the best shot blockers to you know go a week or two with eight block game but  oh last night against Boston seven games in a row now that Jerry Jackson has had one or zero blocks  I'm quickly looking at a contested numbers  so my so last year Jackson contested eight and a half 2-point shots a game this year he's contesting six and a half to two point shots per game so in theory yes his blocks should be down but it probably shouldn't be down  more than like half a block at most in theory because I think like one out of every 10 to flight it depends how good the shot Locker is you know contests to blocks it's not exactly like a one-to-one as much as like deflections to steals  but yeah I mean I I would be surprised if he couldn't get himself back up to two blocks a game  yeah I'm certainly hoping it's coming in my my season in that league is depending on it so yeah I mean you're certainly right to be concerned no question I would be I don't see more concerned at just what a train wreck that this is so far and just what that kind of means for the greater scope of their season but you know I think the marketing is huge obviously not having brand and not having Stephen Adams you're down you're down three starters how many teams can really survive that and I'll be you know we're gonna I want to see what this team looks like with Miranda right and you know I think that's the that's the light at the end of the tunnel for the Grizzlies and for Triple J's that I think getting ramped back will and what's all their issues but it'll make them a better more competitive team and that's that's all I could help Jaron Jackson would you drop Ben Simmons from IR to pick up Trey Murphy um  I mean I sure  and I mean in in a points League maybe not  because Murphy is a specialist and Specialists are not great for points leagues you want more well-rounded production and Ben Simmons is that but of course at the same time what if Ben Simmons he could be out a month and we'll get surprised you like will it be surprised if we never saw Ben Simmons again this season no not me so like that's your concern so to me this is kind of a category League it's more of a question and I would not blame you for dropping Ben Simmons in a point silly it would be harder for me to drop Simmons but I won't blame anybody  Mike Conley or Jalen green and a night category League I could tell you calmly is you know dramatically outpacing Jalen green so far with green the pluses have been the scoring which is still only at 18 a game I mean he was at 22 a game last season brought in some new faces you know Fred Van Fleet is playing like 40 minutes at night again that's not helping I I think you got to go Mike Conley right like is there is there a mid-season turnaround coming for Jalen green like I just I feel like he's like if the Rockets continued to play like 500 basketball I don't think they're ever going to just be like all right it's your time now Jalen green like that's that's kind of what he needs like he he knows me better off like being on the Blazers or something right now and like it's not it's not a bad player but I think he's a he's somebody who's impacting them more in real life than in fantasy and if category leaks like the field goal percentage is a killer I mean in nine cat you know he's still a relatively High turnover guy for not playing on the ball at tan I mean it's lower upside certainly with Conley but I think that's where I would lean that's the type of fantasy player that I am I would go calmly  I think so um  it's annoying with green because it's seems like he just can't string together five good games you just can't do it like you know he'll go for like he had a sixth stretch wherever average 25 a game then he follows up with nine and they're like okay well that's rough then he goes for 20 you're like okay just one bad game and then this game against La he goes for nine and you're like so what am I looking at here and like  there's not a lot pointing to him like saying that he should be better this season because usage rate slightly down basically the same as last season he's drawing more fouls which I think is really encouraging like his free throw away is is pretty high but  had my I might lean Conley honestly  yeah I I don't like it that's my answer but I think strictly for Fantasy it you know it might not add up real life wise but he's been a better player so far and I think as long as he stays healthy that probably continues all right we'll hit a few more questions in a moment but I'm gonna tell you about rival fantasy Lebron vs Jordan magic vs bird Barkley vs Mikhail basketball synonymous with

traded Steph Curry for Trey young in an assist to turnover League I assume that's that's included as a category was the same mistake or is this a good move  I'm muted now I'm not so I have to be honest because I  I've never played I'm gonna assist a turnover League I don't even know if we have the tools for that on RotoWire to like generate value I don't know how different it is that a nine category League  Kerry's been the 10th ranked player trade shooting has not been good enough  for him to reach those Heights but I think it can improve I I gotta be honest it might be a wash yeah I I don't fully know I analyzed it I'm sorry yeah interesting league for sure I actually am okay with the Trae young side of this you know his his assistant rate is about 12% Edge points higher than Currys his turnover rate is higher but only by about 3% Edge points so you know if you're if you're really worried about that specific category I actually think Trey young you might serve you better and he's also been way healthier than Curry he's younger you know I think the type of body that he has doesn't necessarily imply that he'd be durable but he's been super super durable so far and that's been you know part of the reason that Curry has been disappointing the last couple years is just miss games like when he's out there he's still awesome he's still easily a first round value but he's not that far ahead of Trey Young when they're both healthy and I think there's a pretty good chance that Curry misses significantly more time this year and Trey young so I don't think that's a mistake I think it's you know at worst it's probably a neutral or like maybe a movie that you slightly regret but I think that's a pretty good chance that pays off so I think you're fine doing that one  and I had to head points League Alex would you would you trade dear and fox and Kate Cunningham for curry and Zion  um I think I would rather  might rather be on the fox cage side of this but it would be like purely because of injury concern yeah um but you know points leagues trades are in my opinion very special a trade like this very straightforward in terms of like just add up their fantasy points and see which side has more and and that's it but that's if you of course believe that both sides have the same injury risk and whatnot and I assume that Korean Zion have higher fantasy points per game than Fox and Cade I'm cool with either side of this partially because there's an upside versus you know risk injury it depends how you feel about that sort of risk reward  it's a fun one Mark Williams or Walker Kessler rest of season had to head nine cat League I say Walker Kessler  I would maybe prefer Mark Williams to be honest yes you want to fight about it I but yeah of course like Kessler of course has like the blocks upside so if you need the blocks category if that fits your team build then get Kessler if you don't need the blocks and you're just chasing I think like basically you know points and rebounds I would go Mark Williams he just gets his shots are so much easier because lamelo sets him up for these Easy Like Dimes his free throw percentage I think projects to be better than Kessler's and he's playing more minutes when the team is not getting blown out  but it's a it's a good debate for sure  herb Jones and Camp Thomas for Jalen Williams and Albert asked will and William steals bounce back he's punting vehicle percentage rebounds blocks and turnovers so pretty aggressive build here in a nine Cat Head to Head League I you know I'm a sucker for Jayla Williams that's that's the guy I would want here you know Camp Thomas points are great the occasional threes are great the free throws but I don't I that's a variables there that I'm a little worried about and obviously herb Joe's will be impacted when Trey Murphy comes back when the call comes back so I would prefer the jail and Williams side of this I think I think I would too if you're asking specifically about a steals I think they will come back I just I did the quick Google mba.com Advanced stats page for his deflections he's actually averaging one more deflection per game this season than last season  so theoretically he should actually finish this season with more steals than he did last year despite being lower so I think it's just bad luck for him right now so I don't think you have to be worried about that  all right we'll hit a few more here try to be out at about the hour mark 12 team wrote a league should I swap shade and sharp for Russell Westbrook  so  Rondo makes this difficult because we know about West Brooks issues but he's actually been decent this year partially because he's taking so few free throws that the person is just not killing you  which hey maybe that that continues I actually think I would rather have Westbrook here I have expressed concerns about sharp in the past because he is right now like he's ranked first of all right now in eight cat he's ranked below Westbrook but he's dead so he's been doing that in 3738 minutes a game when scoot comes back when Simon comes back when Brogden comes back he might go back to seeing the 28 minutes he saw an opening night  and he's also just not a very good pastor  um I think I would rather have Westbrook yeah  yeah reluctantly I probably agree I mean I do worry that these last couple of games for us have been a little rough and he played 17 minutes off the bench against Houston and the other night that was his first game coming off the bench after he you know so selflessly as a leader and a veteran voice on the team you know offered to to come off the bench I don't think he's gonna play some teammates every night but I think he could play like 22 to 25 minutes and at that point it becomes pretty complicated but you know Shane sharp is is killing you just as much in a lot of the percentage categories right now so yeah I think you might just kind of take the known assets in Russell Westbrook rather than kind of chanting on chain sharp once the Blazers get a little bit healthier  nice trade here by Johnny who says I traded away Chris Paul for Mark Williams  I like that deal I think that's the right move you won congrats congratulations you won the deal I mean Chris Paul I still don't mind like hanging on to him and just kind of take it what you get but I don't think there's any sort of breakout coming for Chris Paul I think we if he was gonna have some big games that would have happened without Curry and it really didn't so yeah good job getting the Mark Williams side there Miguel asked what are our thoughts on John Collins for the future you know college has been okay so far this season Jazz have just been a really weird team night tonight you know they're one of the worst defensive teams in the league they're always involved in these like you know 128 134 type of games but college has been really consistent 15 points nine rebounds one block per game hitting about 1.63 is per game on the year that's been a little bit higher lately in general though you know he's just been like a little bit better than he was in Atlanta the big thing that was the 3-point shooting seems like it's back like he had really dropped off last season he was under 30% from three he's not going to shoot 45% on the year but he's probably also not going to shoot 29 so yeah I mean as long as you're being realistic and kind of expecting him to continue doing what he's doing I think that could happen I don't think he's ever going to be you know the guy that we thought he was like year three in Atlanta when he was like a top 40 fantasy player that feels like it's out of the cards at this point but you know I think the Jazz kind of rolled the dice and just said yeah well we'll take a distressed asset we'll see you know  only 26 you know somebody that they could consider part of their future so I wouldn't really worry about him losing minutes later on you know if they go into more of a tank So my answer would just be its sustainable what he's doing now but probably not anymore it's a it's a slight bump with with Kessler out as in terms of rebounds and blocks but I think you'll finish as a top 100 player yeah  yeah  all right  lamelo Jaren Jackson and kuzma  or Jalen Brunson Desmond Bane use of nurkic and Zach Collins at a points League  it's I I'm always shocked when it's how many people are in League where there's like trades going down that are like three guys for three guys or three guys for four guys I feel like relatively speaking my my legs have no trades  I think I would  rather have the lamelo and triple Jesus side here but again you're kind of getting into that murky spot where it's like you're you're just adding all these points up together and none of these guys really project  I don't think to be I think the only guy who projects to actually be worse  rest of season would probably be Bane just because of Morant coming back and it points League  I mean nurkic College are definitely roster Bowl guys I don't think they're like streamers so I think I would just write I think I would just keep who you have honestly okay we'll hit two or three more and then we'll be out of here another trade question Alex would you trade to Rosen and siakam for Devin Booker Russell Westbrook and Markle fultz  no DeRose against yakim are gonna average like 30 to 45 fantasy points for you and a given week so yeah  I I like the framework of this because like if it's somebody that I'm like thinking about trying to get off of I would I want to a better second piece than Westbrook at Foltz you know even if it's just one player instead of two like I don't think you're wrong to want to necessarily sell either those guys but you know Booker's the best player in the deal and that's big but you need somebody or two players that are a little bit better than the Westbrook and folds let's see  talk a little bit about Kula Bali and Sohan I don't think we need to go back there should I trade Josh giddey for Jordan Poole category League hunting turnovers and field goal percentage so I suppose in that format pool becomes a little more appealing  he becomes very appealing in that format because those are those are the things he sucks the most that but no I don't I don't think I would do it I mean pool should be playing better but they don't seem to really care like they're not throwing them out they're like 36 minutes a game regardless of outcome or anything like that and I think giddy actually projects to play better throughout much of the year so I would rather have giddy but I understand how this trade for your specific team build especially if you're not winning the categories that you're trying to win might be appealing but it would be a tough trade for me to to actually do yeah I'd rather have giddy I mean there's that report over the weekend that you know the Wizards already don't feel like Jordan pools part of their future you know that just doesn't sound like a team that's like I want to get it back on track I mean he scored over 20 points once and the last 10 games he's averaging 28 minutes in that span you know again if you're punching turnovers the field goal percentage I get it it could be appealing but I just I think we might just be looking back in a month or two and like the entire fantasy Community is just gonna have to kind of take a lap on Jordan Poole it's just it doesn't look like it's gonna work out  Paul asked my opponent has eight more games than me this week is it a good move to drop kcp and Ty's Joan's to open up daily streaming spots to get more games in the idea of that is is good but both those guys have four game weeks this week so you know I wouldn't I wouldn't drop those two specifically if you got if you got some players on two-game weeks then yes but you know unless unless we're not looking at is inaccurate which it's on RotoWire so it can't be both Washington and ever have four games so probably not you know I don't unless there's like way higher upside guys out there which they're probably aren't I would keep those two just because they're you know they're not the ones that are hurting you in terms of games  what you are looking at I believe is correct yeah don't don't don't drop them because you're like Nick said those guys have four games  as I am Ben Thompson worth the stash that's his brothers doing well we address this a little bit earlier I probably not you know unless you unless you are in a deeply with a bunch of bench spots maybe I just don't  yeah I don't I don't really think there's going to be opportunity there I would say probably not worth the stash yeah I'd rather I'd rather stream that spot even once he's back and we'll finish out with this Mark Williams or a sar Thompson rest of season interesting one  that is interesting  I don't  I actually take a sar to be honest with you you know as much as I  programmed me prefers we talked about Mark Williams versus Walker Kessler I think that's a watch depending on your league settings are Thompson man I mean he's giving you his the numbers that are is giving you are really not that different than what Mark Williams is telling you right so it's like it really  really it just comes down to the field goal percentage versus the defensive stats because Thompson's a one the best defenders in the league already it's just like a field goal percentage stocks because he can't shoot a basketball and so I think I would rather have a sar to be on his yeah they're strangely comparable like you said if the field goal percentage is in need then go Mark Williams but a star Topps and has more blocks than Mark Williams and the other basically the same in terms of points and rebounds you know toxic gives you a little bit more as a passer you know 2.8 steals of blocks per game is fantastic and I don't think that's slowing down anytime soon they're even comparable at the free throw line as well so I would I would give a lean to to and that's situation all right guys we gotta wrap it up here as always we appreciate everybody jumping in
