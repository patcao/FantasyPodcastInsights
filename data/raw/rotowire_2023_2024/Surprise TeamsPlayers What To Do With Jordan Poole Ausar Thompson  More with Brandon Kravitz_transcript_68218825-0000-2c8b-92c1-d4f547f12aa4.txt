welcome to a Wednesday edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast we are in week four of the regular season Nick Whalen braided Kravitz here with you as we are every Wednesday and Friday what a night we had in and I believe what night three of the NBA in season tournament I am still kind of scrambling trying to like find okay which teams are still in play right now for the NBA cup I believe the Clippers were mathematically eliminated last night's with their loss to the Denver Nuggets but an exciting night of group play we had you know one big kerfuffle going on in the Timberwolves Warriors game what's the two minutes in Klay Thompson gets kicked out Draymond Green comes in for the headlock got Rudy gobert he gets ejected as well you know Anthony Davis was nearly ejected in the Lakers game look we will we wondered if players would take the in-season cup seriously and I think we have our answer Brandon the only people that are laughing at this right now are trolling fans it's honestly been a lot of fun and I don't know if you saw Steph Curry's response when he was asked like how confusing is all of this and and he just kind of snarkily goes you know if you just read about it it's really not that difficult you're in a group stage you try and pick up enough wins to advance and then it's it's an a knockout tournament and it really is I mean when you break it down it's this is not that complicated and these players  first of all there's money on the line 500,000 dollars at the end for the champion even if it's just 5% more interesting and competitive than a basic Tuesday or Friday night game in the NBA isn't that all you're kind of asking for and so when you change the color of the courts and the jerseys are different and you tell the players even if it's sort of like this pot of gold or maybe bronze would be a better comparison of pot of bronze at the end of the rainbow players they just we dog these guys way too much as NBA fans is saying they don't care there's so many guys that care so much that are Uber competitive and they only need a little more soul of added motivation to give us what we saw last night full-blown so I don't know how much motivation dream on green needs to show somebody else but I mean this is been obviously a victory early on for the NBA is my overarching point I do I mean do you really think the in-season tournament is what provoked you know this this increased level of aggression I guess to put it professionally last night like I I think that was gonna happen no matter what I don't think you know Anthony Davis said hey it's easy tournament you know I got I got a shove Santi aldama here or you know I don't think Klay Thompson said bad two minutes into the in-season tournament you know game two look I gotta turn it up a notch I think it just happened to be that he's a terrific games but either way it's in general good for the league you know I think Adam Silver would probably tell you know it's not good that we have players getting kicked out but I think the fact that this happened to occur during an in season tournament I did it shines more light on it I don't think that they fought because they're in the in season tournament my general point is just that players are way more naturally competitive than I think we tend to give them credit for and that's where the in-season tournament can be something that these players care about it because they already have that and it's that sort of just natural competitiveness that we're gonna get into scuffles throughout the course of seasons and Draymond Green has done this to teammates in practice so we shouldn't be surprised that it's happening on a Tuesday night against an opponent but I just I think that you are seeing an increased level of competitiveness in general the aggression probably not because of n Season tournament play but just overall we've seen close games we've seen good games the we I think we've read the stat on last week's podcast that first night of in season tournament action saw more one score games then we'd seen in years on a slate that had  at least seven games so there's clearly something to this all right let's hit some of the news coming out yesterday and looking ahead to the rest of the week and we'll start with golden state and you know they were going to be without Steph Curry no matter what last night you know Draymond has like a history of if he's not playing with curry he just doesn't want to be out there so I'm not not shocked that he got kicked out of this game you know less than two minutes in I would have gone over on that but nonetheless you know they're calling Curry you know calling this a minor injury but they they're also calling it a right Dane which yeah that's not bad that those are kind of contradictory to me right and you know Curry was on the bench she was up and you know didn't look like he was hampered at all didn't appear to be you know wearing any braces or anything on that knee so I mean to believe the Warriors here that this is not that big of a deal but we're also talking about a guy in his mid-30s who's missed a ton of time with a variety of injuries over the last several years and I don't know man like in general like knee sprained is not just like a one to two game injury like that's that's usually something that keeps guys out for weeks if not longer so are you are you concerned right now about Stuff Curry like you expect to see him tomorrow against OKC Saturday in the rematch against OKC like how are we handled this right now for Fantasy so the report is that it's not that serious of an injury right now to me that means no more than a week but yeah I expect him to miss the next couple of games and I see here on our itinerary teams that we got wrong this is one that's on the opposite end for me the and there are plenty don't worry we'll put plenty of egg on my face but we talked about it on the first podcast we did together I was concerned about this Warriors team getting old right in front of our very eyes and then they started the season pretty hot and and it was looking great at first trying to end the dynasty verbally here on the podcast for the Golden State Warriors but we are seeing it Klay Thompson wasn't the same player last year Steph Curry now dealing with injuries and if he's out that's going to Crater the productivity of the team they go as he goes and if he's not out on the floor I don't think Chris Paul is going to keep them  afloat I kind of some bizarre possessions I thought by Chris Paul down the stretch I mean ended up being a really competitive game against Minnesota and we'll talk about Brandon pajewski in a moment here but even after the ejections you're thinking okay all right Minnesota's gonna run away with this thing they still have gobert they got towns they got Edwards and that wasn't really the case they're actually trailing going into the fourth quarter got some big stops Anthony Edwards did a big pull up three late in the game but I thought Chris Paul had several opportunities to I don't know if I'd say take over this game but at least kind of take control the offense and he was he was passing I'm like why don't open mid-range jumpers and you know kind of kicking it out to guys who you maybe don't necessarily want taking big shots down the stretch I thought it was kind of a bizarrely passive game for Chris Paul considering the Warriors did not have dream on Curry or Klay Thompson for virtually the entire game but the thing with the gold with the Warriors right now Brandon is they're just not shooting the ball well right and you know obviously when you remove Curry from the equation that's gonna make it even more difficult but they're under 35% from three as a team on the season they're 44.5% from the field that's 26 in the NBA the only teams worse than the warrior so far the Bulls the Blazers the Grizzlies and the Knicks and you know part of that is Andrew Wiggins just looking like a shell of himself yeah you're not relying heavily on Andre Mont green to give you anything offensively you know Chris Paul's been up and down but there's always this you know fabled belief that like all right this is the year Jonathan kaminga Moses booty those guys are gonna take over it feels like we're going down the same path with those guys again and you know now we have created pajam ski who looks like he might be at least something for this team Off the Bench but I also don't think you can count on him you know going nine of 18 from the field banking in a three at the end of the third quarter I mean that felt like you know kind of one of those like magical almost Jeremy Lin type of games and you know I think they'll experiment and see what they have with him but ultimately you know they they flashed a graphic last night branded that I did not realize this Brandon pajewski became only the second Warriors player to score over 20 points this season obviously Stephen Curry the other one and it Dario sorry I ended up getting over 20 points as well he had a late three-pointer so the Warriors now have three 20 point scorers on the year Steph Curry Brandon pajami and Dario saric  wow yeah I mean I think that we oftentimes are fooled by jerseys and sports and don't let the Jersey full you in this situation just because you're donning the Warriors Garb doesn't mean that you're all the sudden a proficient 3-point shooter playtime is a dropped off a bit I mean he was still a great three-point shooter last year so I don't want a dog him too much but like you said you're not getting much from dream on green we take Stuff Curry out of the equation Who Do You Love in terms of outside shooting on this team a team that for the last decade has been excellent at that and almost clean across the board with guys that they would bring in and Shuffle into their lineup that's just not their those young guys have not come around and hey maybe this pajam ski fella is somebody we should take a good hard look at because they're going to need production of Stuff Curry ends up missing some time here and 23 points and it's not like he was doing it all on flukey 3's 9 of 18 from the field so six six of his shots came from inside the perimeter I like that in terms of just his ability to score at multiple levels  this is a first round pick he was a top 20 guy and I'm not highly heralded coming out of college but clearly something that that Steve Curran company saw on him  Wisconsin native Brandon pigeons oh yeah what else do you need to know um yeah I think Andrew Wiggins struggles to me are maybe the biggest concern so far like I think Clay is gonna get going we saw slow start from him last year you know dream on like the numbers are never gonna look great but obviously what he gives them is tough to quantify and I think he's gonna be fine but we can just five for 33 from three to begin the season and he just he just doesn't look confident man he doesn't look engaged she's just kind of floating around out there we saw that again last night had some lapses on the defensive end like it's just I don't know what's going on with Wiggins like he just were 12 games in it at this point you know if it was three four five games they're like all right you know could just be a slope but he looks like he's lost confidence across the board like he said he's at 50% from the free throw line he's at 39% from the field like it's not like it's just a three-point issue like he's not he's not hitting anything right now he's not even taking that many you know last night was was kind of one of those spots where it's like all right you're down hey you're down you're three best players for the entire game like this would be the night for Andrew Wiggins to step up and he just simply did not and it's got to the point where you know if you're in a 10 or 12 Team league I don't think I've dropping Andrew Wiggins because I think the pedigree is there and I do think over the course of the Season he's somebody that you want to roster but if you have anything less than a four four game week right now it's like I don't even know if I want to start Andrew Wiggins  no I mean and there's a number of these guys I'm sure that at some point Jordan Poole is one of the most confounding players in fantasy and his name will probably come up at some point Andrew Wiggins fits into the same bucket of LED boot players on your roster that are too good to drop and too bad to start and we end up with a lot of these players I don't understand what's happening this guy's put on a lot of muscle over the last several years and I think he's somebody that should be attacking the basket a lot more but when you look forget about the free throw percentage which is certainly not great at less than 50% he's not even getting to the line Nick that's part of the problem I mean maybe he would make him if he got there but I mean he shot no free throws last night four in the two games combined prior to that this is a guy that should be getting to the cup and forcing the issue with his physicality and he's not doing that at all so you're right and I think that that speaks to a confidence issue when you're passively just just taking advised mid-range or three-point shots and they're not falling the best players when that's happening in their field goal percentage or 3-point percentage is sluggish they attack the rim especially if they have the ability to do it he does and he's not doing it so it does speak to that confidence issue and and that's where it's tough to gauge because I mean confidence is everything in basketball and you have no idea as a fantasy manager when that's ever going to come back  got a question about Jaron Jackson Jr from from a friend Mal and this little this will kind of lead us to talk about Grizzlies Lakers and the Grizzlies are certainly a team that I got wrong I know I wouldn't say I thought they were gonna win the west or anything like that I did not think they'd be too annoying Brandon same with the worst record in the Western Conference through 11 games and you know they have just they've been back competitive on a lot of nights and you know they're down Steven Adams their down job around we know that you know I think those are those are kind of their own issues but some of the depth that they lost as well you know Titus Jones for example like not having him to cut it cover up for the absence of job or to I think that's been a much bigger Factor than we anticipated you know they lost Marcus Smart to an injury last night look like he rolled his ankle in the second quarter so we'll see how much time he ends up missing but this one gets the Lakers got completely out of hand I mean this game was over essentially by half-time and you know the lake LeBron Anthony Davis didn't even play at all in the fourth quarter it was yet another night excuse me my voice is just all over the place it was another night where I feel like everybody in my my most important fantasy league like started the night over five from the field looking at you Jared Jackson Who Is Now down to like 44% on the year he was over seven at one point finished three of 16 from the floor so I was the same thing happened with Laurie marketing Damian Lillard has on that team he's shooting like 36% from the field on the year I thought this would be a monster situation early on for Jared Jackson you know without without java Ranch coming off the Team USA you're thinking all right I just gonna be it's gonna be the Bane show it's gonna be the Jared Jackson show every single night and you know Jared Jackson is now had three straight games where he just hasn't really done anything offensively you know the rebounds are not really there at all he is not had multiple block shots in five straight games you know I was one of my highest buys this was an auction league and it's looking I wouldn't say like it's gonna be a total bus because you know the big games are still been there like Jackson not a nice three game Run  yeah at the beginning in November but two of those games came against Portland and it feels like when they go up again you know some of the elite teams in the league they're just over matched I mean the Grizzlies make no sense right now I and perhaps it's just as simple as this sometimes like we think that what a great player leaves the floor that it then opens up Rome an opportunity for other really good players like Jaron Jackson Jr but this is a big man that clearly needs his point guard to play that two-man game I don't think he's the same without John Moran we saw spurts last season when jaw was off the floor where this team still played well but that's where you get a team that's that's good that's rolling go back to that confidence word that we were using before that can rally the troops there's no rallying right now they know they're down a road where they had to play without John Morant their best player for 25 games and it's just something that seems like nobody's stepping up and it's not clicking right now but I would hold on on Jaren Jackson Jr if we're talking about between the two just positionally it's harder to replace Jaron Jackson Jr you already 11 games  into the jawless Grizzlies I think Jerry Jackson junior we just all read the situation wrong we thought he'd be better without jaw he clearly needs John the lineup and that's coming you're I mean you're a couple weeks away from the Grizzlies returning to full full form and strength yeah I think you're right I think you said it that he kind of needs job around to function he's not he's not the type of guy who's going to just go get his own shot right I think exactly it was kind of ironic watching him go up against Anthony Davis last night and like like Jared Jackson last night looked like Anthony Davis on his bad you know where he's kind of out of control he's the legs are all over the place he's like trying to draw contact but it ends up just being messy and he's forcing shots like that's that's kind of what it reminded me of and it's those nights when like when the Lakers don't have LeBron and it's like all right add we need you to give us 30 sometimes he could do it sometimes you can't and you know I think more often than not that's what we've seen with Jackson we got a couple of questions you know one here Kate Cunningham kind of in the same boat Andrew has the same thing is he a Bi-Lo Mal asks if you should trade Kate cutting ham I feel the same way on cage as I do Jaron Jackson I feel like we've seen we've seen the the highs with Kate cutting ham last night was certainly not one of those games but he ranked 75th right now in per game value in eight category League's you know we still gave you  12 assists gave you three steals last night you know the shooting is is what's kind of holding him back and if you played in nine cat League you know turnovers have been somewhat of an issue for him as well but you should 40.2% from the field but is that 88% from the line you know 1.83 is per game I'd be looking to buy low on Kate Cunningham like if it's if it's a you know do I try to trade a versus do I try to trade for him I would rather buy low on Kate I agree I still think his best days are in front of them and and I just like to reiterate in terms of the Jaron Jackson Jr situation I think at this point I'd still rather have Jared and Jackson Jr but if we're just isolating Cade Cunningham a bylaw yeah I mean I would go ahead and see what you can pull off to to get him all eyes are on a sar Thompson right now he is the I mean is this guy not the fantasy darling last week was all about Scotty Barnes and what he was doing for Fantasy managers but a start Thompson is not going away and so everybody that's got their eyes on the Pistons has their eyes firmly planted on him but I think we live in a in a world where both of those guys can exist and have their own fantasy value on the same roster they just do different things the SARS bringing it across the board the guys just statistically defense offense and everything and Cade Cunningham is going to fill it up with more like points and assists yeah it's our top student is the you know the the auction buy or the the draft pick of the year so far and probably I think he's benefiting from the absence of Jalen Duren in terms of the rebounds like I don't think he's gonna be a like you know 14 rebounds a game guy when during his back but it's clear I mean he's gonna stick in this rotation right it's like Jane I know the defense is too good you can't get away from them he's unbelievable on defense yeah I mean I feel like we didn't really get a fair chance to evaluate him you know in the overtime League last year but my goodness I mean this dude is is unbelievable it's like he's a great Oddball Defender and it's also translating to fantasy like that's not always the case right there's a lot of like good Defenders who just don't get a ton of steals or blocks whereas our tops it feels like he's good for like at least one of each every night I mean these last four games 12 points 13 boards giving you almost four assists as well that was not really something that we you know we would be consistent coming in 1.8 blocks one steal so yeah he's a top 50 guy on the year so far obviously if you're if you're someone who grabbed him late you're holding out to him we got a question about Herbert Jones to see a musk roster over tie his Jones no relation or Bruce Brown he's definitely a bus roster for me for sure over Bruce Brown I mean you could you could kind of quibble about Ty's Jones like I'm still I'm still holding out some hope there you know he had 10 points eight assists the other night against Toronto that was a step in the right direction but the minutes have been all over the place I would rather have herb Jones right now of those three the question is you know do they pull back on herb Jones at some point like Trey Murphy could be back in the next couple of weeks you know obviously CJ McCollum is out we don't really know when he's gonna be back Jose Alvarado like not one to one positionally but yeah I think heard Jones is just such a good three a d player such a good Defender that yes Trey Murphy is going to cut into his workload but I think New Orleans needs to keep him on the floor for at least 25 plus minutes a night and if that's the case he's still probably getting you one or two steals every night he's gonna get you some blocks as well I mean he had seven combined Steals and blocks and 31 minutes and what turned into a blowout last night against Dallas so absolutely want him over Bruce Brown and I think he had to take him over ties Joe's too I think I'd rather have ties Jones if we're just talking about over the course of the season but I agree I mean I really like herb Jones the player the problem is is that we don't I don't think we have a true depiction of what this New Orleans Pelicans wrote in his gonna look like because we just haven't seen them fully healthy at any point this season so he's a player that I like but the Washington Wizards have very few adults in the room tyus Jones feels like one of them so even though the numbers aren't I popping I just think over the course of the Season he's gonna bring you more efficiency a higher usage they've got to get away from Jordan Poole I'm probably not telling the Wizards anything that they can't figure out for themselves and and that is certainly one of my big swings and misses in the draft process yeah yeah I was targeting Jordan Poole and didn't really get him anywhere kind of feels like a bullet dodged and that situation and you know just in the last week There's been like multiple videos somebody put together like a low lights compilation of Jordan Poole just do in Jordan Poole things you know there's that video of him just like very clearly not paying attention yeah pulling off coaches blowing off teammates in the Huddle it's like we're three and a half weeks into the season don't really love that as far as what it means going forward but and I would I wouldn't read into that if he didn't all so play like someone that didn't pay attention and in huddles  that's the problem yeah let's let's talk about your team the Orlando Magic last night they get blown out by Brooklyn 124 104 I was still a decent night for bad Cairo and Franz Bogner you know go go badass still starting still giving you okay numbers and relief of Wendell Carter and anything that you saw last night or over these last couple of games for more Lando I know you followed that was closely as anybody oh yeah well the cratered in the fourth quarter which has been one of the biggest problems for this team but you know that's aside from the fantasy lens I thought that we would see more from Anthony black in terms of numbers he wasn't a guy that I was high on in the fantasy draft process because I didn't think you would see minutes but he's impressed the team so much in practice and and in the preseason that when markelle fultz went down they slid him right into the starting lineup but man does this guy Fade Into the background I think he looks comfortable out there but he just doesn't doesn't handle the ball all that off and he is not like he's a guy that to me passes the eye test but then you look at the box score and and he's giving you virtually nothing so even with Mark helps out of the lineup I don't even think that Anthony black is Ross roster bull loved what I've seen from Jalen Suggs on the offensive end last night was not one of those nights and he's going to be hot and cold that's just the kind of player that he is but in terms of what he brings defensively and  when you get those random bursts on offense I think Jalen Suggs is somebody that I probably should have been higher on in the draft process Franz is Franz um you know you brings you this yeah he's the same guy every single night it's great for Pollo you know I I think the the shooting percentage will get there one of the things that I'm noticing with him is that he has not figured out where his kill spot is yet he doesn't know where to go on the floor to go I need a bucket I'm gonna go I'm gonna shoot it from here this is still somebody that wants to be a good 3-point shooter last night he was shot over 50% from the perimeter but that's not who he is I just don't think he's found his spot yet Paulo is a perfect example of the type of player that's much better in real life than he is in fantasy definitely helps this team in the win loss department but he's just not somebody like it's even a top 50 fantasy player at this point so that's where I think fantasy and reality can definitely there can be a Divergent there it's a couple of quick questions from the chat here Sohan or Bruce Brown in a 14 team 9 category League I would go Bruce Brown I'm kind of out on this Sohan experiment especially in Nyan Cat you know your deal with the turnovers that if you look at sohan's ranking and ate cat versus Nyan Cat there's a pretty big difference we're talking like 40 50 spots because of the turnovers Bruce Brown's been pretty underwhelming you know he hasn't had any like big stat lines but that's that's just who Bruce Brown is like he is a he's a bit player he's more he's more valuable in real life than he is in fantasy but I think in a night category League Bruce Brown as a better chance to finish in that like 90 to 11:10 range that Jeremy so hot does at this point it's actually at the Spurs move away from this point guard experiment at some point right it's like it's the assistant you're a better kind of bowing him right now and I could see San Antonio wanting to go with a more traditional guard they have trade Jones just kind of sit there so I would lean Bruce Brown and that situation yeah we're starting to see his minutes dip a little bit too I agree I think it's something they go away from he's not a great player and this team just man when they play bad it is like otherworldly bad 87 points last night against the Oklahoma they had 83 a couple weeks ago against the Los Angeles Clippers so they have that what they can crater in a way that I'm sort of at the point where I'm trying to avoid all Spurs not named Victor Webb minyama just because I don't want the the full blown dud there's so many players and fantasy that can that can just give you night tonight production and and there are so many guys on the on the Spurs that just give you nothing he's one of them  so he talked about Jordan Poole we won't go long on this one but you know Gilford asked any suggestions what to do with this clouds outside of the top 100 so far this season I mean he was dry I saw him going in the top 40 you know 38 to like 45 that a lot of drafts yeah man I mean what are you doing I was one of I was so high on him I thought for sure the usage was gonna Skyrocket it was gonna be Jordan pool ball and yet here the Washington Wizards are trying to actually coach a basketball team I thought it was just gonna be Sandlot ball this yeah pick up at the white the YMCA and I mean he's he's trying to play his own brand of basketball and credit to the Wizards because they're not having it and they shouldn't Jordan Poole we are learning was a product of the system and the system was in Golden State and honestly they need each other because golden state is struggling to score outside of the obvious stars and Jordan Poole is struggling with out real structure he thinks he's a superstar he's simply not what do you do with him you hold them hold them on your bench and sorry you could put them on the trade block but whose making you an offer for Jordan Poole right now and he's good to drop yeah I feel like this is my like Alibaba stock that I bought in like 2019 and I'm just like waiting for it to eventually Skyrocket and I don't know if that's gonna happen yeah and if that's the thing is if you're trading him I mean it's it's rock bottom it feels like right now I would probably hold off and just hope that that he has like a hot week which will probably come at some point right I mean there's gonna be a week where he has back-to-back 30 point games maybe at that point that's  when you try to to sell relatively high on him but if you're selling them right now I mean what do you what are you getting back it's like I'm looking at other players in his General range just like are you trading him for I don't know Devin vassell or you know you try to get someone like Jeremy Grant to spend a better score but it's not really giving you anything else you can Target try to look at like other under John Collins is like hanging around like the top 100 I mean these are the type of guys we're talking like you're not you're not getting somebody else who was being drafted in that same range no but I'm also you know most scenarios I think philosophically and fantasy I agree with you you don't want to you don't want to sell low but it could actually get worse  so I don't think it's the worst idea to just see if you can if you can get something if there's some player out there that intrigues you that's that's around the range that Nick was just talking about in most scenarios I would say that's a really bad idea and it's and it's a panic move I I truly think this situation might not improve itself so if you have somebody you have to know that that other fantasy manager is looking and saying I believe that that turn around is coming and if you can get that sort of value on Jordan Poole that might be the only value that's really left is somebody that that really thinks that like if they think they're ripping you off then that might be the person you want to make a deal with  all right good trade question here from Jacob so he's saying Jayson Tatum a sour Thompson and Jalen Duren for LeBron Myles Turner and Kris porzingis in a pointless League which side would you rather have Tatum a sore Thompson enduring for LeBron Myles Turner and Chris Taps porzingis boy that is a heavy hitter blockbuster trade I think I'd rather have the first part I don't I'm not trying to trade a sar Thompson right now Tatum is is great  yeah no I think I'm keeping I think I'm keeping Tatum Thompson and endurance  yeah I feel the same way I'm on that side for sure LeBron's been fantastic so far it's just he looks like the same guy from the last few years and you do Wonder at some point is he missing 15 to 20 games is that injury coming you know he's dealing with the calf thing of late I actually thought LeBron looked better last night that he had at any point this year terms of aggression confidence like some of the the shop making like he was he looked like kind of you know 2015 LeBron I thought at times with the the athleticism and the way that he was going at that Grizzlies defense so there's gonna be nights where he was a little more passive and the age shows up so I understand you know the appeal with LeBron but yeah it supports like a specialty I think that's where a star Topps is gonna have a little bit more value long term that's where you know the the three the lack of Threes the the free throw percentage aren't gonna hurt you and Jael Duran too I mean obviously rebounds matter in points League's and you know I think that's what I want Jayson Tatum is also the steadiest player in fantasy basketball where I was well I mean LeBron Myles Turner and Christopher's I guess all such a time right so I think I think you have I think you have more upside with Thompson Duran and Tatum and I also think you have a higher floor so for me that one's pretty easy I think if you're gonna get into the business of trading a sar Thompson you trade him by himself and you bring in a star player and and like you really try and it do you what kind of player do you think you can get in return or complement of players if you trade a sar Thompson by himself  that's a good question I mean it's so hard to say who might just be available I mean so you're saying he's exciting right now like we do you do have to consider that he could be we think he's steady but that's all so baked into his value in a trade is that somebody that's making a move on him doesn't think that they're getting fleeced and so you can get a little bit more for him  yeah I mean are we talking like do you target someone like like a  yeah um and see how comes coming off of another great game and it's seems like he's turned things around but maybe somebody who was scared off by the early season struggles  I still feel like I'd rather have a sore Thompson but that that sort of my point is that the fact that that's where we are mentally with us our Thompson means it might be a good sell High Point yeah I think you know in general I want to I want to Target you know guys who have that pedigree who might be off to a slow start you know you're obviously selling high on us our tops and you're probably buying low on someone like caca um so yeah I mean I'm not saying for sure that it's our Thompson is gonna fall off at any point like who knows and it right now he's not an appealing player to trade but certainly something that I would consider just just given you know the fact that there would be kind of a buying frenzy on him all right well but my guy Pollo sure yeah I'm fine with that I mean I think Palace played fine I think the fantasy ranking maybe doesn't quite reflect that you know the three-point shooting is gonna be up and down but that's that's somebody that I would I would rather have at this point just for for the relative security we got a question here on Mark Williams thoughts on Mark Williams Clifford is playing with his minutes too much do you think Miles Bridges impacts in when he's back yeah the miles bridge is huge we should just address that in general he could return as early as this this Friday that's the Hornets next game and all indications are that that's going to be the case you know Steve Clifford even said you know he's gonna have a big role right away they seem to be just kind of leaning head first into this they play Friday and Saturday in a back-to-back and it's tough to say right now because the Hornets have a ton of injuries so we don't know if Terry Rozier Gordon Hayward Brandon Miller any of those guys are gonna be available on Friday so we might we might not get like a perfect look at Miles Bridges role right away but you know in terms of Mark Williams specifically it's like  in a roundabout way his role could be affected because if we're seeing more miles Bridges at the three or the four maybe that means that we see more PJ Washington at the five so I think Miles Bridges you know I think there's like three or four players on this roster who get ultimately impact let's say you I wouldn't be so confident that Miles Bridges comes right back into the starting lineup I think that's that's sort of where I'm at he hasn't played basketball in a while and Steve Clifford is a hard-nosed old school coach she got to earn your minutes back with a guy like that and I think that's part of the reason why it can be frustrating for Fantasy managers because you look at players that say this guy's clearly better than that guy I remember so vividly when he was coaching the magic it would drive magic fans crazy because he would rather than trying to get Mo Bamba up to speed which in hindsight now turns out he was completely right about bomb but at the time you thought this was a big with all this upside and he kept playing Kim Burch over him it was it was maddening but that's the kind of coach that he is if you're not giving him production and you have an earned your minutes then you're not going to be on the floor miles Bridges has to earn his way back so I wouldn't freak out about it even though he's gonna make his way back I don't think it's gonna be that impactful right out of the gate we're still  talking about a player looking back at three games ago 204 rebounds against the Washington Wizards I mean that's not the kind of guy you want to get away from too much no no not necessarily I kind of wish I would have had more Mark Williams honestly given the start that he's been off to I didn't I didn't really love what I saw last year I thought he was he looked like a little slow but he looks more athletic to be looks more confident early this season and you know unfortunately we got a question here from from Aunt you know Nick Richards is somebody I've been streaming in a couple weeks over the last couple of weeks I think he's somebody that maybe not dropped fully from the rotation but I think we see his his impact muted a little bit going forward as well and asked you know if I have to drop one of these guys at a category league would you drop this back by Nick Richards or go go to say The Big Three  the mean it does get much bigger than that if we're being honest I mean you're the Nick Richards guys so I'll leave that one for you bismarck's been playing some good basketball  yeah I think I'm I think I'm dropping Goga I know our guy can cry it's over spent for him and  you know on the Fab but Wendell Carter Junior should be making his way back relatively soon at least within the next couple of weeks I just don't think goes gonna give you that much more and more Wagner at these in playing so well I wouldn't be surprised if they made that switch as well in the starting lineup yeah I've never been a huge Go-Go guy I know some of the permit numbers look okay going back to his days and in Indiana when it felt like he was like a game time call for every single game that he ever played and you know when Del Carter's not going to be out that long so I never really was all in on bitossi it's not like we're looking at like a four-month injury here I think he fooled people with the block shots in that first game right out of the gate that's not really who he is  yeah exactly exactly I was It was kind of the perfect scenario to force people to overspend on him in Fab all right we got a couple Messengers to to pass along from some of our sponsors if I can actually locate the Reeds here

Showdown yeah it was anything but not only did OKC run away with the game they win by 36 I was really never all that competitive you know got out of hand in the third quarter but props to our guy out with Rutha you know on the the RotoWire NBA Show on Sirius XM NBA Radio last night he handed out a check home to outscore Victor weapon Yama bet at two to one and yeah didn't really cash or the way that we thought chat homegrown 9 points on three of ten shooting Victor weapon Yamaha eight points on 415 hey when is a win that was I've noticed there have been a lot of disappointing moments really ever since we get that whiff of the Phenom version of Victor one banana when he went up against Kevin Durant and it made all the headlines and he had that monster stat line we've seen women Jama and some other spots in Prime Time situations with the spotlight on them  and he hasn't really shown up so I think I'm officially out of the business of the Spurs being appointment television and when banana can kind of just become part of my league pass rotation with everybody else there were there were better options last night to say the least ah yeah it was too good to be true you know and this is this is something that's gonna happen with the Spurs right I mean they're they've been blown out a ton of times already and you know webinars still has like three wild plays every night even on what felt like a disaster night for him he had a ton of 14 rebounds he had like six in the first couple of minutes because there were so many missed shots here but unfortunately not too many takeaways from that game specifically let's get back to the chat here we got some good questions coming in  is Spencer Dinwiddie a must roster this is interesting Brandon because on Monday we had people asking us to see a must drop right and then he goes off against the magic last night and you want to you know  now you want to throw onto the roster I think that that was more of an outlier than a norm sort of performance how much of that do you think was because of the time that Ben Simmons is missing and not the Ben Simmons does a lot of scoring but he does handle the ball quite a bit  Yeah that's the thing I mean and what a concerned me would didn't witty prior to last night was that he had not put up good numbers with Ben Simmons out and you're thinking all right if you can't if you're only giving us like three and a half assists per game without Ben Simmons like what is that gonna look like when he's back and then of course you know it goes for 29 nine and five last night with five threes but that's all kind of how it works with he right like there's for every 29 game there's like three 12 and three games in that feel like the guys scores 12 almost every night and cam Thomas was out last night too so that's something to keep in mind for Brooklyn I don't think he's the most roster player I I roster him if you're in a Content or 12 Team league you know becomes a little dice here in a 12 team ride still I still want him on my roster I want him as an app as an option but yeah I would say he's a must roster for me he's not a must start you know I don't I don't think you're going to if you're in a league with four or five bench spots you really have like five players around your league that are significantly better than did witty and I also don't know if Ben Simmons is coming back anytime soon like this what we're talking about nerve irritation for a guy who's had a ton of back issues I don't think this is like a two game injury  yeah only Ben Simmons gets nerve irritation you don't see that from anybody else  it's a very Ben Simmons injury it really is yeah it really is all right what else can I just mention it until further notice if you bet the NBA can you please just bet Pacers overseas and don't overthink this I mean this team is Captain consistency they've played 11 games so far Nick they're overs are 10 and 1  I mean it's it's the biggest lock every night they play it's just they they've done a really good job of making teams play the style of basketball that they want to play and they don't always win but they are they're one of those teams you talk about teams that we were wrong about the Indiana Pacers are one of them I thought they'd be a lot worse than this this is a real basketball team and and they're controlling Pace every time they take the floor their best win of the year last night I guess oh yeah 76ers and that was that was a game where you just kept waiting for Philly to to take control and it kind of win this one late like you know Tyrese Maxie had a huge you know crossover step back three that tied at late and you're like all right this might be the momentum swing that that finally gives daily this game but entire Talbert man is just so so good you know the lack of turnovers these last couple of games he's just been unbelievable 33 15 and 7 last night he's always good for a couple of steals give you a block last night 7 of 12 from Beyond The Arc yeah I didn't even think Indy played all that well so it's like they shot the lights out from three to get to 132 it was it was a lot of Halliburton you know TJ McConnell gave them some good minutes off the bench and then we saw you know the best game maybe of his career for Bobby topping 27 points 6 boards on 12 of 15 shooting  I think Tyreese Halliburton is right now at least in the conversation for MVP which is oh yeah not anywhere that we would have thought he'd be just based on how where we thought the Pacers were going to be coming into the season but he's on that short list I don't think he's necessarily at yokushi with the way this team's performing right now and you're right that win should start to put them on on a national radar this is a really good team in a lot of fun to watch and for Fantasy purposes they're fantastic yeah there's so much fun to watch I mean they're completely different team with Albert and we saw it last year too right I mean they were like a couple games over 500 with him when he was out when he was not out there they just they have nothing offensively and you know that I think the the lack of creation other other than Halliburton kind of makes them so dependent on him but for Fantasy you know that's probably a good thing as long as he could stay healthy question about the Clippers what's the rest of season outlook on the clips if you had to take a guess Paul George does not look too affected by the hardened trade though Kawaii is kind of struggling is this a Buy Low opportunity on Kauai Leonard and our question asked her here positives could a sar Thompson get it done for Kawhi Leonard does that a deal you could consider  the yes see that's this is exactly what I'm talking about with the Tsar Thompson that I do think that the Kawhi Leonard owner would make that trade and if your confidence that he can put together a Kawhi Leonard type season and not miss too much time then you're going to end up on the winning end of that but there's reason for pessimism right now James Harden has wrecked the chemistry for this basketball team and and I can't trust that Kawhi Leonard is going to be somebody that's going to play more than 60 games in the season so even though it's you probably it's probably the sharper side to get Kawhi Leonard on your roster I'm not sure I'd be willing to make that move right now I'm not really concerned about kauai's recent struggles you know there's been some bad signs you know there's some audio the other night if you have like screaming at zubats mid-game which like it's Kawhi Leonard that's alarming because Kawhi Leonard doesn't talk to anybody let alone shout at his own teammates I don't think he I don't know that he was on board with the hard thing you know I he's always been a passive personality but it doesn't look like he's he loves how the Clippers are playing he's been under 20 points in three of the last four games actually for the last five since James Harden joined the mix so there is reason for concern and Paul George if you watched this team certainly last night like he's looks like the alpha right like he looks like the guy who you know everything's running through him he's far more aggressive he was a guy taking and mostly missing the big shots last night so I understand the conserve with Kawaii the thing with me is like even if I was playing well you just you know you're just waiting for the injury right you're waiting for that need to act up and all the sudden he's in and out and he's missing back to backs and you know we just go through this with Kauai every year but I think the more interesting part of this is you know would you trade us our Thompson form is it worth that risk I don't think I would and I think right now and this isn't just based off of one or two games this is now we're going on a few weeks of the NBA season a start Thompson statistically has been the better defensive player which is crazy to say because of Kawhi Leonard as far as an on-ball Defender is one of the world's best but the statistics just aren't there when you compare it to what a sar Thompson is giving you it just looks so sustainable what I'm watching from Toms and does not feel flukey he looks like he belongs and that's just not a guy that you're gonna have to blow me away in a trade name wise you win with Kawhi Leonard but I don't think it would pay off in the end and I think you could do better  yeah I would try to do better I actually I don't hate trying to get Kawaii just because you said name wise it's like you know Kawaii if he plays even 60 games it's probably worth it you probably out produces a sarsen but yeah I would go for someone who's got a little bit more security not in terms of stats but in terms of games played upside yeah I want somebody who I feel better about getting to 70 or even you know 7275 games free games by low they feel like that's buying high on quite Leonard if you make that kind of move he would be considered a low candidates to see him get him on the cheap freaky we always appreciate jumping in the Stream he asks what's the stream for the Warriors with Steph Curry out and Draymond likely suspended yeah Draymond I think is probably getting a couple of games here these suspensions always come in lighter than you'd expect as far as like putting a player to Chokehold goes like I don't think draymond's getting like we have president for that yeah well it is Draymond so you know if they take into account you know his history maybe we see a few more games but I would guess what two three games for Dream On and five Max five would be the Max and what we said earlier with with staff you know I think they're gonna take him game to game would not be surprised you know if this ends up being more of a week to week thing when you're talking about a knee sprain we'll see I mean clay could get a game or two as well so there's there's going to be opportunity if you're in Daily lineups I mean are you if you have the opportunity to add Brandon pajam ski you know is this something that you would consider for the rest of the week Warriors Saturday against OKC I'm gonna I would do it but you know don't obviously  keep your expectations at a proper level I think in terms of who we would expect to see I mean Moses Moody at some point this is this is your time to shine man like if you're not gonna pop off here then I just don't think it's gonna happen for you so it should be Moses Moody but yeah I mean I would take a shot on ski I mean based on what we saw last night I do think there's going to be like a serious regression like I don't know how closely you were watching that game Brandon I had that one on one of the TVs and so some of these shots were you know kind of Miracle type of plays you know you get a high you know floater and one over Rudy gobert that is just like all right I'd like to see you make that one again like we said the bank in three to end the third quarter like there was there was a little bit of kind of magic behind that game so I don't think you can just expect pajam ski to give you 20 plus every night you know in terms of streamers it's like I guess the most the next most obvious name would be Andrew Wiggins but that's pretty tough one to stomach right now I wouldn't be rushing to grab him you know Dario sorry Chad 21 last night he took 113s got to the line six times he had some rebounds gave me a couple steals so you know if I think he'd be the the kind of obvious replacement for for Draymond Green like if you were if you're looking to specifically replace him in a daily lineup for the next two games maybe just grab Dario star she's probably gonna play 30 minutes and just hope for the best yeah he's seems to be the the go-to starter in this  sort of situation but in terms of how closely I watched the game if it starts at 10:00 at night I'm watching the highlights and reading the box score 10:00 eastern time I have a four year old and he does not care that I want to stay up and watch NBA games a good question here from from one of our Pals what about  Jonathan kaminga ask Kenneth we didn't touch on kaminga I I love the idea of kamanga and you know last night should have been a big opportunity only played 16 minutes which was kind of strange with no clay know stuff no Draymond you know prior to that he had a decent run he scored you know double digits in seven straight games but you know even even in one of considered his better games this year like he's not rebounding at all he has five assists total in his last eight games the defensive numbers haven't really been there he is getting the line a bunch of he's shooting Noble's 80% so there is that but I just I don't have a ton of interest in him like even when he plays well it feels like it's kind of just scoring  yeah he's still such a raw player and you can see just based on the the opportunities that he should be given just based on his draft status talking about a guy that was taken inside of the top 10 just two years ago Steve Curtis and trust him and he still has not refined his game enough Moses Moody is dealing with something similar the only reason why I say trust Moody a little bit more is because he could shoot he could shoot from the outside and that's not part of Johnathan coming his game so I I just don't think kaminga really fits into the flow of the offense all that well it's a little bit square peg round hole for me yep yep I feel the same way there all right we got a message from rival

that's joined rival.com slash roadwire it's time to step up to the challenge on Rival fantasy we will see you in the arena all right Nick we all great at Kravitz here with you take it some listener questions as we move through the Pod Derek Lively rest of season outlook and we have a second question here we'll scoot redeem himself when he comes back so let's let's start with Derek Lively Brandon not somebody who I have rostered on a ton of teams I know there are some preseason hype and you know for the most parties he's look pretty good like I watched him a lot at Duke last year you know this guy who at one point was the number one overall player in his high school class and I just I didn't love what I saw me certainly didn't look the part of it a number one overall recruit you know kind of more of an energy type of player but right now you know you're targeting him for the field goal percentage which is up over 70% and you're looking for the blocks he has at least one block in all but one game this season I radically last night against the Orleans was the first time he did not record a block for the most part though it's been like you know one single block per game which is still valuable you know the rebounds have been a little bit more up and down but where do you stand on Derek Lively is he a guy who is a sustainable starter going to to be playing 20 to 25 minutes most nights I think he is this is exactly the kind of guy the Mavericks have been looking for for years and I think that's why you're seeing him produce right out of the gate this is the type of player that they've been wanting to pair with Lucas somebody who can rim run play some defense and they want they want a big with athleticism because Luke is going to put guys like that in positions to succeed they've been struggling to find that player and and I think Derek Lively my even though he's young he's still the best version that they've had in years was it Javale McGee I think they had like spurts with where they would find guys that could play that sort of role but I think Derek Lively's game is more well-rounded than anything that they've utilized and in Lucas short career  so let's go to part two here we'll scoot Henderson redeem himself when he comes back  I to some degree I think he will I don't think it's going to be as bad as it was before the injury but the last thing he needed was to you know Miss a couple of weeks here and you know be dealing with an ankle we'll see how long that lingers are when he's back in the lineup probably gonna be at least another week if not longer until we see him you know I don't think you know we're gonna look back in March and Scoot Henderson is still averaging like nine points and it forces and four turnovers per game I think it's going to get better the question is is it better to the point where you're actually putting them in a fantasy lineup I don't know man I he's somebody I'd probably be willing to trade like I think even if the numbers have proved he's probably he's gonna be better at points he's gonna be you know I think some of those plays will be more translatable to like real life value as a fantasy like even even like the rookie guards who have like the best rookie guard Seasons they don't tend to rank that high in fantasy  you know his his best days are in front of him which is easy to say because he isn't done anything yet I am still gonna hold on scoot Henderson I don't personally think you can trade him you would get absolutely nothing in return because he's shown nothing if you if you drafted him you know what you were looking for he hasn't shown a glimpse of it yet in NBA regular season action it's gonna come at some point he's gonna put together a couple of games that absolutely wow you you might just have to wait for it so I think it I don't think you can trade him unless he's a throw in and add on to a deal he can't be the the core of it and I'm not I'm just personally not willing to throw them on the waiver wire if you have to do it you know I understand but at this point in the season you should be comfortable just keeping them on your bench good question here from Supremacy he asks who do you think is going to be the che of this season someone who just smashes their ADP could it be Scotty Barnes could it be Tyrese Maxey could it be somebody else obviously Barnes and Maxi are already a good options yeah they're they're in that conversation this season and for reference the the ADP for SGA last year it's kind of all over the place depending on where you look you know ESPN he was going considerably higher but you know for the most part across like CBS Yahoo Underdog he's going around pick like 30 to 35 so you know we're talking about somebody who was baby drafted in the the second third fourth round who could finish as a first round value yeah I think Maxie Maxie the most obvious one right now and I think what he's doing is pretty sustainable now if the Sixers were to trade for klevene or you know bring in somebody of that caliber maybe that changes things that lowers his upside a little bit but outside of those two is there anybody else who who comes to mind I mean jet holder breaks at the top 20 right now in eight cat I think he could be  somebody yeah and we've mentioned to SAR Thompson a bunch of times he's not going to give you the scoring upside that some of those other guys are that we've talked about but I still think just overall fantasy value he's somebody that's that's really impressed early on I'm trying to find somebody else looking down the list of the rankings most of the guys that are performing were relatively expected to do so so I think that you already nailed it there on the question I think those are the guys that have the best opportunity unless there's somebody that's just going to come off the top or open nowhere it looks like it's Tyrese Maxey it's Scotty Barnes and then in a different sort of way a smart Thompson those seem to be the most pleasant surprises and and if we were to redraft today they're adp's would be so much higher than they were going into drafts season yeah it's tough to find somebody else who has like SGA level upside to be do you have to have such a solid staff profile right like and yes our tops and it's like even in a best case like right like the percentages are going to keep them down you know these only scored 12 points per game so it's like he has you know he's ADP was so ridiculously low so it's all it's based on the relative to expectation coming in yeah no question no question I mean he could finish 80 spots ahead of his ADP so for sure I just you know he doesn't have first round upside necessarily the rest of the way let's see who is droppable of this group he's got to make room for Devin Booker joining his roster in a nine cat leaked we should mention by the way Devin Booker Brad Beale Kevin Durant all three expected to do the unthinkable and play tonight against the Minnesota Timberwolves oh you must drop one of these three players Dice and Daniels Alec Burks or Casey p  well I've already dropped Casey p in a league so I guess I would have to stay true to what I'm doing here on my end I think Kentavious Caldwell Pope would be my would be my pick their it's just not really filling up the stat sheet like it was early in the season yeah I mean I see the name Alec Burks and I'm just like yeah I don't know I mean every every fantasy basketball player goes through the Outburst phase where he spends a couple of weeks on your roster and you know it's been good of late I I just I just worry about the variations with this Pistons rotation you know they're like Jane I played 20 minutes last night still found a way for books to play 20 plus like I just like when volcanic comes back when if Joe Harris you know ever joins the rotation like those are both guys who could kind of marginalize him so yeah it's tough I mean and dice and Daniel's like I I like the player a lot I you know I think he kind of got robbed of of his rookie season you know with the injury didn't get to play all that much you targeting the the steals in the assist with him I think what CJ McCollum comes back whenever that may be and even Jose Alvarado is going to have a say in this rotation like I think that we can see Dice and Daniel's take a step back so frankly I don't know that you're gonna like have major regret dropping any of those eyes exactly yeah with kcp I kind of like holding him because he plays a ton of minutes you know have those nights where it gets you like four or five threes it gets you steals just hasn't happened you know this is a guy actually went and picked him up off the waiver wire a couple weeks ago and he's done nothing he had 115 point game so far in about the last month of play he's had five and ten in his last two games hasn't made more than three threes at any point this month we're just and he doesn't give you anything else that's his entire game so if I'm not getting threes from King David's Coldwell Pope I've just not interested  fair enough all right  more than we'll be out of here it's Ben Simmons a drop this is a 14 team category League you know obviously the the question asker sites the the recent development with the nerve issue in the back and I mean I don't I don't draft Ben Simmons anywhere he's been on my do not draft list for a couple of years this is just not something I've had to Grapple with but it's a fair question and you know in a 14 Team league like if you have if you have an IR spot maybe you just throw them in there I just I don't know I don't see this turning out well you know I don't think a month from now but Simmons is you know putting up 12 points nine rebounds and six assists every single night so what do you what do you think my general rule of thumb when dropping a player is is somebody else in my league immediately gonna try and add them because if that's the case then you're better off just trying to get a trade done or you might be making a mistake I don't think Ben Simmons is an immediate add so I would say yeah you can drop them  yeah I'm pretty comfortable with that I don't I don't think you're going to get burned his way out put it like you know worst case scenario he just kind of goes back to giving you like borderline top 100 production so if you come back so he's gonna backfire on you know no I have Cam Johnson in my league should I pick up so I guess the question is should you pick up cam Johnson if he's available yeah I mean unless you're in a super shallow League I would pick up cam Johnson trade question from Jose should I trade LeBron in Balance shooting this for Barnes and caca in a nine cat League I say yes yeah I think I would rather have the Barns and see Occam random  yeah I mean bar just spent the best player of the of the four so far you buying low on siakam you know we talked earlier about LeBron and the injuries the last few years and you always have to worry about that and you know values is fine but ultimately I think there's there's more upside with the two Raptors guys yeah and you're buying low on Seahawk but also siakam with signs of life you know that was my concern about a week ago when we had this conversation was that we just hadn't seen anything and so you were wondering if it if it had all gone away or if they were going to move off of them but Scotty Barnes you know he came back down to earth a little bit but he still filling up the stat sheet and now you're seeing seacom really start to score the ball well so I like what I'm seeing from both those guys  all right another good question here on Zach Levine who was at the Champions classic last night hanging out with Rich Paul just doing the tip the typical like post trade request I'm out there everybody wants to to be public here  if Levine gets traded will his fantasy Outlook be better than it is on the Bulls for example what if you want to the Lakers or the Heat or the Sixers in terms of Team context I would say yeah I mean the Bulls are dead last in Pace they're just a terrible offensive team you know Levine just kind of looks like he's stuck in the mud so I think in terms of like a just pure basketball situation like almost any team would be an upgrade but obviously he goes from kind of the code number one in Chicago to you know if you go to the Lakers is the number three option if you goes to the heat kind of number two ish I guess you know depending on how you value bam yeah Sixers the Sixers to be I mean it would be fun like I get it it would Tyreese Max no I don't want to go to Philly because I think that's gonna throw cold water on Maxey yeah I well I read a report yes I don't know if it was a reporter or a rumor so excuse me there but it was it was from a Philly beat writer that said Philadelphia is unlikely to make this move because they're really happy with the depth that they have so I would be surprised if the Sixers made a trade like this when they already have somebody that plays that sort of a role in their offense and yeah they're hot right now so they don't have any sort  of impetus to make a trade like this I think it's the Heat and and and in terms of in real life it would help them a lot  and in fantasy I think in terms of those three options it would be the best for Zach LaVine because he wouldn't be the number three guy or in the shadows of Joel embiid he would be the number two to Jimmy Butler in that offense and would basically be like a high definition version of what Tyler hero is giving you so I love that for fantasy and reality it reality wise hero would be going hero would be on the way to to Chicago he would be part of that trade guaranteed I think so yeah I mean it's is Levine that big of an upgrade over here oh  yeah yes I think he is  Tyler Heroes done a not a truth three level score Zach LaVine is  I was looking at some of his numbers yesterday catch and shoot 42% from three-point range and he can get to the basket and he's a better Defender than Tyler hero which you can say about almost anybody I think he is and now he's also way more expensive but if you're just looking about looking at it from a basketball lens I think Zach LaVine is a pretty significant upgrade  I think that's fair I think that's fair trade question here from a mean Franz and Lopez for Garland and Looney which side would you rather have  I would much rather have France and Brook Lopez I think I would do the same yeah Lopez has been off to some of a slow start but I mean Looney Looney ranks behind him so far you kind of just targeting the rebounds with loonies so to me it comes down to Who Would you rather have between Garland and Franz and you know Garland has been the better player and fantasy so far but I think the the upgrade of the upgrade of Lopez over Looney to me would slightly push me in favor of if the fronds and Lopez side but this is this video that's a fair deal I mean I like Darius Garland and I think he's probably gonna rank higher than he currently does which is like mid 50s you know he probably pushes into the 30s or 40s at least so fair question it's a points league if that matters  yeah and Cleveland has not been playing all that well I would imagine that tonight we're seeing an upgraded stat line from Darius Garland they're playing the Portland Trail Blazers that tends to be a nice slump-buster situation but Franz you know we talked about it earlier this is steady and fantasy so you kind of you need those guys on your roster you know exactly what you're gonna get and the I think the variety of production you're getting from Brook Lopez far outweighs that of Kevon Looney  great question here from Aunt MMA fight who do you put your money on Draymond or gobert I think go Bears just a little bit too lanky and awkward like I think he could be caught out of position pretty easily Draymond Green as is as feisty as it gets so just based on attitude and I worry about the right hook of gobert taking too long to to meet its Mark I think I'd go with Draymond and you know he'd be a dirty fighter too oh yeah well see I don't watch MMA that's like my that's the bottom of the barrel for me in terms of sports that I care about so I don't know like really what the rules are if the rules are pretty relaxed then absolutely dream on like are you allowed to use weapons are you allowed to choke people out what whatever the case joking people out you can't use a weapon yeah I actually think gobert is probably tougher than he gets credit for yeah I think he's kind of been dragged through the mud and a lot of ways I think he put up a fight he's got the length you know he's got the reach but no I dreamed my might be number one in the league right I mean that is James Johnson still in the NBA if he's not like you don't want it you don't want to be matched up with Drake that's right the grizzly bear man he's got these got the Earth he's got the question I don't know I think I would take Jae Crowder over anybody well Jake crowd was hurt so you know right now he's out of the equation we'll have to wait on his prize fight okay yeah all right another good would you rather hear well you know I assume it's a trade question but we'll just say would you rather roster Jimmy Butler and Mark Williams or Paul George and Alpine shangoo and going forward nine category leak oh like both sides here so this is not easy but I think I like Paul George a little bit more than Jimmy Butler yeah and I definitely I think right now Mark Williams is out playing sing goon but I think I'd rather have Paul George and Alpine  yep me too you still worry a little bit about the sustainability of Paul George just with how bad the clippers have looked with Hardin but it hasn't affected him so far and to me like Shen versus Mark Williams that is a very clear Mark in favor of Shane and the turnovers haven't really been that bad for him like I know that's been an issue he's been a high turnover player per minute in the past he's only had like two per game right now so the night category thing is it's just not that big of a deal for me so yeah I would lean I would leave George and Shane we got all caps question here would you trade reefs for Rozier  no I would not rather have Austin Reeves I know we haven't quite seen it all put together yet but better days are ahead for Austin Reeves towns for Hardin and nurkic our friend Z says he received this offer what do you think  no I'm holding on to Kat in that situation  yeah  yeah I I like James Harden is still a great way too much faith in James Harden still well I mean I don't think James Harden is going to win the Clippers the title here I'm not worried about that but like it feels like he's played like it's been a disaster right he's played five games they've lost all five they look clunky and yet he's still like 45th in fantasy like he's beating his 80P as far as where he was going right at the end of draft season and he's averaging 15 points for rebounds four assists like he's he's still she hasn't missed a free throw he's still a cheat code there the field goal percentage just good he's giving you two threes a game like it's I actually think this is a pretty fair question I I would rather have towns you know the nurse thing to me is like it's almost more like towels are hardened straight up including darkens in there like if you if you're if you're light at Center and like you need a Setter eligible player I actually think this is an okay deal to do because heart doesn't really miss time for the most part he's been very very durable and he's always been a better fantasy player than he is a real life player which says very good real life players so I actually think this is one you have to think about to me it just comes down to how much help do you need at the center spot all right we'll hit two or three more then be out of here  would you trade Cade Cunningham for Kauai in a nine category League  no I'd rather have Cade Cunningham  I think I'd rather have Kate as well I mean the thing is he's turning the ball over a ton so like it's kind of it's kind of a false number here but he ranked outside the top 200 in nine cat because of the five turnovers per game combined with the 40% from the field so I understand it you know Kauai ranks like 170 spots ahead of him right now he's only turning the ball over 1.7 times per game obviously the percentages are better if you if you're somebody who's willing to take the risk on Kauai just you know playing 50 games then yeah this makes sense like per game in a nine category League Kawaii is better I would just rather have the guy that I think could play 75 games versus the guy who played 55  yeah and and I still think there are better days ahead for Cade Cunningham we have it really seen him put it all together this year he's an ascending player Kauai is descending at the moment and just don't think he's filling up the stat sheet like we're used to seeing so now maybe a got my face in the future for doubting Kauai I've been pretty low on him over the last hour of this pod I have Skylar Mays Jeremy Grant and DeAndre ayton and Bilal coulibaly are any of them worth dropping for says Camp tops and I assume it's cam cam Thomas or anything Thomas I think we can Thomas that all that feels like a Thomas autocorrect  yeah look I'm not really that big on cool about Bali fantasy wise I know he's you know we've seen some flashes I I still think he's like just wildly raw like what are the Ross prospects that we've ever seen drafted in the lottery you'll get some rebounds you get some defensive numbers he's got seven steals over the last two games so that's that's ultimately what you're chasing but you know he's gonna be like a 50% guy at the free throw line I think the percentages are going to be all over the place the three-point shooting is actually been pretty decent so far but you know we'll see where that goes in the long term you know cool about it to me is somebody who's if you have the roster spot kind of a fun guy to have I just I don't I'm not really high on him and if it's cam if it's cam Johnson I'd rather have him then that cool of Ali no question if it's Camp Thomas that becomes maybe a little more complicated  I'm just wondering why you have so many Blazers on your team  you know I think we need to share the well here yeah Tyler mazes looked really good by the way  yes and I think as long as Brogden and scooter out that's that's gonna continue you know we're obviously gonna be a few more weeks without Anthony Simons as well all right two more then we're cutting it off  I got a trade proposal Dennis Schroder for Jordan Poole in a 14 team category leak  yeast  uh yeah I think I had I think I'd rather have Dennis Schroder at this point  I am I am all the way out on Jordan Poole  I think that's fair man I mean shooter shooter ranks 85th right now 32 minutes a game you know significantly more efficient the Jordan Poole he was playing more minutes consistently obviously a better producer of assist he's giving you a steal for game I don't think that really changes you know barring barring something unforeseen with Toronto like a big roster shakeup where they bring in a better point guard which I just I don't see that being the case I think they're pretty content with Scotty Barnes and Dentistry or doing the ball handling  yeah he's he's found very clear role that often and Jordan Poole is lost right now and I don't see that situation improving any time soon so give me the proven commodity over somebody who looks to be circling the drain all right this is a good one to end on what do we expect from shade and sharp will he remain in this spot after they are healthy as a team I love Shane sharp one of my favorite players to watch just a freak athlete one of the smoothest athletes in the NBA he's better than a nice run of late he's played 40 plus minutes now in six straight games averaging 42 minutes per game over the last six 20 points five rebounds four assists and a steal you know high volume three point shooter tends to give you two or three per game there it's just like he's not gonna play 40 plus minutes right like we have to be realistic about that first and foremost I still think he's a big part of this rotation but you can't really underestimate you know how much production and how many minutes they're missing right now with Brockton it was playing pretty well Simon's who's going to be a you know 35 to 38 minute guy when he's healthy and then scoot Henderson who you know this is a ultimately a rebuilding year for Portland like they're gonna give him opportunities they wanted to develop him so I still like Shane sharp I still think he'll be roster but no I don't I don't think his current production if we if we isolate these last six games I don't see him being a 25 and 4 guy the rest of the way I think he got to expect some you know some regression there yeah production might take a dip but I think the efficiency could be there they're not going to get away from shade on Sharp he is part of the rebuilding process for the Portland Trail Blazers so even with those guys coming back he'll always have a role this season just based on where they are and in their rebuilds so he's somebody I'm really excited about and then there's no there's no certainty when  especially when you talk about teams that have no interest in winning basketball games there's no certainty that good players returned to the lineup and and Portland is maybe at the top of that list right now all right guys we gotta cut it off here still getting some good questions in the chat we apologize for not hitting the the more recent ones but we will be doing this every Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. eastern so you know if that's a
