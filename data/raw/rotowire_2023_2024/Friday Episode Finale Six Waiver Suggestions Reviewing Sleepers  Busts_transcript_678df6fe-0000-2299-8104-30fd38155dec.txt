welcome everybody to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Rona Warriors free trial at rotowire.com slash try because Friday April 5th 2024 Alex peruva here Shannon McKeown and Ken k train Crites  oh Lord  man that was that was that's the whistle kind of messed up for some reason there that was I guess that's I love capacity is limited yeah well hey everybody who's listening this will be our final sort of normal regular Friday podcast we appreciate everybody who has listened tons of comments throughout the year it's been a lot of fun I recognize a lot of the names you know the regulars who stopped by we've really appreciated that since we've gone to a live format it has been a lot of fun even though all of us have old man Tendencies and we're like we don't want to go on the live stream  get these kids off my lawn  so we're gonna do a little bit of a different format today we're still gonna give you some actionable advice to start off the top  each of us is going to hand out two only two this week waiver wire picks and then for now alright basically it's like for daily weeks right yeah for daily win your finals right now yes um  and then after that we are going to review some of our sleepers and busts from from before the season we had I think three sleepers videos and one bus video so we're gonna grab some names from there and we're going to review see how we did but yeah that'll be be a little more relaxed way to end the Friday podcast although Ken will still have an old man brand so stick around for that  I'm just gonna kick things off with Shannon's Pistons chimezie metu  uh Pistons at four games this week met two despite Jalen Duren and James Wiseman being available continues to play magnets he's playing with the power forward averaging look let's call a respectable nine points five rebounds two assists with 2.5 stocks in 26 million minutes over the past eight games  he's five percent rostered like so if you're in a deeply he's well if you're an Angie League he's available most kind of like a silly seasoned veteran didn't he do this last year was it for Phoenix or what was down the end Sacramento he had he spots for Sacramento that's right Phoenix early this year right right yeah yeah he's always kind of been in the mix it was actually 2021 I'm looking at now he was in the 2021 he played a lot 21 minutes okay anyway Matthew's been there done that before he can rack up numbers in April as as Shanghai has seen with his very own eyes  catless let's just keep it rolling  I'm going to the mess that is Portland we all know about Delano Banton who's probably the silly season MVP this year but I'm bringing up a name we mentioned before power forward 21 year old Jabari Walker of your Portland Trail Blazers he's only 15% roster on Yahoo 2% on ESPN the 21 year old has started the last three games you just had two huge games for the depleted Trailblazers he's averaged 41 minutes and that's what you want to see during silly season is just a ton of minutes a time of opportunity in those two games he's averaged 16 points 15 and a half rebounds and one and a half triples shoots okay from the line this additional chucking is not helping his field goal percentage Portland has a game tonight Friday and a game Sunday so two games this is your finals week Jabari Walker my silly season last second player swap I like it he's been a  favorite of mine on in DFS lineups whenever he gets spots starts another favorite of mine this year we've talked about numerous times my first suggestion taeler Hendrix forward for the Utah Jazz 17% rostered he's been a top 90 player over the past week he's been locked in as the starter starting power forward since late February but his production is really starting to pick up of late he's averaging 13 points 5.8 rebounds three three-pointers per game and 1.8 stocks in 31 minutes per over the past four games marking in is our is basically ruled out for the season John Collins has been ruled out for Friday Clarkson Kessler both nursing what seemed to be minor injuries but like you're seven starting tonight there you go there you go so there should be plenty of minutes and and more looks at more looks than usual for Hendricks for the last handful of games so I like him quite a bit as the free agent pickup  the Jazz well first of all I agree with everything you say but the jazz on March 30th  saying that Laurie marketing will be reevaluated in two weeks you think we're stupid I mean seriously are we bomb the season ends on the 14th oh my God they really really want to make sure they don't give that pick away who gets their pick on the wild chance they've already locked it in but it was like a knife if they didn't hit the worst 10 it was top 10 protected or something yes it goes a lot of somebody was getting their pick like everyone knew they'd be tanking  outgoing okay see okay wait yeah  yeah that's from the old Power Forward Center that you used to be a jazz Derek favors thank you yes yes  you are the man okay  my second suggestion Dyson Daniels of the New Orleans Pelicans come off a long absence but he's back over the past three games he's got two steals against him I think the only played 11 minutes in the first one but the past two games have been great for him total of 25 points not rebounds a system for steals in 46 minutes Pelicans at four games this week running Ingram is still out with the hope that he can be back before the end of the regular season but until that happens Daniels is always going to keep playing more minutes  yeah over 21 minutes each the last two games I I'm gonna I'm gonna go with a repeat  miles McBride granted he is rostered in 55% of Yahoo but only 25% on each on ESPN look we know Tibbs loves to play guys  once they crack the rotation they stay there for about 60 Minutes a game that has happened to McBride he has started the last nine games for the Knicks and average get this over nine games this is high by Thibodaux standards 45 minutes the game I know there's some overtime in there but nine he's averaging 40 five minutes a game for the next 19 points over three assists 1.5 stocks shooting almost 50% from the field and 90% from the stripe if you need buckets if you need percentages he's hidden almost four threes a game make sure miles McBride is check to see if he's available on your waiver wire yeah I I still I go back every time McBride's brought up I go back to a listener or user Watcher question a viewer question Grimes or McBride for the for the Knicks that we had earlier this year you know Pistons Legend Quinton Grimes who made all of its appearances since being traded to Detroit yes shut down for the season my my second waiver wire pickup we're gonna get sassy with it the last of the year so I'm going with the Detroit Piston Marcus Sasser three percent rostered on Yahoo Cade Cunningham's already been ruled out for Friday's game against the Grizzlies sasser's the guy who usually gets those spots starts in five spots starts this year's averaging 10.6 points four point eight dimes one steal and 1.23 pointers and over 31 minutes per game the another option they can look at look at in Detroit with Kate out would be  Malachi Flynn who I'm sure Alex or Nick or someone talked about in a recent episode he just dropped one of the most unlikely 50's ever in NBA history just dominating against the John Day Murray's defense I think when is actually going to be a stream he's been a regular Off the Bench he's top 30 minutes a couple of times I think three out of the past seven games he he's not going to put another 50 piece on anyone but he could be a sneaky stream and daily leaks if if the Pistons are shorthanded  yeah I did want to mention Malachi Flynn but I'm like I do I really think you know we see really a pickup I mean you know I mean yeah it's tough I I do recommend for tonight like I think Sasser is going to be the guy if I was doing a DFS lineup I go with Sasser and Flynn will be more rostered and maybe more of a popular pickup based on the most recent game but sasser's probably going to get the spot started again you know Flip Flip It In Reverse it if if Monty does something crazy and starts Flynn though  okay Sasser not shot about shooting right Shannon I mean he's gonna not at all and he's he's actually been pretty broke lately he's gonna probably have a game whereas threes are actually following falling he's only shooting like 25% in spots from downtown if he has a game where he's actually hit and he can pop off for 25 30 points  I will tell him before we review our sleepers let's get into some fan feedback we do have some fabulous regular fans posting some questions we're going to start with Matt ah show his question here who do you like best for head-to-head ESPN points League streus ubre or rui hachimura I will throw in there  depending on if it's daily moves leagues just check your game schedule and what days you need games so you have as many players playing as many nights as possible so a one player maybe better but if it's on a night when you've only got 10 spots and 12 active players who cares  if you need in the next day you only got five active players get a sixth but anyway back to Matt's question Spruce obray are hatching Mara  I think I would go hachimura  but I can understand walking over a as well as just with him bead back Maxi's also playing yeah um is shot could go down a little bit and how she was like Double-Double upside and as just been playing really well I'm going to go through Bray I like a little bit more for points based leagues when it Uber is bigger dings is the fact that his field goal percentage can be a risk that's obviously out the window and a point space league and Uber is he's pretty much been locked in the starting lineup it's also it's encouraging that he started last night's game against Miami even within bead and Maxi both playing I believe they both played right let me double check yeah they did so both those guys playing and Uber every remained in the starting lineup he played 41 minutes he still got his points he had 18 and 8  I like uber for points it's really buddy hield who's taking the backseat with those coming back all right from Christian good morning fellas I have one move left to make for a pickup in my championships  uh thoughts on Memphis guard Jordan a Goodwin  I like him as a pickup I'm pretty sure it's gonna be hard for me to double check this oh we gotta starting lineup tonight on the lineups page well he's done a two-way contract and that's been that's been the reason for his up and down but the Glee seasons over for a lot of teams but there's a whole game Count thing right they got to keep them under the game Count I know they were doing that I think what's the G League season is over they're just good to go okay like they can just play and the g League season ended for a lot of team so I'll try to double check that quickly but I like Jordan go and assuming he is gonna play and I by all accounts we believe he's available tonight and your point about gonna play gonna not play five dnps in the last nine games I don't know what that's based on certainly hasn't been much injury stuff I thought it was silly yeah g League's stuff to wake contracts stuff when he plays pretty awesome  yeah over the past three games he played three games in a row 27 minutes per 11 points 12 rebounds five assists I like Ezekiel but like like Alex and Ken alluded to you have to double check his availability and make sure he's able to play  all right let's go to Michael  you just was a he just used his last wave of move to and replace amen Thompson with Alex Crusoe the Bulls  thoughts  yeah that's I mean if that's if that's what you need if you need the what Caruso um is giving you compared to Thompson I mean Thompson is he rolled his ankle yesterday so who knows there and he's his offense is kind of taking a small downturn so  I think I think it's a fine move to make that you know it all depends on who's playing what nights and how do you maximize your games like because those guys are pretty equal stats wise I'm not sure matters one or the other I think it's a good spot it's a good swap because I mean one what happened with Thompson's offense production it really aligned with Cam Whittemore coming back as well can't wait more has been in the rotation again for three games Thompson's remained in the starting lineup but whitmore's playing 20 plus minutes off the bench he was six for 14 last night with 17 points and the ankle injury of course you know Four Tops and he played 30 minutes last night but he had to leave the game early with that ankle injury I do worry about his availability for the next game or two well and the rockets are kind of out of it now that they lost to the Warriors right so I'm not sure  let's get some nice words from Matt Carmody loyal fan of the show thanks guys you're advice has been a big help all season help to get all four of my teams into the finals lost one week 21 but have a good chance with the other three all right thank you Matt and then let's see  from Kenny  thanks for all the advice in the past for the Saturday Sunday play would you play stress rui Lowry or Cameron Payne  we are kind of about streusen rui already I know you prefer hachimura how do you like Kyle Lowry Lowry with no e or pain relative to rui  I don't I don't like either of those guys more than really so I I would go I would go through there when you never on the Lakers are going to give David's or James LeBron a big rest night if they're locked in the plane or not and then Ruiz going to get monster minutes right  yeah  yeah I like really give me really there  all right  this from Admiral Julian champagne versus norlands Brian sensible rookie versus the Clippers Wiggins or Wallace versus Indy I think that's the highest over under the night that OKC indie game or Sasser at Memphis I'm getting oh yeah let's go let's go Sasser I think sasser's a big upside right Pistons how many how many healthy bodies the Pistons even have for that game  I mean they're starting Troy Brown for goodness sakes he's been fun  all right let's see we got more thanks but those are from guys we already replied I think that's it for fan feedback  all right  now we go to the fun section of the show where we talk about how amazing we did before the season with our sleepers and busts or how terrible we did um so yeah we have a few videos where we did this I just we just ripped the names off of off of a few of them I did not rewatch all of them just to see all of our in-depth arguments but I'm gonna assume we can just unlock that part of our brain to have an argument and just well we'll just go from there can't remember my neighbor's name but I do remember so that's sleeper logic yeah  well we'll start with the sleepers and then we'll go to bus so we each have I think three so my first one was Desmond Bay and who ended up having a cumulative ADP of 39 okay I do remember I what I saw the video very quickly that I mentioned him in his Underdog ADP was like 52 when I had mentioned him which was kind of ridiculous yo sleeper if you think someone's a sleeper that high in a draft  you know that there's an argument there but it was awesome when he was balling out when he was right in there you know tragic that ankle injury you know I was all in on beIN I'm like I'm not getting these old farts that are gonna get hurt Bane's Young  yeah when Bane plague he ranked 29th and eighth game or eight cat so it was a great run it was like it was a great one who is who is your first sleeper um old man Mike Conley 80 of 131 wound up with an eighth category per game value of 86 and actually he's totals were really good too because the only missed six games despite being 36 years old he played 29 minutes again he had six assists in game he shot an elite 90% from the free throw line and hit 2.13 triples per game my logic here was they had no decent backup point guard there were all in on Conley he was not only going to start but see a ton of minutes you know he added Monte Morris late at the trade deadline but this team just didn't have a true point guard colony was a steady Eddie veteran that not sexy but a great end of draft pick because you always need assistance always need assists  yeah right who's your gosh Shannon do I have to do this all right we all did this with your first name tallent Horton Tucker tht who was the starting point guard for the Utah Jazz at the beginning of the season I know was briefly it's hard to remember back that far but he started the first eight or nine games for you to and over that stretch you know he averaged 10 points 5.6 assists he also shot 38% from the floor 30% from downtown 71% from the free throw line so obviously it was a point space recommendation but he has been an absolute stinker this season keyonte George Collin Sexton much better names to roster from that back court his ADP thats ADP was 150 his eighth cat per game ranking  with 200 and 222 that's sadly watched a lot of those point guard games he had his horses go to play Early in the season he would Barrel in a confused manner towards the basket he would fall down on his bottle in the ball would mysteriously go out about and then he would get mad at the ref for his incompetent right so he I understand why I like the players so much here all right but yeah I mean an ADP of 150 given what we had suffered him in the preseason and the indications that he could start a point guard how are you not going to draft him if he was there you know that's the classic end of draft flyer that may have worked out as we said you always need assists you always need assistance huge they are  my second sleeper  I can't quit him not every he's your sleeper every year pump  is 80 people was 149 despite the fact that he played 18 minutes a game the season before and was 167 and 8 cat  and it's like well if he even sees a little more time here or there when when Karl Anthony towns gets hurt then it's a win and for a lot of the Season you know read didn't necessarily have to be roster in 12 team leads he was more of a streamer  but if you have a 16 Team league or a 14 Team league and managed to hang on  now is your payoff right averaging like 18 and six with we know a nasri can do when he starts so I just felt like he was not being  priced in forced the way he shook have been in deeper leaks  I'm gonna give you a Runway cat the smartest thing I did this past fantasy basketball season be all in on Boston Celtic Derek White had an unbelievable 80P of 100 and I get it they had four stars in their starting lineup and Derek white but he is ending the season in eighth category total stats he's ranked 16th on the road to wire Raider this is his first season of 30 plus minutes a game he's playing 33 minutes a game his first season with over five assists a game he is really Boston's point guard not Drew holiday so many times on offense they put holiday in the corner holidays really become a 3D guy for them you have in the best three-point shooting of his career holiday because they're playing to his strengths he's not going from the top of the key he sit from the corner and they're letting Derek white run the offense he was coming off an 82 game  season last year he's only missed six games this year some of that was the birth of a child  kids but anyway D white also the shaved hair clearly more aerodynamic more dad looking all came together for Dwight love them I I'm most Amazed by the fact my worry with Dwight was just he's gonna be the clear number five option but the way the Boston Celtics managed their rotation manage the availability of all the players to try to I'm assuming keep them healthy for a lengthy playoff run really really helped  and I love the Waits Waits ranking and he is a higher priority than holiday on the offense oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I think the third option I think they realize holiday was kind of miscast as a true point guard in Milwaukee like holiday really is more like an off-guard who was sort of forced to play point guards your point cat I mean we all kind of know this in the back of our heads how old is averaging 12 points a game this year like he just does not really score that much you know what no one in Boston's complaining about it they're just write play great defense when holiday starts Manning up the other teams power for On the Block on defense Boston fans we go nuts we God we love it our point guards ball is a movable object like a younger Kyle Lowry on the Block for their bigs they were putting them on Randall and Randall was healthy for the Knicks we'd have holiday Garden we didn't care if he scored 10 points that game we just love the fact that his banging Randall again all the holiday is the biggest six foot four 205 I've ever seen yes  he's a better version of Marcus Smart  you know what or yeah it's true except for emotionally you're right no one in Boston's complaining about these trades I'll tell you that much but we still love you Marcus  all right let's keep it moving Shannon it's gonna be two hour podcast yeah my my second sleeper was Jalen sucks guard for their Orlando Magic 80P of 155  eight cat per game ranking of 97 the biggest question I mean one is great Suggs Suggs was basically locked into the starting lineup all year which obviously helped his overall value one of his question marks through his first two years in the NBA was his efficiency you know was he going to be fishing up efficient enough to be a fantasy asset and that turned out to be the case this year he shot 46 and a half percent from the floor 40% down 75% from the free throw line that would be nice if that would improve but he's giving you enough threes enough steals to really be an impact fantasy player 2.13 pointers for game 1.4 steals is one of my late round darts that actually worked out this year yeah you know Markle folds missed a lot of the season um Anthony black just not ready really uh yeah for the minutes that helped but I think Suggs it wasn't just that those guys not being ready or being out fueled Suggs to the Suggs improve dramatically as a player  that was that was a great call out you know they tried to have black runaway with that gig and he did not  he he kind of confuses me as a prospect but very good very good perimeter defensive player at a very young age which is hard to do if his offense if he figures it out I still like Anthony blacks long term upside well in frankly it's just defense that is kept him along with his offensive struggles and he's that you're betting on some draft pedigree there too Shannon which made sense of course take us to Washington for your sleeper the panned out my hand any obvious you know I mean the first few months of the season  it I would say he had kind of done what he what he had been doing right it just it was like 10 six and three just very normal numbers but then you're Washington Bullets kicked in and yeah I mean the last I mean you can you know there's a sample that goes from January I mean you know if you want to take it shorter longer whatever but since the New Year obvious averaging 17 points 8 rebounds forces for 33 fantasy points a game which is pretty good and the bet you know the BET was just like the steam isn't very good they drafted him I think it was 9th yeah the drifting of ninth still really young I think they want to give him a shot and yeah that that worked out I also had a misguided thought that they might deal kuzmin at the deadline well that they showed up he probably I mean he could be a piece that you know I don't think anyone I don't know if they were getting many phone calls for obviously but  I don't know you could you could make a case to trade anyone on the Wizards very true uh Ken let's go to your your next sleeper I went to Milwaukee you were backyard gentlemen and went with old man Brooke Lopez who shamefully had an ADP of 92 despite Center scarcity he wind up with nine category total stats value ranking of 26 despite being 36 years old Lopez is only missed three games this season and he's getting the much desired 2.4 blocks a game while also hitting almost two three-pointers a game Elite percentages look I get it Lopez doesn't rebound but honestly it's a lot easier to get rebounds off the waiver wire and then it is to get blocks Lopez Lopez's game is not on athleticism he stands near the rim he blocks shots probably can do that to his 47  you know he doesn't he catches the ball and he shoots the ball from three it's not you know he doesn't need to be in the greatest shape of his life it's okay that he's old I hope he's adp's low again next year Brooke Lopez don't care for his those all state or those Insurance ads he's doing I don't find those very funny um but otherwise an excellent fantasy play  yeah I think I think people hate that he you look at his box scores and you're like really seven points for rebounds from Brook Lopez you know three blocks two you know steel great percentages comes out on ya  Shannon let's let's give you a sort of a Victory Parade here on this one yeah I know another successful sleeper Camp Thomas for the Nets yeah Thomas his ADP was in the 150 range and his eighth cat per game value for the season was 15 he was much better in point space League's he had for average 22 points per game while hitting 2.13 pointers his production only went up the latter half of the Season as Ben Simmons and other players kind of fell out of their rotation or out for the rest of the year for the Nets and campus is been locked in as a starting shooting guard for Brooklyn it's absolutely Bonkers to me that he is the leading scorer on the team he scored he's he outscored Mikhail Bridges who was a darling at draft time you know a routine top 30 pick he Bridges averaged 20.3 points per game this year if there's one thing Camp Thomas does it's score buckets he could be a little bit more efficient from the field but he didn't kill you there I mean 44 and a half percent doesn't kill you so solid overall player and a good fantasy value this season he also started a chip in and other stats that like back third of the year I think he got the message that if he wants to keep  playing he needs to do more than just gun you interesting to see what this net starting five is like next year because they didn't make any progress with this young Court this year  but yeah you're right I think in February if you take his February numbers onward I haven't done this for both players I think he's averaging more points and assists that Michelle Bridges and maybe even more rebounds is dimes win up his other step production some the new coach coaching stuff got in his ear and he  started to do more than just shoot okay you want some super weird news before we go on to buses yes my phone is blowing up here you're probably saw me cheating at it we just experienced an earthquake here in Vermont which oh is never ever happened to my knowledge minor earthquake it was a lot worse near my where my kids work  but I didn't feel anything probably come too fat or just assumed it was gas I could say you're too drunk so you're like  earthquake  just a snowy yesterday what the hell's going on it's spring it's April  we also got news maybe this was the earthquake brownie James has declared for the 2024 NBA draft also entered the transfer portal that's so I assume he it's probably more like he transfers then gets drafted but that's that's happening all right are you guys ready to move on to our busts that we had this season  I'm just going to assume yes because we're doing it um a lot of these at least on my end were based on like injuries and the guys like getting her so yeah and that happens sometimes  I will say my first one Chris Epps scores in guess was it was part injury part what is really going on in Boston in terms of like who is going to run the show what's everybody's touch is gonna look like his ADP was 43 this year is eight cat total is 47 um at least when I looked at it now I'm seeing 56 but I could just be other guys you know Malachi Flynn stepping up  but yeah poor thing is you know still 20 points a game was great on defense you know 1.9 Blocks the game and really efficient you know a lot more Rim running bullying smaller players getting efficient shots and I really wasn't counting on Drew holiday take if you were told me to Holiday was the average 12 points a game I would have said okay those shots are probably going to poor thing yes so I was wrong about that and he also stayed relatively healthy played 54 games so depends on what you think I mean they made that deal for presenting us they said right away we need more of a presence on the Block and everyone here was like is he kind of soft is he really gonna but he did post guys up you like his post up his moral like I'm seven inches taller than you so I'm just gonna do a turn jumper and just shoot over the top but from four or five feet out and hit this you know fantasy wise he's great if you're in a daily leak and you have the time every day to see if he's playing or not and if you're not in the day a little it could be so you're in a week's setting your lineup of porzingis every week can be maddening mm-hmm just knowing how many games is gonna play  all right Ken who is your first bust  my first bust and my top really best bust  I was not keen on Josh giddey coming into this season he had an ADP of 56 and right now eight categories total stats he's at 87  so I'm gonna Pat myself on the back for that one mostly my thinking was one Chad Holmgren  two Jalen Williams continuing to improve his game I expected a nice sophomore breakout season from Williams and three I don't think kitties are ideal fit with SGA I think they need more of a true catch and shoot shooting guard he's more of a pound The Rock needs to drive to the basket does not draw a lot of fouls when he does drive to the basket which is also a problem not great percentages I think with his huge Trevor Trove of picks  giddy's scenarios gonna just continue to get worse also I thought his stats were padded a lot in Prior Seasons when SGA was out and giddy was like the option in the back court all of that meat combined from me picking giddy is a bus pick yeah there were there were some down points for getting in the middle of the Season like December through February he was seeing 24 minutes a game he was the first year out often yeah yeah um I don't know I won't be surprised  if he's kind of the odd man out in their future and they traded him  try and get some guys you fit better and maybe that maybe some of the court stuff will have to do with that we'll see we'll see that I did not predict  Jalen green  for the Rockets ADP of 81  I'm gonna call this one his total ranking looks solid total for the season he's in that 70 range but if you look at his per game production and per game rankings and specifically from the rotisserie side he hasn't been that value valuable he is about 139 on a per game level for eighth category rotisserie averages look okay 20 points 5.1 rebounds 3.5 assist  but some of his flaws are still there he's he hit 42.6% from the from the from the field 33 and a half percent from downtown on the season there have been enough flashes though and he's had a couple of really big stretches and including one that just really wrapped recently from March 14th to March 29th for instance he averaged 33.8 points 7.8 rebounds four assists 1.4 Steals and 38 minutes per game he was hitting threes at a much higher clip during that stretch 5.3 3-pointers made per game and 48% shooting essentially he had a couple like two week hot stretches  but overall his stats took a dip I mean from last year he averaged 22.1 points per game for the rockets and his sophomore season and that dip to currently under 20 points for game so I said that a win I still I do have I am optimistic that green can hit another level after his couple hot streaks that we saw this year but there's still too much inconsistency and any fishing sea for me to maybe draft him above 80P next year it was a good bus call till about February or late February and then March Yeah March streaky I wonder how many people sold low on him even cut him in 10 category or 10 teams and then he just exploded how I don't know how you predict him to just somehow everything Clicks in March of all time so that was crazy you don't I mean in December he averaged 15 points a game on 37 37% shooting for a month um so yeah I think that's I think that's fine to give yourself a win their Shannon my next bus pick Anthony Davis because I was like this man's gonna get hurt  you can't draft them 13th which is where he was going turns out  he didn't get hurt and he's the third best player in fantasy total value  and you know you can put old man LeBron right there too yeah assume both yeah we're gonna miss big chunks of the season they didn't people drafted to them cheap and they're in the finals now  80 played 72 games he's gonna he might he's gonna be maybe reach 75 games this year unbelievable that'd be a crew  it would match a career high 75 games yes which he has not done since 2017-18  so look I mean it he stayed healthy he's been amazing it's not just it's not just like he said healthy right he's been awesome he's ranked 5th and fantasy per game as well the only thing is  I'm gonna say that if I employed this strategy up each of the past eight years it will pay off more than a woman have so next year I will also be calling him a bust they also got any place I think six games they got nothing on a Christian Wood too even when wood was held and then he got for the year but they got yeah um I I also went with a big name bust I remember the time I was just arguing with people that thought he was the number one or two pick but Luka doncic I I is 80 of 3 when I called him a bust and an eighth category totals he's at four uh you know I didn't think you were I watched your argument on this because I'm like can't I thought Luke was gonna be a bust you were talking about nine cat was like yeah I will his credit he did improve his free throw percentage from a bad 74% to a more tolerable tolerable 78% I did not expect that because it's three prior years were 74% are worse so he shot a your high 78% from the line and he still manages to shoot 49% from the field on very high volume that's fantastic but you're right it was all a nine category argument and his turnovers did go up from 3.6 a game last year to 4. 2 4 9  come on baby my next best was Paolo bangkero for the Orlando Magic similar to Jalen green and Carol was fine in points basically it's very solid saw a nice growth in a sophomore season butt in rotisserie leaks not that great I mean really was about depending on the ranking system for totals in the 100 range if you go to per game he's in that 70 range I've seen him as low as 150 for a rotisserie rankings for nine categories Bank Cairo was a top 50 pick I mean and and oftentimes he would go above his ADP because people were expecting that sophomore breakout but 22 and a half points 6.8 rebounds 5.3 assist he jumped up from 3. 7 5  reminds me of this year but the the inefficiency is really what dragon down 71.3% from the free throw line it's tough to get over that if you really is going to be an elite fantasy option he needs to get that up to like 80 and actually do something on defense as well decent decent on defense but 1.5 stocks he needs more than that so salad growth is a player I still love his upside long-term but he has some holes as a fantasy player that are points League guy than rotisserie guy for sure yeah he's shooting his shooting is still really up and down like you look at the percentages across the whole year like field goal percentage three-point percentage you know he mentioned free throw percentages down but if you go like the month by month splits  it's just really like in December 28% from three two months later 30% from three you know free throw percentage she shot 78% from the free throw line in March 69% in January like he's still is really inconsistent his shots kind of weird it's a lot of wrist like you're watching on me like he pulls up and he just flicks it was almost like a two-hand flick show with his wrist kind of bizarre I don't know always upside as there but yeah I think he's definitely better points lie player than category League player which is important to know when you were Drafting and looking at 80 peas Alex take us to the Flat Earth  Kyrie Irving you know I was thinking I'm on Monday I'm going to see the the eclipse and I was wondering is Kyrie Irving  is he going to be there or is he going to like denounce it I really don't know like what is his take on the on the solar eclipse I would love to know  but yeah Kyrie my argument was look there's the off the court stuff  maybe that results in absences maybe it doesn't but he had not been a healthy player is entire career before that he's injury-prone player who had played 70 games twice in his career three times sorry and it's career basically like Anthony Davis Level Health  I was like you do not draft this guy 26 because he will not play 65 games for you  he's played 54 games right now he is 36 the Nate cat total so if you drafted him at 25  it's not the reason you lost your league let's put that way he's been fine he's had a really good year like super low turnovers his usual 25 points five assists go to efficient I mean great efficiency I should say not good he's he's 5490 right now but I it's just something where I don't think he's almost ever gonna get you your value on 25 for ADP just because of his of the injury absence of the fact he's 32 now yeah name that he's a lot of name value a lot of name value yeah here's a one one interesting stat for Kyrie a career low 1.8 turnovers per game while still averaging over five assists I think that's that's nice to see playing along well that's all Luca right that's just look at being a real point guard and he's not handling the ball nearly as much all right I had a bus pick that did not pan out much like really same logic is Anthony Davis I was shying off of Kevin Durant which wound up being the demise of her and fbk C team Shannon and I know Durant had an 80 of 13 and he accepted that fact a category total he ranks sixth because he played 69 games which is a four year high for Kevin Durant he was coming on the 35-year old  was coming off a 35 and 55 and 47 Game season I did not expect anything north of 65 games for Durant and I was wrong another example how this was the Weir year that all the got to get hurt guys did not get hurt I wonder how that's going to affect adps next year if people are going to if people are gonna be like well the 65 game rule work these guys are never going to get hurt now like that's not really I don't think that's really what happened I don't think direct cares about his trophy case I think he was just unusually healthy this year and wanted to keep playing plus the desperately needed them with bills health and wasn't Booker out Booker missing time too yeah yeah  all right it's time you gotta put a bow on this thing  all right the worst bus call of all Victor went by Yama Wendy  was an ADP of 20 during draft season at the time I I don't think I'd ever recall seeing a rookie being drafted in the top 20 you know maybe LeBron James maybe but it's very very rare that you see a rookie being drafted and one of the first two rounds that was the case with Wendy and Not only was he well worth that that late second round pick he would have been worth a top five pick because on total production Wendy was the 5th overall player and a category League's and per game production he was the sixth overall player and the per game production doesn't doesn't surprise me too much so he's top 10 it surprises preseason me absolutely but the fact that he was able to play enough games he's played 67 games so far and have a top five total production and his rookie season is just Bonkers I did not believe that he was going to be you know looking at his ads from overseas the block totals were not that impressive the they were they were well they were well below what most sites were projecting for him and in the black Bloc category I thought that the percentages could be an issue but Wendy's been fantastic and you know it's very very easily could be the number one pick in fantasy next year I agree as far as next year very easily would be the number one pick I was with you though Shannon I looked at that slight frame and thought some teams are going to bully him I thought the Spurs are going to be terrible even with wemby so they're going to rest them a lot Popovich always happy to give guys a rest when the games don't matter and yet we saw these great quotes most of the season from Wendy about I want to keep playing I care about our win total now I'm not I'm not tanking through it interpreter maybe the interpreters smart I don't know just at the right things but you know maybe it wasn't through The Interpreter actually  I don't know but anyway the game Count was awesome and I thought it would be terrible too yeah  well I think it's through through the first October through February he played 28 minutes of game and if you had told most people actually most people thought he was only a play 20 minutes ago or 28 minutes a game you know and they're like well how cookie really be yeah I mean everybody who drafted him in that 15 15 to 25 range well you know while we're at it how about Chad Holmgren not missing a game all year my goodness if there were two bodies that look like they would get hurt those guys look like they're made out of balsa wood and yet  great game Counts from both of them kudos to Homegrown for not missing a game that's a amazing mmm  well Ken  it is time for your last old man rant of the season  ah Gary Trent who's played in just 66 games this season for the Raptors  he's young and yet he sat out Tuesday for rest purposes what did you know that John Stockton Hall of Fame point guard for the Utah Jazz had 16 16 16 Seasons where he played the max 82 games plus a lot of playoff runs that includes his last four seasons when he was aged 37 to age 40 in fact when he was 40 years old and his last season he played in all 82 games and averaged 28 minutes per game Michael Jordan the goat played in all 82 games his last season as a 39 year old with the Washington Wizards he played 37 minutes a game that year  but 25 year old Gary trench needs a rest damn you silly sees and play ball  hey you put Gary Trent the same conversation as John Stockton so  finally he gets arrested  yeah no I think I'm actually heard my dad do that exact rant probably every year that I've been alive um so yes that is uh thank you thank you for thank you for capping capping off the podcast with that okay everybody that's it thank you
