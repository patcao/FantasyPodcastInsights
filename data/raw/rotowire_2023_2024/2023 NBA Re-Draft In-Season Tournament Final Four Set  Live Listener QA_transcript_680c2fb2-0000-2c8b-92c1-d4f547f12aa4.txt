welcome to a Wednesday morning edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast the whale and Brandon Kravitz here with you as we are every Wednesday Brandon we had the RotoWire holiday party last night out in Madison Wisconsin Good Times there unfortunately you did not make the flight up on a on a Tuesday evening from from the Orlando area but good time there good to see a lot of the guys I was at a it was at like one of those golf simulator type of bars I was called social I don't know if that's a chain or not ever time there as you know love golf love golf simulator did not take a single swing the whole time but it was kind of cool because they had other stuff you could do like a home run derby they have some sort of soccer hockey football like it was not just limited to golf so fun time there apologies that we're starting like two minutes late  I would blame the holiday party that's actually not what happened I was caught up watching a Santana Moss highlight tape on Twitter and then realized that it was already 9:31 you you entirely kill I guess all caught up as everything's And Then There Goes microphone everything's coming up Santana Moss this is one of those weird phenomenons I haven't thought of saying Tana moss and months I love not sure where where I'm at with my Santana Moss inventory but yesterday I saw the list of Tyree kills top receivers all time in Santana Moss made the cut not surprising they're kind of cut from the same cloth but right now here he is popping up yet again in a conversation today yeah if you had Santana Moss being mentioned in the first two minutes of a fantasy basketball podcast today good for you you've already hit your first bet of the day I was a huge Santana Moscow you know it like he was like you never knew which if he was gonna be on the then Redskins or the Jets any year it felt like he was just bouncing between those two teams at all time ironically same with Liberty is Kohl's another all-timer from the 2000s but oh yeah both of those guys were just stalwarts on Madden you know they weren't 98 overalls they were like 87 overalls but they were they were fantastic nevertheless we will talks about basketball here we had two games in the NCAA tournament quarterfinals last night we'll talk about both of those we got a huge 11 game Wednesday night slate now coming at us and of course the semifinals on Thursday I also want to talk a little bit about the 2023 draft Brandon and you know we're not gonna do a full redraft We're not gonna go 60 pics Steve you know like hey where does a you know where does Mojave King the 47th overall pick where  does he go in a redraft but I at least want to talk about the the top five to ten and say you know we got 20 games under our belt now you know what teams do anything differently if we redrafted that but let's start with start with the games last night we will of course get to live listener questions later in the show as well I thought New York you know I thought the Knicks would hang around a little bit better than they did with Milwaukee and this was this was a closer game than the final score would indicate but once things unraveled for the Knicks I mean this this turned into a laughing I mean 146 points allowed by far the highest total of the Year by the Knicks  the snakes team is befuddling because their top 10 defensive team in the NBA but yet they've had numerous games this year where they've they've just been a complete sieved defensively and and last night was a good example of that it's hard to stop Milwaukee when they're shooting 60% from three point range and it just seemed like one of those games where in the next didn't play their game that's definitely the case that they were never even close to slowing down Milwaukee Janice was patient he wasn't forcing it a very smooth 35 points for him last night it just seems like this Milwaukee team starting to settle into themselves I was on the next plus five and a half last night so that one definitely hurt and watching that one unfold because you did get the impression late in the game that Milwaukee just wasn't going away and it was good to see him I mean long term I have a lot of faith that this Milwaukee team can go deep in the in the playoffs I had them in the finals once they added Damian Lillard and last tonight was one of the first real indications I saw that they might be able to follow suit with those bold predictions  yeah we're down to Milwaukee Indiana now in the Eastern Conference one of those teams will be representing the east in the in season finals and I think if you're Milwaukee you're okay playing Boston in a rematch but you're happy to face Indiana as well and that game I mean if the books are putting up 146 so they're still not playing great defense I mean this is a game that that could easily be played in the 140s or even higher with the pace that that Indiana brings the table right about that one's already up to 250 by the way 2550 I believe oh yeah so that would be I think tied for the highest total of the year I don't know we had that that Hawks Pacers game a few weeks ago I'm not sure where that close but I know what opened around 2:52  yeah that makes sense man I'm actually seeing it at 2:54 and a half at DraftKings so keep playing so yeah so it opened that 2:52 and it's on the rise and for good reason I would hop on that way it's not gonna get any higher that's got to be the peak of the market I think it probably drops it opened like 247 and already got steamed to 2:52 and I checked and now you're looking at 2:54 yeah I mean those teams are going to score like crazy but at some point we've at some at some point the points bubble will burst yes it's a it's a losing Market I think in the long term but when the Pacers are involved you never know the three-point shooting from Milwaukee I was talking about it you know with some guys watching last night and it's it's so simple and it applies to basically every team in the league but look if you're getting 63s out of Malik Beasley and you're getting five more out of campaign and AJ Green and Marion boat champ is getting into the mix like that solves a lot of things for Milwaukee you know that doesn't just you know snap your fingers and all the sudden you're the best team in the Eastern Conference but you know for an offense that is looked a little bit clunky it hasn't been the main issue for Milwaukee by any means but you know there's been a kind of a lot of my church and why are we not seeing more pick and rolls between Damon and Indiana's you know when he got your role players knocked down open threes it's gonna make your offense you know look so much better On Any Given night  yeah and it was just coming so much easier for Milwaukee it felt like every time New York was in transition it just was it was a it was a slog for them and sort of one of those where everything just looked like it was more difficult for the Knicks and what about Julius Randle the easy goes off for 41 we've seen this guy score under 10 points multiple times in the last couple of weeks I cannot get a hold on what Julius Randle is this season I'm sure I would think that we'll get questions about him today on the on the live chat but yeah you're right it does come down to those role players role players at home knocking down threes once that starts to happen for any team in the NBA they're really tough to be  yeah I'm ready brought up Randall very weird player very weird career you know I I love that his nickname my basketball reference is Beyblade that makes a lot of sense to you he pays exactly like a Beyblade would just got a you know always spinning his way into the lane with the elbows out two-time all NBA two-time All-Star he's got the most improved player award as well yeah I think he's gonna be a really interesting case as far as like how do we remember Julius Randle we can talk about a fantasy wise of course as well but there's like the variants in terms of just efficiency year to year you know it'll shoot 52% one year and then 45 the next and then 41 then back up to 46 you know this year three point shooting has been in disaster again like I said he's not on like a Hall of Fame trajectory and yet you know this this will likely be the fifth time in the last six years that he's averaged 20 plus and almost averaging a double-double in that span like to be is he is he kind of like the new DeMarcus Cousins like I feel like Pete cousins was maybe a little better  yeah because I think cousins would sort of give you that well-rounded fantasy performance more so than what you're getting from Julius Randle and I misspoke it was that so I was thinking back to that six point outing back in early November against the Cleveland Cavaliers that one still sticks out like a sore thumb for me but I mean nothing close to 41 as of late and and you just can't rely on that is the general point but he's not giving you anything in the blocks or steals Department night and night in and Night Out rebounding is there assists are all right he's just one of those guys that it he's hard to rely on to be any sort of consistent producer for your fantasy team but he's also hard to get rid of because what he can do last night I mean he's fantastic at points league right I mean if you're not really worried about the efficiency and if you were to play in a league that doesn't value turnovers  not there's a lot to like about Julius Randle but I think he's always going to be on that line of  you know how effective is he in real life versus some of the raw numbers that he puts up you know 41 6 and 5 but you lose the game by 24 points certainly he was not the reason he was efficient last night 14 of 19 from the field 11 of 12 at the line I thought Milwaukee did a pretty good job limiting Jalen Brunson I mean part of it was Bronson just wasn't heading to threes you know you just had of 22 five of those misses we're 3-pointers oh five from Beyond The Arc didn't have a great night at the line as well it was really it really kind of felt like Randall and RJ Barrett were the only guys who were consistently able to beat this walking team I mean Michelle Robinson was completely shut down quit and Grimes took one shot in 18 minutes and you got that the heart quickly even genso Trio Off the Bench those guys are fine but they were outplayed frankly by the Milwaukee bitch yeah and one of the reasons I like New York going into this matchup not only were they more more cohesive unit coming in to a game like this and for whatever reason I felt like that mattered going into an in-season Tournament game even though in some ways it's still just a regular season game so I've got to figure out a way to parse that properly of as far as how they value these games in the tournament but I liked their size going up against Milwaukee's size and I think some of that played itself out but what didn't play itself out was that the guard play for New York was downright atrocious and you saw every guard on Milwaukee's team fill up the stat sheets so that seemed to be the difference there was just one of those games where Milwaukee was going to be whoever they played last night they were they were two locked in offensively and once they got that crowd behind him they were impossible to stop  you know that's just Adrian Griffin a veteran head coach who no one has questioned this entire season that's what he does he sure is that how it's going up there and Pacers in the Eastern Conference side of the bracket yeah  that's about nothing but positivity when it comes to Adrian Griffin I can tell you that  the Milwaukee four and a half Point favorites over the Pacers in the semifinal tomorrow like you said I told up to 254 and a half the Pelicans in the Lakers are the other side of the bracket Brandon Pelicans two-point dogs against the Lakers keep in mind that these games are neutral site so there's not it's just not going to be a true home court advantage for either Milwaukee or La despite them being technically the higher seed what kind of environment are you expecting in Vegas yeah Alex and I talked about this on Monday we couldn't we couldn't quite settle on like you know what is this gonna look like I think it's an advantage for  for the Lakers because I think you have a bunch of Lakers fans a lot of La transplants in Vegas you got some people that are willing to make the trip from La I don't know if you could say the same thing about New Orleans I think this will have a it'll be a mix of like a final four and like summer league where I I'm not expecting this to be like an overwhelmingly intense crowd  yeah I would say some early guns steroids might be the best way to put it you all have a lot of people in the stands that they'll just be cheering on whichever team they placed a bet on that night so you could factor that in  the Lakers I wondering if this plays a role at all in terms of neutral site an unknown sort of environment the fact that the biggest stars on that team played and excelled in the bubble in 2020 not that there's I mean these are real fans that are going to be in attendance but it is sort of an odd NBA environment and they know what that feels like and and how to mitigate those distractions if there are any and New Orleans might not have that same advantage or they definitely don't I just I don't know how much that's gonna come into play I like the way that this Pelicans team is playing right now though and the Lakers got bailed out last night so my first inclination is to take New Orleans I like how they're so fully stocked we're seeing guys that we talked about on this podcast weekend and week out not even getting minutes I spent precious Fab dollars on Dyson Daniels he's there to be found so yeah well I you know the Daniel saying we could talk about that you know what we started doing Q&A later in the show you know they have too many guys and that's a it's actually a good thing right like I think we talked about New Orleans last season as man this might be the deepest team in the NBA they might not have the top end Talent you know took a pair to a team like the Lakers or the Suns for example healthy but I mean there are very few teams that go as deep as they do you know like you said Dyson Daniels is getting 12 to 15 minutes at least for most teams in the NBA even so like Jose Alvarado is kind of a marginal player for them now I think he'd be viewed at a pretty good backup point guard for a lot of teams New Orleans obviously got the win the other night against Sacramento I think we have a really fun final four here it's a good mix of like two powerhouses in the Lakers in the Bucks and you know two teams that almost feel a little mid-major you know if you want to compare this to the NCAA tournament and you know it's hard to say the team with you know science Williamson and Brandon Ingram but she's a column are these Plucky underdogs they're not George Mason by any means but it's a the Pelicans at the Pacers specifically like these are the type of teams  when we talked about the NCS and tournament months ago when you're like all right let's try to pinpoint like what team would take this seriously they have young guys haven't really wanted anything and I think those two teams fit that bill perfectly absolutely and that's why I'm still got I've got a Futures ticket that I'm sitting on for the Indiana Pacers to win this thing and I'm just so close I got it at I think it was 25 to 1 on when when I this was they had I think it was after two of their group play games so it wasn't at the very beginning of the tournament it was once I realized  they just seemed like they were a different sort of locked in for this thing and Tyreese Halliburton is playing some incredible basketball I don't need to tell you that yeah I just felt like they it was gonna be one of those types of teams the teams that were good enough to win but all so young enough to not realize that it doesn't actually matter and the Pacers fit that bill as well as anybody so the Pacers in my Orlando Magic but those more of a homer play and they should have advanced but unfortunately Point deferential got the best of them but yeah so I'm actually surprised that you see teams like Milwaukee and the LA Lakers and and those teams advancing the way that they have and these these guys have cared a lot more than we thought they would I thought Kevin Durant looked heartbroken that he wasn't able to move on to go to Vegas Jayson Tatum same thing I did not think that we would see that from the league stops story Jayla Brown maybe not so much he seemed to recover from that loss pretty quickly and that's about what you'd expect but we've heard we've heard player after player over the last couple of weeks you know it's one thing to go as far as Halbert didn't be like I'm a loser man I've never won anything I would I want to win this thing right but we've seen you know Damian Lillard Zion like guys are talking about yeah 500,000 dollars like I realized yeah I make 50 million dollars it's not that big of a deal  it's a big deal to a lot of people on the team you know you were nine ten eleven twelve guys who aren't making that much money I mean that's basically what half of their their salary for the season if you're on a minimum you know guys you I think it was Zion said it's like yeah it's something that you could just kind of give to your family which great if you have the ability to do that that's fantastic I mean you're doing pretty well she can hand your family 500k but I was skeptical that the money would matter if it feels like it does you know I guess maybe we're just thinking of these guys just being so well he that 500,000 dollars is a drop in the bucket but the way they've talked they've talked about it I think I think the money is enough of a motivator I still would like to see something a little bit more I wouldn't say tangible I guess I would be more intangible like something that relates to the season a bit more to be on the line because I just wonder you know long term viability is the money thing going to be sustainable I think what sustainable is that these players have cared and and so whoever wins is going to feel an enormous sense of Pride that they get to carry with them through the remainder of the season it's clearly hurt those that have been knocked out of this tournament I can tell you on a local level I mean the magic players were heartbroken that they were unable to move on and like I said we've seen even some of the stars that should know better than to care about this and they've still been bothered by it I think that that is the the tangible or intangible that moves forward into next year that it I think when it started would you agree that it felt like some of the guys the biggest stars in the league were gonna act like they were little too cool for this and that was gonna be the problem and that hasn't been the case so by Next Year everyone will be you know it won't be nerdy to care about the NCAA tournament even though I don't know I think that might have just been a made up media narrative that never  really was going to exist in the first place I think so and I think my fear at first was at the players were just gonna be you know taking the company line and being like yes I love the in-season tournament but I actually think it's genuine you know here in these guys talk about it like I don't I don't I think the league has encouraged especially players like LeBron you know to to try to sell the other players on it because if LeBron cares then other guys are going to Care exactly I don't think it's just him doing PR for the league I think he I think he genuinely cares and I think a lot of these guys do and you know the other thing is we like I'm trying to think of an example of something that's been implemented like this like in my conscience sports fan lifetime like it is it is weird to be in year one of this everything else as just been going on forever you know like the NCAA has been happening forever like I guess the college football playoff maybe would be the best comparison yeah it's only been around since 2014 so we had to wrap our heads around that yeah and you know it's not the perfect system by any means I think this is a much better system in terms of fairness and you know there's reasons for that smaller League all that but you know it's one of those things that I think seems looking at first if you don't like it you know you you're probably thinking oh man this but this is gonna ruin the league and then you probably you know two or three years from now it's just gonna be part of your life and that's that and you continue to build history right like the first one there's nothing to compare it to so you know I think it's I think it's special in some ways you know especially for someone like LeBron who cares about the list of accolades it's like you know won the first ever in season tournament you know won the championship in the bubble those are unique achievements but I think this is something that as it continues to build and time goes on it's gonna get bigger and bigger and players are gonna care you know it's like if the Lakers win it can they repeat next year it's just kind of another yeah another thing to add to a resume and look they're gonna play these games anyway I think that that's a big factor in all of this too yes it's not like these are additional there's only one additional game and that's only if you make it to the championship of this thing and by that point obviously you're completely invested and winning that one extra game but I think we all sort of started to view it in a similar way to the way we react to the NFL's mobile or it's like come on do I really want to be a part of this yeah well if the Pro Bowl was something that you were already doing in the middle of the season anyway then yeah you'd care more about it but because it's this ancillary I've got to then put in extra effort to go and do this at the end of the season when the grind is over it's easier to just kind of scoff at it and say yeah you go do that I'm not interested these guys were already gonna play they were already gonna be motivated for these games this just gives them a little added a little extra seasoning in the in the meal I like it I like it let's talk a little 2023 NBA draft after that we will get to the live listener questions so keep keep throwing those in the chat there we will get to them we'll just kind of go across a logically through that list in about five or 10 minutes but we are at the Cort report in the season of Brandon I like to do this at least two or three times per year just to check up on the NBA draft we're not write anybody off we're not saying anybody's going to be a future Hall of Famer except maybe weapon Yama who by the way is no longer the favorite for rookie of the year I noticed yesterday well perusing the DraftKings Sportsbook chat homegrown has overtaken him but we're not talking good because he is not a part of the 2023 NBA draft so I wanted to just go pick by pick and we can kind of debate all right if this team had to redo that pick who would they take is there anything we have to say about number one I think it's goes without saying that webinar was still goes there he yes no doubt we've still seen enough of his freakish talents on display as it hasn't put it all together other yet but we've seen enough to where you there's still no chance in hell you'd ever pass on that so yeah that's that's a no-brainer even if Holmgren was a part of this class no tea would take homegrown over him and you could argue that homegrown spend like better on balance so far there's not a single team that would take homegrown over women llaman in a draft type of setting I don't think so I still think he he just projects to be the type of player that we've really never seen before and I don't say that lightly because we've seen some incredible talents roll through the league but he is  he is something in and of himself the way that he can the way Maneuvers the court plays defense handles the basketball at his size and let's be honest the marketing appeal of it too that's not the reason you take a guy but all of the media attention that they've had I just watched a special last night on NBA TV just detailing his his ride from the draft through media day and I mean the amount of coverage this guy was getting before he ever played a real NBA game you can't put a price on that it's just not the kind of thing you ever pass up yeah kind of reminds me right now of LeBron versus mellow and they're rookie Seasons where like you could argue mellow had the better year like mellow for the first half of the Season at least look like the better player and at the end like you could have I think you could have pulled every executive in the league  and said all right well hey would you take me over LeBron not a single one would have done it right and I actually think Rookie of the Year might play out similarly because I think mellow deserved it more than LeBron did back then even though LeBron was a better player I think Melo had the better rookie year they gave him they gave the Rookie of the Year to LeBron and I think they're gonna do it to weapon Yamaha as well I think I think Chet has to like dramatically outplay him because of like the incumbent status for women yellow well and right now he is so if he keeps this up I think it is Chet holmgren's award even though philosophically I just I disagree with him being able to win it you've spent a year in an NBA system to me that's not really but I understand that that's the rule  are you saying we should strip Blake Griffin of his rookie of the year I am saying that that's not a rookie you spent a year in an NBA system nutrition workout oh playing with a teammates and practice coaches refining your game that's not a rookie all right fine this is all just like you know disinformation campaign so you can get Jett Howard or or Anthony Blackie award  yeah but how it has to play a minute of NBA basketball first  uh yeah I don't think we would I don't think we'll be talking to talk about Jen Howard but it gets interesting now if you're if you're going to pick number two so we're assuming San Antonio will still take weapon Yama we'll take a bit of a leap of faith there yeah Charlotte do they still take Brandon Miller I think they do we haven't seen a ton but I think we've seen enough he looks really comfortable out there on an NBA floor he's such a natural score another guy that you just can't teach that sort of length and Mobility  and and it's I think it's what they need they need somebody else so where they're not just relying solely on lamelo ball not just when lamelo's on the floor belt so because he's rarely on the floor these days and and the guys that are right after him do I feel good enough about them where I would be willing to to miss on Brandon Miller I think I'm still there where do you fall on that I I expected there to be a bit more debate but I think it's pretty clearly Brandon Miller to me right now you know two or three we go I think there was a pretty strong case for a sar Thompson yeah and you know it's not that he's become a worst player in that time but you know the minutes are down like Detroit's just kind of using him weirdly and there's still some pretty significant concerns I think with the Tsar in terms of you know what the offense is going to look like the shot needs to be pretty much completely rebuilt you know the confidence in that shot is a question mark So I think a star tops in long term you know defensively and what he could be like there's a debate there I think there are maybe are some teams that would take him over Brandon Miller but it's kind of you know Brandon Miller where he's at offensively versus where us our tops and his defensively he might say it's comparable but I want Brandon Miller you know they're both young I think Miller profiles is somebody who should be at least a decent Defender but he shouldn't 46% from the field 38% from three 80% of the line 14 for and two for a guy who plays on a bad team that you know has some guys who probably don't integrate the way that they should I think it's been relative to what I expected you know almost the best case start for Brandon Miller because I was I was iffy on how this was gonna work on that Charlotte roster  yeah and part of that is that they've needed him to step up quickly miles Bridges missed time at the start of the Season lamelos Miss time now as of the last couple of weeks so he's been thrust into a role that maybe he shouldn't have been this early on but like I said he looks comfortable in it so I feel pretty solidified in the in the in the top two and it's after that where things are going to get dicey for me okay  all right well I'll leave it up to you you're the Portland Trail Blazers GM Brandon who are you taking that number three  oh man I still think I'm gonna go with scoot Henderson I  this is tough  I am not willing to write him off yet it's a little bit chalky to just go with the draft pick that actually occurred right in front of your face but we're only a quarter of the way through the season and I loved his Prospect coming into the NBA his explosiveness he just looks a little bit disjointed out of place I don't think that he's found his role on this team but I'm sure that Chauncey Billups will get them there eventually  I'm just gonna go talk about a leap of faith I haven't seen it yet but I still think scoot Henderson should be number three I'm not blown away by a lot of the guys that are drafted there in the top 10 thus far so it's a little easy to just say yeah based on even though I haven't seen it yet I'm still willing to go that route yeah I think that's fair and it's a good point about the class overall that like usually by now you know there might there's somebody that emerges you know whether it's outside of the top five or even later in the first round where you're like oh man this is an immediate mistake you know you think of like Donovan Mitchell back in the day if you like three games in like this guy should not have gone outside the top 10 thank you clearly a top three player in this class and you know I think you know Fraud's Wagner a couple years ago it was pretty clear early on with him shanku went 16 yeah when he started playing real minutes I think we realized pretty quickly what some teams had missed out on but I don't know who that guy is in this class you know is it I guess maybe Derek Lively at 12 I was looking at Lively I would definitely I'm definitely gonna end up pushing him up quite a bit but I'm not to the point where I'm saying well forget scoot Henderson and everything that I thought before the season I'm just not willing to go there right now we're 20 games into the NBA season it would be so Hasty to just say yeah forget everything you thought you knew scooter  Henderson stinks I'm not I'm not willing to go there yet you pointed it out on this podcast numerous times it's hard for guards to pop off early on in their NBA careers it's a lot to ask these guys any dealt with health issues early on as well so I'd be much more willing to make a bold Claim about how wrong the Trailblazers were three by the time we get to the 75% Mark of the season  yeah I agree with you there's a long track record of players who've turned into very good guards in the NBA you know struggling early on especially with efficiency I'm just surprised the degree to which scoot looks kind of overmatched for somebody who's pretty billed for his his size pretty athletic you know he's not he's not 511 he just he just doesn't really look like he has an athletic advantage out there right now and I thought that would be something that'd be a big positive for his profile with all that said I think there's still a pretty strong case to keep him at number three I certainly wouldn't move him up but  I don't know if anybody has like snaps that spot away from him right and that's a lot because it's good played pretty badly he's been pretty big disappointment so far and there's still nobody where you're like yeah I think I would for sure have that guy you know this is so team specific Nic because let's not forget what the Portland Trail Blazers did they moved off of their star guard they kind of had to bring in a new point guard to usher in that new era and make it seem as as clean and seamless as possible so I'll go back to the same thing I said about women marketing that's not the reason you make those picks but when you're trying to put the icing on the cake that is one of those things that makes you feel better about it scoot Henderson is the direct replacement for Damian Lillard even though you knew it was gonna take time I think it's part of the evaluation of that draft pick I'll say this I'll be pretty surprised at the end of the year we're still in full-on panic mode about Henderson I don't I don't think it's gonna look this bad the whole year I think there's a pretty good chance that come March April will look back and kind of laugh at how poorly he played early on I'm not saying it's gonna be on a superstar trajectory by the end of the year but I think we'll feel a lot better about it so yeah I would still I would still stick with scoot at 3 I think there's a pretty strong case for us our tops in there but if your factory in team and we're saying it is the Trailblazers that I think they still go Henderson as well can we pretty confidently say we flip a men in the car and it's not really anything that a man is not just barely played  well it's yeah it's it's not a knock against amen it's it's a credit to us are I already felt like going in they were pretty close obviously the NBA felt the same way they were drafted back to back and we've already seen that it's our tomson is a really good NBA player he's the only guy that I was looking at where I would be able to confidently say okay maybe the Blazers should have gone in that direction but there's still think there's enough upside with scoot Henderson no doubt in my mind especially with what I made you don't go once to do defensively and he has turned this team around us our tomson would fit them perfectly so that that feels like a very real swinging a Miss as of right now not knowing what I'm in Thompson's going to turn into yeah I still think you know the man is just such a incomplete grade the guys played four games he's played 67 total minutes and it's gonna be tough because Houston's playing pretty well they have depth you know I don't know that they're going to be you know looking to get him out there for 30 minutes a night like to try was with the saw for a while there so I think for now you know you have to lead us our tops and but genetically Brandon a men should be able to do a lot of what is Sr does so I would not have that one either yeah I think so we go and weapon Yama Miller Henderson Azar Thompson is are we giving them the benefit of the doubt is he still at five years that were Derek Lively slides up  do they need a Derek Lively when they have when they have Durant  I this is where it's tough to place men because we haven't seen it I think this is I think this would be where the Pistons are so directionless they just need the best player that they could possibly get their hands on their Lively is already looked like a legit NBA Talent so yeah I will be I will confidently put Derek life must slide him up to the five spot where the Detroit Pistons end up with with Lively and that gives the Pistons a seventh Center on this roster so that's a little bit but yeah yeah well they don't seem to care why not throw another one in the mix you know with Lively it's tough because you do wonder what the ceiling is and most of the time if you're if you're taking a pick in the top five you're not saying I hope you get a good role player Center you know for the next 10 years but I think that's exactly what he's going to be and there's a lot of classes where you read draft and say all right you know who are actually the most you know the five to seven most valuable players of the draft you're not gonna get five like perennial All Stars in any class you're going to get guys who are impacting the game and other ways and you know there's a lot of players that went at the top 10 who have really not done anything yet you know Anthony black Jared's Walker Taylor Hendricks has played two games Jett Howard like we like we talked about he's played five games so like Lively pretty easily passes just about everybody who went ahead of him in the middle of the first round it's just a question of you know do you take him over either of the top since or over scoot  yeah and now we're on to to my squad the Orlando Magic and  I struggle with this one because Anthony black is a pretty perfect direct replacement for Mark help faults and he fits in perfectly personality wise with the best basketball team like he is exactly the type of character player that you need for what this magic team is trying to assemble so there are aspects of Anthony black that absolutely work for this team but we just haven't seen him really do anything yet  I think I would take a swing here because the magic still struggle offensively that is their biggest Bugaboo keyonte George has shown that he is an excellent offensive Talent already in the NBA I think if I were redrafting today if I'm if I'm really trying to rework and remaster this thing I think I would take keyonte George in that six spot I think there's a case for it I wonder how much you would be playing in like almost any other system right because Utah yeah just doesn't have a lot of cards they're kind of just winging it this year I certainly like what I've seen on the good nights the bad nights have still been you know wanting in some ways but you know the scoring has been there of late the assistant been pretty consistent he went through a stretch or get a bunch of steals that's kind of cool off of late but you know he's still so proud is a pretty down Knight still Proto turnovers shoot under 40% from the field and the three-point shooting has not been good and that's really dragging down its overall field goal percentage but I think if you're you know if you're Orlando a team that's always looking forward you're not necessarily because with what a guy looks like this year you know it's more so you know what can he be two or three years from now so is that is that really where the thinking comes from well in and that's where I and that's where the thinking came from with drafting Anthony black like the fact that he's starting for them right now that's not what they drafted him to do he just to be pretty poised and comfortable out there and isn't somebody that needs to be involved in order to to feel like he has a purpose out on a basketball floor so in that way that's what I that's part of what I mean by he fits perfectly right now for what the makeup of this team is but I I guess I I'm looking at it that's the way that they they look at it is they're looking at this long term because they're going to take the patient managerial approach I'm looking at this more of a microwave situation where I want to see this team score the basketball better than they have been and and I felt like there were so many opportunities in this draft for them to attack that at 6 at 11 and they and they haven't really solved those problems but it also you know you'd have to move like Cole Anthony around and all of that so it causes a ripple effect of issues they made the decision they made for a reason but I think in hindsight just this was a good year to attack the offense of issues and I don't  think they did that  I think there is a case for Jordan Hawkins there I think you know you could maybe make an outside case for like Brandon Punjab ski but the other guy we have not mentioned and I think someone maybe even take him a spot higher what do we do with Jaime Hawkins that was gonna be the next guy on my list yeah but Jaime is in such a perfect situation right yeah am I am I really that confident that if I just put him on any of these other rosters that he's gonna Thrive the way that he has when he landed in Miami I went oh my God could this be any more perfect with the type of player that he is the heat culture and he's getting an opportunity to shine early on I think what we're seeing is very much heat dependent and not so much Jaime hockey is dependence so I I'm maybe if I was like Toronto because I haven't seen much from gradey dick like I'd probably still push him up to draft board but  not much for I wouldn't push him into the top 10 based on what I seen  I think I would I think he's got to go somewhere in the mid to late top 10 you know it's like how do you say you still take Taylor Hendricks over him and I think you know Hendrix Walker who knows you know even cool about he's played minutes but he's still so raw like any of those guys could turn out to be fine that's the old those guys are drafted because they have like they have this freakish size and athleticism that you have to sort of grow into Jaime jaquez is who he is that's why he's a perfect Heat player  he is who he is and I you know low ceiling compared to some of those other players but I also yeah I think if we look back in 10 years you like I just pulled up randomly the 2013 NBA draft sorted by wind shares Giannis number one go bare number two Steven Adams number three and it's like I think Hawkins could be one of those guys who sneakily you know we never think of as a superstar by any means but what do you go back and some guys have to be hit so guys inevitably busted in a given draft class I think he's gonna end up breaking pretty high and you know we're 20 games in so who knows but I do think you know there's some staying power here even if a lot of it is him just being drafted into the perfect situation  all right let's let's hit some listener questions here we got to read that we got to take care of first but after that we will go through the list of listener questions you guys could keep throwing those in there we'll hit as many as we can but we do want to remind you that we are brought to you by Underdog fantasy the number

bonus at underdog all right let's see what we got here Brandon  Panic level on Kessler and Scoot fittingly  let's see do I want to go like 1 to 10 10 being I'm freaking out wondering I'm cool as a cucumber  I'm gonna go with a I'm gonna go with like a four for Walker Kessler it's more of a jazz problem than it is a Kessler issue in my opinion this team is not advancing with I thought they would this season that was expecting anything drastic but actually seems like they're sliding in the other direction and Walker Kessler just seems like he's caught up in that you still get blocks from him you know he he's still he's still he's still similar to the player that he was last year but I think you invested in him to become a better player this season for scoot Henderson I would probably be closer to the eight rain just because it looks so clunky out there think it's gonna take so much time that by the time he becomes a fantasy reliable option you will have well moved on from him this is a  Kyle pits NFL type situation to me where it's like the talents right there you want to hold on to it but at what point are you gonna feel comfortable with it yeah that's fair it was scoot for Fantasy I'm gonna say like a seven I think you gotta be realistic about what the ceiling is you know we made the entity Edwards comp last week  Edwards had an awesome rookie or barely finished in the top 100 so yeah you just gotta be realistic about expectations I think it'd be better I'm not panicking that he's going down as like a total bust I think he was such a strong prospect that I'd be pretty surprised if that's how this thing goes Kessler I'm at like a two I actually think he's played pretty well look like he's like way better since he came back from injury the shop blocking is come back over the last five you know what's the minutes return hopefully I mean it's weird that they're bringing him off the bench and all that like I don't really know what the point of that is but I do think he's gonna be just fine I mean last five games 11 points eight boards three blocks 60% from the field in 25 minutes so if you get to 28 2930 he's gonna be right where he was last season if not better  Harden or Bain rest of season in a points League  hmm I think I'm still gonna go Desmond Bane he a John Moran should be back any minute now right this is 25 games suspension but I like the way that this team should be able to come back together and be an old version of themselves and Desmond Baines settling more into his role as a heater from three and and a huge secondary option to what John Morant wants to bring to this team offensively James Harden is still just so  tough to trust in this in this Clippers offense I don't think they've figured out exactly what they want to be yet and there's only so many balls to go around  I think I would give slightly and hardened at a points league with Bane it's like the three-point shooting becomes a little bit less valuable and hardness you know sneakily kind of getting back to doing what he's doing like the the county stats aren't as overwhelming but like in category leaks he's borderline top 30 on the year now and it really hasn't felt that way but he's just he's always been even at his Peak You could argue like a better fantasy player than a real life player as far as how he impacts the game so I think I would actually lean hard in there but it's really close I mean if you're if you have both those guys on your roster or you're trying to like trade one of them I don't know I don't think I really would I think they're both really good guys to hold yeah I mean a hardened in the last few games 21 21 points nine assists 18.7 assists 26.6 is this it five steals three games ago so yeah he's the last couple of games he's definitely turned it around all right we got another panic question hey guys how high is the Panic on Emanuel quickly did he finally get tibbedeaux  and hard to figure out exactly what's going on with the Knicks this team is so hot and cold you never know what quite what we gonna get from this team last night I think was troubling for some of those role guys just 19 minutes played for him one of seven shooting if he's not making a shots and he's helping this team improve on the defensive end and yeah he's gonna I get tipped I like the way that they were to that I think that there's there's a real chance that that's happening  there's a chance at happening but there's also a good chance that I think he goes back to playing more minutes and at some point too I mean tips kind of does truck tend to trust his guys and yeah I guess what is the trade-off here more Devon chenzo off the bench you know maybe even more Josh Hart I I really like quickly I have met on one of my most important teams you know got off to a really nice start and yeah even a week ago he was still you know had 2018 23 consecutive games so I'm not I'm not in a full-on panic the season long numbers are pretty nice still he isn't a bit of a shooting so you know it could tip that's a short lease right it could just be something where you put two of ten the other night he was one of seven yesterday and it's like with quickly if he's not hitting shots there's really not a huge purpose for him to be out there so they have had a shorter leash that you would like but I if we're going one to 10 on this one I would say like a four for me yes three games in a row where he's played sub 20 minutes and he's shot 14% 50% in 20% from the field that's not gonna keep him on the court for  all right you need to drop one in a nightcat league nazri update George or Scott Henderson  hmm  is it is it safe to say that that I'm out on scoot in fantasy  or is that overreaction area at this point ah I don't think so I mean specially in an Ikat League what you got turnovers factored in for me it's either him or keyonte George I would  I would be a little more concerned about a potential second half scoot breakout where you would regret having dropped him  with keonte though I mean both of them are relatively High turnover players keonte Georgia shooting 34% from the field and he's taken a lot of shots so that is that is harming your field goal percentage pretty notably and get into category league so that's something you have to consider to me it's getting out there I would I would hold Nazarene especially because he's probably Center eligible yeah I mean the shooting percentage is for scoot Henderson are just it it's hard to justify if you're relying on that  oh no  I thought I think your video was frozen I could tell if you were just trying to hold yourself extremely still  I'm on my back am I here it's so weird oh my and nothing is happening yeah the internet is bad been you know scheming against us this entire episode but we will we will persevere as we always do  John Collins and Malcolm Brogden or Pascal saieko I assume this is a two-for-one trade question  hmm I think I'd rather have the sea Occam side mm-hmm I feel like we've already seen the best of Malcolm Brogdon this year  and and John Collins just doesn't really do it for me so give me the give me the high upside of Pascal siakam he's put together some monster games over the last couple of weeks not trying to get rid of that  okay yeah I I think for right now  the value is on the college side like those guys have combined to be more valuable than siakam but I think you're right I think the outcome is starting to turn things around it does look like you know the shop blocking is just not gonna come for him not that you ever expected to get two blocks I'll see him but he's just not doing anything there the steals are way down as well but he is at nightly 27 and 5 which is super valuable so yeah rest of season I've probably takes the outcome  interesting one here Keegan Murray or Chris Middleton you got to slumping second year three-point Specialist or a guy Middleton we know we know who he is but we also have no idea if he's ever going to play more than 27 minutes for a week yeah I'm gonna fade the the injury bug here and the age with Chris Middleton give me Keegan Murray to at some point pop off and return to the form that he was at last year for a really good offense I would be surprised if at some point he doesn't come barreling back so high or hold on Kobe white in PJ Washington  I think you can sell High I struggled with the Kobe white thing because I I really like him as a player and they're clearly done with Zach LaVine he hasn't been playing as of late and they're gonna trade him at some point if they can find anybody to take him at a reasonable price I think Kobe White's fantasy value could soar because of that they're going to play much more a team Billy Donovan type basketball so I'm a little hesitant on that because I think his best days could be in front of him up behind him and and PJ Washington is a player that's always gonna have a very solidified role for Steve Clifford in the Charlotte Hornets so I'm gonna say hold on both of them  yeah I would rather sell PJ Washington and he's always been a favorite of mine you know he sent her eligible like I feel like I have my on every team because you could just kind of get him for free at the end of a draft and he  excuse me as we were he's grabbed a bunch of boards and hitting threes you know even keeps a pretty good field goal percentage for somebody who takes a lot of Threes so I find old both of those guys I have a hard time believing you know at a 12 team League that they're significantly better options on the waiver wire maybe there are but you said about Kobe white like I would be terrified to drop him because I think they're trading within and yeah Alex and I talked about this a lot on Mondays pod but there is a world in which you know they trade him and bring back I don't know D'Angelo Russell or something you know from the Lakers or a young guard that they want to get a look at it's not a guarantee that Kobe white is locked in the 35 minutes a night  but I think if they trade especially if they trade DeRozan and Levine  I think that's pretty likely so I I Think You're Gonna Want to Hold Kobe white you probably got him at the way end of a draft maybe he wasn't even drafted in your league and I think that's gonna pay pretty major dividends the rest of the way  Giannis tyus Jones and Mike Collins I assume John Collins Janice Giannis and Colin's or Laurie marketing Jalen Brunson and Jared Allen  oh yeah the Mike Collins things throwing me off a little bit yeah  it's Jones man I watched him with the Amway Center a few nights back the they were in town for back-to-back set you talk about somebody completely lost in an offense I mean he just it is it's Kyle kuzma ball and then everyone's in a while Jordan Poole just starts chucking up shots and he doesn't know what to do with himself he just looks completely out of out of place I'm sure that he's looking back and saying that he wished she never left Memphis I'm not giving up on yonas though I'm not I'm not trading honest  it's a fair deal honestly because I think the next three best players at the trade are marketed Brunson and Alex so I actually think you're getting a pretty decent deal here honest at a point silly though I mean so so tough to give up I get that but I think there's a pretty strong case for The Other Side here too it kind of depends what you need what your situation is in that League you know if you're if you have you honest now and you're in like Ninth Place and you're like it's just not working I would say I would say switch it up you know this is I almost view this as like a two for three type of trade because you know between Tyson and college you never really know what you're gonna get weak to week whereas Market in Brunson Jared down those guys are way more consistent  yeah you gonna get you know you're gonna get that usage from Brunson leads the league with 8.2 minutes of possession time per game there's not a lot of guys that are gonna that are going to give you that so I I agree with Nick and this in the sense that it really depends on where you are in the standings but if my teams doing well right now I'm keeping on us  yeah good point good nugget on that that brought some step by the way let's say we got a question from Cal Chad TTV  how much Panic for pistons not named Cade rest of season is this massive hit everyone is taking purely bogged in bogdanovich's return coaching are they just the Cleveland Browns or the NBA drafting bad players  that all the above is very possible yeah the return of bojan has gone about as expected you know I I still don't really know what they're thinking because the Detroit Pistons don't operate on logic like some other franchises do so is it a trade audition for bug data bitch or is he just gonna play 30 minutes a night neither of those would really surprise me you can't trust them night tonight you know Jane Ivy will have a week where he plays 12 minutes off the bench and then he's starting in playing 28 minutes they're slashing a sar Thompson of all people's minutes the one guy who's been like really good for them this year  they they're just the best man they're completely mess there's a reason that they've won four games in the last like 10 months yeah the Pistons are completely directionless it's sad this was a once proud franchise that has no idea what they want to be who they want to build around but still when you look at Kate Cunningham's numbers I mean he's still putting up a decent stat line so I think the Panic on Katie Cunningham is a little bit overstated but I understand if you want to get out of the Piston's business I'm completely on board with that would you trade Aaron Gordon for Jabari Smith in a 10 team points League  Maybe  10 till the I mean you're talking bottom of your roster and attend Timur right I mean these are guys that are probably not shifting your fortune one way or the other I think I would man I actually like what I've seen from Jabari Smith over the last couple of weeks I mean early on it felt like here we go again with him but you know he still he still not giving you a tan outside of points and rebounds you got to keep that in mind but you know shooting over 55% from the field over his last seven games you know he's taking more threes he's getting to the line a bit more as well not that the percentage just matter all that much in a points league but I think I would chase the upside with Jabari Smith partially because you know like we said it's probably your last spot when you're starting lineup or maybe even a bench spot so I'd rather I'd rather play with some upside there right yeah there's still a chance that he explodes into a different level of player Aaron Gordon is extremely comfortable and solidified and being the defensive stopper for the Nuggets if yet absolutely have to get a bucket it's mostly it's mostly put back opportunities for Aaron Gordon they have enough guys that can score the basketball where he can go games where he's just simply not involved and and that's not a discredit to him the fact that he's settled into a spot in his NBA career where he doesn't feel like he needs to score to be valuable a lot of guys really find out find it very difficult to ever get to that point mentally but yeah with Jabari Smith I'll be honest completely pessimistic to start the year I thought here we go there's not enough balls to go around but I actually really buying into what I mean I may do because doing over there and Jabari Smith it seems to be settling into a much more comfortable role  all right Admiral Nita asks our Ben Simmons Wendell Carter Junior and Chris Middleton by Lowe's right now  I think I would qualify all of them into that category I'm not sure that I want to buy them but they're definitely in the Bible  yeah I would I think window Carter absolutely a buy low for me he was out there in I think it's one of the  you know for a player like that to be out there right now like I get you know it's been frustrating he's been hurt for a while but yeah especially if you're in a deep performance I think he's somebody that's gonna be valuable Middleton it's just kind of you know what do you expecting versus what do you have to give up you probably have to trade for him if you could if you could give up a relatively low upside player you know I don't know if you could do like Titus Jones for Chris Middleton I think I would consider that  you know even even if Middleton plays 27 to 29 minutes both nights the rest of the way like you still giving you what like 13 6 and 6 and maybe that's six to six six and four without looking but you still a good player like he's been fine it's just you know like if you if you look at this per 36 he's kind of right where he's been for the last couple of years it's not a I'm not convinced that he's like that diminished of a player I think they're just being really really careful with his workload and rightfully so because absolutely you know lower body is an issue yeah I mean the their goal isn't to be the top seed 25 games into the season they've they've got bigger aspirations in that so and he's somebody who's dealt with injuries so they're going to play it safe with him Wendell Carter Junior I still have no idea when he's coming back but I can tell you that I know that he's working his way back so it should be sooner rather than later and good luck guessing on Ben Simmons  Ryan Duncan asks should I trade Paul George in Anthony Edwards for SGA at a point sleep wow yeah that's too much yeah that's a little that when I want to have SGA on my squad but that's that's a little that's a little too rich for me as well  yeah I mean that's too that's like two top 25 guys that you're giving up and I know SGA is the number one guy so there's a case that maybe it is worth it do you think it depends on how big the league is is there a size of League where you'd be more comfortable with this  not necessarily I don't know I mean if it's  yeah I guess it like a much shallower League than you know theoretically if you if you hit on some of your early picks you might have some other stars to fall back on that's possible like if you if you attend Team league in your team is sort of loaded  yeah right I don't know I just I think  it's special when you're not really worried about the field goal percentage because that's part of the reason that sga's been so awesome is actually in category leaks is he's not only giving you 30% six with two and a half steals which is outrageous but he's also shooting 54% from the field 94% at the line I mean he's having a like a yogic level dominant number one overall player season but in Portugal those percentages don't really help you as much so I don't I just don't think the combined value of those two is worth it you know if you're just kind of adding up like you know what is the raw production for these two players versus SGA I feel like it's gonna be quite a bit higher you know if you say four games a week for each of them AdWords plus George to be is more valuable than SGA absolutely I I think if and if you're in terms of Ryan who asked that question if you're going through that process where you really want to pull the trigger on that you've got to look at who's on your bench do you feel so confident about who you're inserting into your lineup now that you're taking somebody off of it to where that trade makes sense so I think it's very roster to pendant but I'm with Nick I think it's a little too rich  all right well hit four or five more of these and we got to be out of here let's see  well sure Dennis asked aldama or Suggs  I mean come on I'm not going to get my guy's been playing great I don't what is Marcos coming back that's the question because if this thing if this knee issue is just going to be something that dogs in the entire year which I'm starting to thinking might be then to me it's clearly sucks yeah here's the thing I'm not sure that it changes Jalen Suggs stat projection all that much markelle fultz is going to primarily be a distributor in the offense and and not a whole lot else more what Jalen Suggs is giving you is a whole lot of defense and that's not going away and it's three point shooting has been a lot better markelle fultz isn't coming back and stealing threes from Jalen Suggs so as long as that 3-point shooting stays up we know the defense is going to stay there this guy is is  he's angling for a new contract so he's you're getting him in that sort of that Peak motivation portion of his career definitely not moving off of him I think if you got him on your roster what a steal and fantasy I didn't see coming at the start of the year  did I freeze again  so we have a follow-up on the SGA trade question from Ryan so he says you know Paul George and Edie for SGA and he possibly be getting puddle as well the deal which it's nice little sweetener 10 team points League he has job Eric coming back and Simon's coming back I got this team is gonna be loaded and wanting to upgrade to get another 50-point player yeah in that case I mean I'm not gonna tell you to not go get SGI I just think you might be able to do it for Less I mean Paul George and Eddie Edwards are two big Big Tymers right and you know maybe you think Paul George is gonna get hurt history would suggest you will in that case you know then that it becomes much more worth it I would just see if you could do one of those guys and then another you know even offer like offer like Java ranted Paul George or John rant and Anthony Edwards you know Simon's possibly I just I wouldn't want to give up both of those guys yeah but I appreciate the the added context because I think that's exactly why you make a move like that it does make a lot more sense now  all right gotta drop one Lively or not read  yeah I don't want to drop Derek Lively I think this Dallas team what they did the other night was just insane the 30 point run even though they lost some still I'm gonna end up backing the Dallas Mavericks tonight just off of Just sheer respect for their ability to do that but their Lively I love what he's brought to this team and I'm not willing to move off of him  Kauai or siakam in a nine category League our question asked her would be trading Hawaii for sea accum in this situation I think I'd rather have I think I'd rather have Kauai their point totals are similar enough and I would expect Kawhi Leonard's defensive stats to uptick there's been a little bit down but yeah I think I think I'd rather have Kawaii  they're really similar players statistically yeah they are excuse me I would probably  I would probably take siakam just for the security although guys been he's been healthy like it feels like it one of the nice surprises the season so far is that load management is just not really been a topic  like at all it's special compared to last year and you know Kauai is the  front and center player when it comes to that so maybe that changes as a year goes along Hawaii is the better fantasy player right now it's just a matter of you know what's his game Count going to be versus Seahawk and but yeah I think you just don't want to get suckered in on Kauai you know because he always feel like that injury is coming or that mysterious you know I was these started to act up and he's in and out so if you're if you're doing well in your league and you want to you know add some security I would go see Occam  I just traded marketing and Brooke Lopez for Lillard and nurkic this a winner or a loss  I'd say it's about a wash I probably rather have marketing Lopez  yeah I would agree  it Damian Lillard starting to really turn it on and his numbers over the last 10 games have been tremendous  right  yeah it's definitely not like a major major L here  but I yeah I don't know it's closed I just think I think if I ranking these players in order Lillard one marketing into Lopez 3 Norwich 4 so you know you got the best player in the worst player of the deal you gave up two and three I think usually that's fine it's just the question is how big is the gap between Lillard and marketing at the end of the season like can Lillard can he climb up to being like the 8th best fantasy player in category leaks if so then you probably won the trade yeah well if it helps marketing's out tonight so makes you feel a little better about it  all right  yeah we love to see that for the just you know absolute wagon of a roadway or State team for for your your host here that's the last thing we needed was marking going down and this is just been a nightmare situation anyway all right we got one or two more in us here Brandon let's see 12 team 9 cat hunting rebounds in field goal percentage would you rather have Marcus Smart or Malik Beasley and Spencer Dinwiddie  so I think it's smart versus Beasley and Dinwiddie  well man I really not intrigued by any of them Marcus Smart just hasn't been around and didn't witty's been so hot and cold  I think I'd rather have Beasley and Dinwiddie  I think if you're not worried about field goal percentage then yeah didn't we become a lot more appealing so that's the way I would lean as well  let's see  should I trade my Karl Anthony towns for Ingram and then he follows up and says a buddy of mine hates Ingram just want to see if he's worth trading for my car at the Italians yeah I mean you gotta take advantage of these situations in fantasy league if somebody hates somebody make sure you target them I would not trade cat for Ingo know  I would not do that um I got so much better fantasy player I know there's been some health issues the last few years I'm not too worried about that I would keep God every time yeah you're just you're losing too many of the category the key categories of fantasy in that regard they're close enough in points where it's sort of a wash their cats are better rebounder he's a better shot blocking artist shoots a better field goal percentage free throw percentage 3% is just better across the board  yeah not much of a debate there for me either all right we gotta cut it off here good stuff guys appreciate all the questions in the chat as always please like subscribe
