welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy Vivid Seats and rival fantasy it's Friday November 17th 2023 Alex barutha here was Shannon McEwen and Ken k train Crites all aboard  let's jump right into the news we had Jimmy Butler last night having excellent game against the Nets 36 points on 1219 shooting with three blocks two threes five boards the Heat won 122 to 15 my Miami seven game winning streak right now all back up to eight and four after losing four straight we still have Tyler hero out for a little bit but we've gotten some interesting contributions from other guys like Duncan Robinson back to fancy relevancy back to basketball relevancy in general  yeah I mean I Robinson I will mention more in the waiver wire section but four straight starts  red hot it's six of ten threes last night  this is the Dunkin' Robinson they're paying for so I'm sure Riley's happy yeah Robinson Hayward I'm sorry Hi Smith Heywood Highsmith who we talked about a little bit last week Highsmith with the kind of a lackluster performance last night two for five from the floor 6 points one rebound zero assist zeros everywhere else he did play 23 minutes and if you are familiar with high school game at all he's gonna do this he's gonna put up some goose eggs but he's gonna have some good outings too I think he had like a five steal outing one or two games prior there's going to be some inconsistencies but I still think he's a streaming option and like 14 teams the gun on another stinker from Kyle Lowry yet still won this thing I mean Butler really put this team on their back but  haven't seen the Kyle Lowry Peak we were hoping for when hero first got injured know he at least got three steals which basically saved his entire family line by itself  let's go to La the Clippers host the Rockets tonight  Clippers are trying to break their six game losing streak thanks for joining us James Harden it how bad is the situation in LA are we overreacting these guys are gonna figure it out or do you think they'll be fighting for the ball all season guys  I  I think it's I mean  they don't look good but I think they're I think they can at least you know get up to a 500 level I don't think we're gonna look back at this Clipper season and be like well I can't believe they went you know  40 and it's just like  I I think the problem right now is  honestly having Russell Westbrook in the starting lineup which is not fair to Westbrook who's played really well but you have him in there he doesn't space doesn't space and then it just creates a bunch of issues within the offense yeah I personally am not worried about it I always takes these teams a long time to gel create the chemistry adding a piece like hardened is very involved you know it's not not the same as like a 3D guy a wing player into your rotation this is the guy who's gonna need the ball in his hands and even hardened I know there's a quote this week where he referenced the fact that he didn't really have training camp or preseason this year you know somewhat self-inflicted there but he mentioned he's still kind of getting back in getting that rust off getting into game shape and he believes that they're going to be dangerous once they kind of blow off all these cobwebs I agree do I think they're a legit Contender yet no but but I also think they'll be fine and when more games than they lose hardened had a funny quote too or he said  you know if he felt like for so many years he's always had to create his shot he's not used to getting open catching threes catching shoots but with this Clipper lineup you know they're doubling other guys he said he has to relearn how to do easy catching shoots which he hasn't done since back to his OKC days just to relearn how to shoot the ball when he's wide open that's crazy hunting assist and highlights wow Alex tell us about I'm going to call it just concerning news and Charlotte uh yeah there's a log of adjectives you can use to describe this news which I'm sure everybody will eventually get to Miles Bridges returning from his suspension tonight the man is not played in 500 and 583 days  coach Steve Clifford said that Bridges will be playing a significant role right away I don't know what that means nobody actually knows what that means but Shannon and there's only so many minutes to go around on the Charlotte team we've seen PJ Washington have a nice start to a season Brandon Miller's been a little up and down but his minutes you know he's been he's been trying to towards 30 minutes of course in Hayward playing exceptionally well to Terry Rozier has been out eventually Terry rozier's gonna come back and Bridge is gonna be there how I mean  how are you analyzing this  yeah it is pretty tough you know you like you mentioned you got lamelo Scary Terry Gordon Hayward PJ Washington Mark Williams those five have been locked in the starting lineup all season when healthy and then Brandon Miller of course number two overall draft pick you want to get him some run so where does miles Bridges fit in you know I think I don't think the starters or Brandon Miller are going to be the ones impacted too much here because you have a lot of hey I mean so someone's going to eventually but  you have a lot of backups who have been playing 20 minutes per game for this team miladawn has 18.8 minutes per game in 10 appearances JT Thor who had picked up a spot start recently when when Miller and Scary Terry were both out he he's averaging 20 minutes per game and he got Nick Richards that Center I think you're going to see a lot of items where when Mark Williams go to the bench it'll be PJ Washington and to the five to get bridges in there and different combinations like that and it's going to impact those backup players more where Theo miladawn or JT Thor you know average 10 minutes per game and said 20 like they currently are when I first heard that quote from Clifford I was like why you know Bridges is on a one-year deal you're going to stump Mark Williams development you're going to stump Brandon Miller's development  you gonna hold back PJ Washington  to give big minutes to Miles Bridges who  I would argue should not be on an NBA court right now for the off the court stuff he's done like I I just don't understand that quote just when I first started I was like just the logic made no sense to me unless he he's talking short-term because Rosie's out or something but I don't get it at all I mean I think they're trying to win games like I think I think the organization believes hey we won 40 games at your Bridges popped off I think they think hey we can get back to that and we have Brandon Miller now Mark Williams is really good we're gonna we're gonna be cooking there's three and seven right now so a lot of work to do obviously in the Eastern Conference  we also had some news  from a few days ago the Bulls and Zach LaVine have sort of been in mutual discussions about moving on from each other and I think by extension that also means you are probably looking to move on from DeMar DeRozan and Nicola vujevich the rosens I don't expire in deal with Levine have longer term deals so they can be a little more difficult to move and that sense Ken if you're rostering Levine booch DeRozan in fantasy are you trying to I don't even know if sell high is the right word in this situation the problem is anybody buying but what are your thoughts if you have those guys in your team I don't think it was buying I think you trade for Zach Lavine team does that because they want him to gun and shoot you know on their roster so I don't I don't really see Levine's I mean if anything  you know they've got this three-headed monster in Chicago they might fall into higher usage situations right I mean DeRozan  has that habit of kind of pounding you know pounding the ball and a little too much and setting up his mid-range jumper might we might see a boom from boots of itching Levine in a new location so I'm not sure I'm anxious to deal either of them  DeRozan's having certainly disappointing season  and what is he 36 now I mean I'm sorry 34  I do worry he's hitting the wall he's shooting a  for him a wildly low 43% after back to back over 50% seasons  he's shooting it's through a 11 games but really scares me no one's gonna be giving you a much value for DeRozan right now on the other side I'm kind of intrigued maybe we finally see Patrick Williams  brings deliver on some of the promise you know he was kind of a sleeper favorite for lots of folks but the there's been no use for him maybe they clear out some  Shots by moving these vets and we find you know that Bulls need to find out what they have in Patrick Williams I think he's gonna be restricted free agent this summer  you think there's anybody worth stashing Shannon or is it kind of risky outside like Kobe White  yeah that's the tough question with the bulls if you take a look at their depth chart they don't have any of those young developing pieces that are what I would consider building blocks for a potential rebuild so you'd have to assume they're gonna acquire those pieces in whatever trades they make you know even even Pistons Twitter was was clamor and for Zach LaVine and I'm like I am not for that but in that scenario you'd have to think the Bulls would get a killing these or a ivy a young guard to plug in there again I don't think that's going to happen I don't think it's what the Pistons want to do but their front office is gonna probably be feeling some fire soon and desperate to make a move but looking at the Bulls roster in depth chart there there's not a lie I mean Kobe white they did just resign him so he's they're committed to him for the next couple Seasons after this year he'll get a bump I mean he'll soon who could get a bump even you know a guy like Jevon Carter even though he's not a young building piece he could get a temporary bump you know looking at the front Court yes Patrick Williams Patrick Williams had a decent game on Wednesday I don't DeMar DeRozan said out and Patrick Williams had 30 fantasy points you know didn't light up the scoreboard 9 points nine rebounds two assists one steal two blocks you know spread it out enough to get to reach that 30-point Mark for fantasy points and that's back-to-back games so he's the guy who I would look to scoop up but there's not much else on that roster right now that I think I would be running into the waiver wire to grab Drummond could be interesting if they move absolutely look at a big in return Drummond's always been good at the Steals and blocks  that could be he could be a fun streaming option if they move much  we're approaching our fan feedback but first a word from Underdog fantasy Underdog fantasy is the number one platform for MBA best ball and DFS player Pick'em contests if you haven't tried

fan feedback questions from the live stream here on the YouTube's in the Twitter's got a question here thoughts on Marcus faults  on a fort on a 14 team 9 category League faults of course dealing with I think some neat and tonight is yeah fultz is um I think on a 14 team you're good to keep him on a 12 team I would understand if you're feeling impatient or worried about knee tendonitis of course tendonitis I shouldn't say of course tendonitis is a rest injury you have to just stay off of it so that kind of creates issues obviously when your job is to play professional basketball he's missed six of the past seven  again 14 team is deep enough to where it's like folks can get you five six assists a game when he's back maybe a steal and a half  that's pretty that's worth keeping us if you can stash them on IR  but shallower League's I understand wanted to just stream the spot and statically with how good Jalen songs is loved his upside is limited I would say yeah I mean I'm in agreeance I'm in agreeance with Al unfolds 14 teams I think you hold 12 teams there could be a streaming option that makes sense but I would value full at what he did in the 60 games he played last year that 14 points five five and a half five point seven assists I think he does get to that range you know assuming he gets full bill out here soon  all right one more question this one's from Brooks  would you drop Skylar Mays for keonte keynote George I take this one Shannon yes absolutely Skyler May's value is very temporary scoot Henderson will return very soon and when Henderson returns it's his team there is no question about that the Trailblazers need scoot Anderson to be to develop into like an All-Star caliber players so they're gonna give them every opportunity do so Skylar Mays is just benefiting from the fact that brogden's her scooter that's not going to last so I would I would pick up keynote I think keonte is  locked in as the starter for Utah I don't think they would have made that move unless they were prepared to keep him in the starting rotation for the remainder of the Season or at least until he totally blows it so as long as he continues performing keonte is my my favorite of those two  all right and  one last one for free key is Lively a 10 team hole  Derek Lively Dallas Maverick Center see a hole in 10 team leads I think he is because I think sooner than later the Mavericks are going to realize he's just clearly their best option at Center um you know and his minutes have been trending upward for most of the Season like to begin the year was a little more up and down now it's pretty consistent minutes in the 20s and he's looked great even in low 20s minutes I think he's definitely a whole because the chemistry is only gonna get stronger yeah I ten team where I think I would I would hang on  all right well that does it for a fan feedback section now it's time for our waiver wire Alex tell us about the waiver wire segments yes how we do the waiver wire segment is we have two regular picks each and then one long shot regular picks being roster in less than 50% of leagues long shots being rostered in less than 25% of League's although I will be breaking the rules and having a more varied waiver wire section than usual because we have plenty of names  we will warn you that the for two game weeks Dallas Detroit and OKC have two games next week so if you're thinking about picking up someone from those teams exercise caution if you've been streaming someone from those teams you can probably drop them uh my first waiver wire suggestion it's two-fold  either Dario saric or Jonathan kaminga from the Golden State Warriors you have Draymond Green suspended five games Steph Curry's also out I will assume for roughly the same amount of time Dario saric and the Wolves game that that Draymond got ejected from a 21 four and four with two Steals and 32 minutes game last night versus okay see sorry she had 12 points for sis three rebounds on a block in 24 minutes coming up looked better than Sarge coming I had a great game against OKC 21 points on 13 shots got to the free throw line a good amount six rebounds to assist in a block golden state has three games next week Shannon if you had to pick between one of these two guys where would you go or does it depend on your league yeah it definitely depends on my team build my league my needs if I if I'm going for the moon and I want the higher upside then I'm gonna I'm gonna pick up Camino if I want something safer and more you know guaranteed long term value surprisingly it's Sarge Dario search has been very solid has a much bigger role Off the Bench for the Warriors tonight I expected this season I really expected most of those Ministry to Mega and based on his ADP I think most folks in in the fantasy world did but I still love coming as upside I think you know he flashed it last night like you said and I'm I'm silly enough to honestly believe  that at this stage of their careers the Warriors would be better off giving more of Dreams minutes if not even the starting role to comingo but maybe I'm a crazy person Sarge does qualify its Center to your point about what are your team needs on Yahoo and  I'm gonna jump into my first pick very familiar name on the waiver wire and that's Duncan Robinson of the Miami Heat he's rostered on 46% of Yahoo teams I should say first though if you like our videos please hit like And subscribe below  anyway back to my first pick Duncan Robinson of the Heat  Miami may have found their Max Drew's replacement which is funny because stress was supposed to be their Dunkin' Robinson replacement now streus is with the Cleveland Robinson has started the last four games  and over those starts he's averaged over 20 points four rebounds three point three assists and three point eight triples three-pointers are why you get Duncan Robinson plus one stock a game  the Heat have four games next week and Robinson qualifies as both a guard and forward on Yahoo I enjoy these Tyler Heroes out games while you can good week to stream Duncan Robinson yeah Robinson he's really he's looked a lot more confident this year he's expanded his game a little bit he's not just being a three-point chukar he remembered that he was six foot eight so he'll pump and drive and go to the rack I again you mentioned the assist too he's been passing well so this is as long as Heroes out Robinson you roster him and then I think you hold even when Heroes back just to see what happens  he could take heisman's starting spot wouldn't be shocking  Shannon where are you going on the waiver wire first  we're going to Washington below Kula Bali  the rookie top 10 pick what was he takes seventh overall that sound right something like that something yeah number seven overall in the draft Pacers too so it's kind of a weird swap thing yeah number seven overall Wendy Wendy's former Playmate cooler Bali is been very good for the for the Wizards over the past few games in the last three games 31.7 minutes off the bench 13.3 points 7.3 rebounds 2.3 Steals and 2.33 pointers made he is on a bit of a heater 70% from downtown over that stretch but a top 50 player over the last seven games he is only 32% rostered on Yahoo a cooler Bali he has diverse skill set can give you defensive stats I just think he's a solid streaming option and how many games we got we got four games for the Wizards next week I love them I love Mesa pickup when he you know when that 19 year old feels comfortable he's gonna be a Steals and block machine and they're gonna give them all the minutes he can take and Washington and as Alex pointed out to me yesterday when we were discussing our segment Kula Bali is beefed up its getting yoked he looks a lot different than he did in France last year he's enjoying the American food  they do one thing right in Washington and apparently it's powerlifting playing basketball not so much  okay who's your second pick out yeah my second pick is gonna be Dyson Daniels of the New Orleans Pelicans 17% roster  pelicans have four games next week  and since Daniel's has joined the Stargate lineup he's averaging 116 and 3 with 2 steals um you know like ferma column and Trey Murphy who are both still out them returning next week to me would be like a best case scenario I don't think it'll happen and the thing is even if it does teasing Murphy for a while I've got stashed a bunch of leaks like even if there's a 10% chance that those guys return they're not gonna play their full minus this week and there's four games so you're kind of insulated from that by rostering Daniels who is going to be good in both points and category leaks because he can he can stuff the stat sheet  yeah I like that pick up Daniel's star dated over Hawkins they like Daniel's point guard Hawkins more of a two and like you said I mean I honestly I think Murphy's at least a couple weeks out he just recently joined the team for shoot around but he's gonna need to get some 5.5 action you know knock off the rust before he's playing games again  kinda timeline little frustrating  Ken who's your second pick up I'm this is a stash and we talked about this in the news but the number two overall pick in this Summer's draft Brandon Miller of the Hornets has fallen below 50% roster levels on Yahoo now that's because one he's been dealing with ankle injury and two there's this miles Bridges news um but I love Miller as a stash until the 20 year old figures things out look Gordon Hayward is going to get hurt sooner or later he was playing out of his mind which is great I'm happy for him but he cannot stay healthy this bridge is situation is horribly frustrating and I think they'll quickly learn there's no future there on that one year deal  look Charlotte badly needs Brandon Miller to develop and they're really should be forcing him his minutes anyway I'm just recommending him as a stash if someone's grown impatient with the rookie  not bad um yeah I mean Nick and I already on our previous podcast highly advised everybody to sell high on Gordon Hayward and then immediately he scored like 8 points and pulled his hamstring so well we'll see how that turns out when Bridget comes back but yeah Miller's Miller's a fine stash Shannon who is your second waiver wire pickup  I was torn suggesting this player and I don't feel terribly confident about it but I feel like the past week it needs to be mentioned cam reddish for the Los Angeles Lakers he is currently in their starting lineup and he started four straight games over that stretch 30.8 minutes 15.3 points 2.8 Steals and 2.83 pointers as well shooting a ridiculous 53.7% from the floor and 52.4% from the 3.1 cam reddish you know has been a  top 40 player over the past seven days mostly because of those steals in three-pointers the Lakers are they have a three game week next week I don't expect this camera at his thing to be long-term but for as long as he's in that starting lineup playing 30 minutes and producing he's a streaming option so if you're if you have a roster that needs a streaming option and if you need Steals and threes camera is an option to consider yeah to me reddish is almost exclusively a steel streamer at least that's the only thing you should have confidence in when you pick up reddish because the man is a career 40% shooter from the field 32% from three but 1.6 Steals and half a block per 36 so if the magnets continue to be there that's that's essentially what you're looking for  my long shot this week  can your muted  you're still muted  I sorry coughing fit go ahead Alex go ahead um my long shot this week long shots actually  Jacob Gilyard of the Memphis Grizzlies and Brandon ski of the Golden State Warriors Gilyard still only 3% roster or about that much but gems he's up to 20%  Gillard for Memphis has started the past three games  and as even more upside now that Marcus Smart projects to miss time he's averaged 10 4 and 4 with two Steals and only one turnover in 26.3 minutes only saw 21 million to the latest game because they got blown out by the Lakers has ranked 83rd and per minute value and for his career per 36 8.2 points 6.8 assists 3.8 rebounds 2.0 steals he's a guy I actually went to pick up in multiple leagues last week but I had bids and Fab like Skyler Mays or somebody else that ended up basically canceling out the one for gailyard I guess as far as Brandon ski goes  we all know Curry's out  we'll see how long were supposed to get an update probably this weekend about Curry  so if you have Sunday waivers keep an eye out for that if Curry's gonna miss another week fire in pajama ski who's looked very good Chris Paul's son's Praises here to calling him air pods that's a lot easier to say than pajami a million times past two games for pajam ski 187 and 4 and 32 minutes per game  Ken who is your Longshot my long shot is someone we've repeated early on the show but Goga patitsa of Orlando he's only 17% rostered despite being the magic starting center the magic have four games next week  and Batista is now getting more minutes than Moe Vagner  hey per game ranked in nine category leagues over the last two weeks  but Pizza is a number 49 he ranks 49th in per game value he's shooting 60% from the field 80% from the line better rotisserie player than fantasy points League player  but but patitsa out there and 8 out of 10 League's go get him  yeah for as long as Wendell Carter Juniors out him and fagner pretty much going to split time both of them have 12 team relevancy especially in four game weeks yeah pick him up on four game weeks four game week  Shannon you have a long shot for us yes go into Miami triple soft J or the real Triple J how many hockey's Junior  for the Miami Heat over the past four games even even though it's only started one of these four games he is averaging 34 minutes per 14.5 points 14.5 rebounds 3.3 assists one steel and one and a half three-pointers  every time he steps on the court he just brings a good energy for the heat I love his skill set you can do it all I think he's a solid streaming option we've got the heat have four games next week his role I think will be in flux he is you know he is a rookie but it's super encouraging he was he was in the rotation already before hero got hurt as well you know I I do see a path if wowie continues to show his age where Tribble soft J hero are both in the starting lineup alongside Butler it might not happen in the very near future  but how kids junior is worth a look if you're you're cool with up and down play and second half of the Season upside yeah I I love this pickup Hawkins is like the perfect Miami Heat player it does a little bit of everything you mentioned it cut Lowery Lowery could also get hurt and then I opens up forward minutes I think Hawk has is better than both Highsmith and Kevin Love so and there's gonna be a lot of situations where they probably prefer him over Robinson when everyone's healthy so I think you can look them up you know start them on this four game week but don't don't like Panic drop them immediately because he he might have rest of season Valley in deeper leaks but maybe 12 as well  okay we also have a drops section in this podcast now  do we have we we sort of answered the question about Mark health fultz or earlier about knee tendon and I guess I think if you're giving a 12 team or maybe you can like him go anything deeper probably hang on we also continued and I got I get this question with Nick all the time what we do with Jabari Smith Jr I  Shannon and I were on in disagreement on this I think last time we did this podcast I am still on my stance that I believe he is very he was droppable what do you think Shane are you still do you still think he's a hold I've changed a little bit Yeah I think last week I said I would even hold them in like 10 teams that's not the case anymore 10 teams he is certainly  droppable for 12 team weeks depending on the depth I still think he's a hold in most 12 teams it just kind of depends on your roster building what you're fighting for if you have a roster where you would be better off streaming the flavor of the week  then do that if that's going to lead to more contributions for your team but if it if it's just a guy who's going to be on your bench for most weeks or most nights if it's a daily League's  then I would keep Smith because I believe he's still has far more upside than most players that are available on waivers  now the Pistons only have two games this week if you're in a 12 team League time to give up on Jayden ivy  you should give up on Jake and Ivy like after the third game maybe I mean I work though I mean you probably spent some draft capital on them people probably don't want to we we are in a shallow shallow 12 team points basically together I think all three of us are in it and I dropped him right away and that week probably the first Fab period that ran it just it just depends on leak size League depth but I do think we're gonna see a change to the Pistons rotation there's been a lot of Buzz about it recently Ivy there's a good chance Monty Williams might do something that's prizes Pistons fans but  I expect Ivy did Big be a bigger part of the rotation moving forward that said like 10 team 12 team leads like it like Alex is suggestion he probably should have been tossed away already just that first sign of like oh okay it looks like IVs going to be playing 25 plus minutes for game now every game that's when you want to skip them up  all right well that's it for our waiver wire section Alex tell us about

is the Kings at the Spurs at 237 and a half points  my goodness looks at Shannon take it away  well you all ask you straight up about this game first Shannon we have Devin of a cell out for the Spurs in this game Kelvin Johnson expected to play Trey Jones probably not playing so we have some usage open up on the Spurs in a high paced matchup is there anywhere you're looking on here and specifically what about Victor 1 Benn Jama  you're muted  sorry I was just trying to pull we call that pull in a can we be certainly worth a look in DFS lineups tonight I have them on my FanDuel lineup 8600 on FanDuel that's cheaper than Julius Randle you know the issue with Wendy when it comes DFS is just the the inconsistency right so he's got multiple 50 point outings three he's topped 50 I'm sorry for top 50 points fantasy points four times already this season but he has a couple sub 30 Games as well  obviously you know a game like this where it's fast paced there's gonna be a ton of points available he's a bit more appealing I also think it's you know Spurs are at home King's are solid team but they're not a world beater so it should be some competitive you know kings are currently favored by set 8.5 points yeah that's a lot but they should be at least close enough where it's not going to be a full-blown blowout so I like Wendy quite a bit so hand is another option and I apologize I don't know how to say this guy's name I always call them champagne what's the Julian champagne guys named Alex champagne  champagne champagne yeah champagne all right close enough you know I only forgot one or two syllables he you know Kelvin Johnson returned champagne he started for Kelvin Johnson and the last game had a big fan of audion tube determined you know Calvin Johnson's back but sells out so do they go with Branham at the starting to do they maybe go with the bigger lineup and have my boy champagne bottle in there again I don't know if champagne starts  I like him but I I'm not gonna I'm not gonna go off for for Brandon even if he's you know super cheap on DraftKings are FanDuel yeah and also in that game Sacramento is actually the team expected to score the most points on the entire slate 123 one interesting game I think we have Washington vs New York the Knicks in the first sort of slot the 7 p.m. eastern time slot this is the fastest Pace team in the NBA the Wizards versus the slowest Pace team in the NBA the next so if you're looking for the classic Pace up spot you have Nick's players available to you although Grimes and bear it are both questionable there are a lot of injuries on this late and like I'm looking at Barrett's questionable Janice's questionable Brandon Miller Gordon Hayward or questionable Garland and Mitchell or both questionable Brown and horses are both questionable I I'm gonna kick it to you can very quickly if  if Brown and poisonous are both out again as they were against the 76ers what could you see from that game aside from the obvious like Derek white looked awesome that kind of a thing  well yeah Derek white did look awesome and you know Ken shine when they need him to Tatum was happy to Dish you only had he only had 29 Points a hair below is average you know my buddies we had my usual neighbor and the bottle of bourbon out watching that upset over the Sixers  and we had said boy it really thought they would have lost if you said no Brown no brazing Tatum only has 29  but D white was fantastic Drew holiday was close to a triple double  man I I did not appreciate how strong holiday is on the Block both on offense and defense  but yeah Whitehall I actually be more tempted to go the white or Holiday Route then Tatum I think the obvious defensive Ploy is to double Tatum when Brown's not on the floor I expect to see that from Toronto I think a holiday in white or the bargains there well yeah oh yeah you I was gonna ask you about the Pistons but if you want to talk about the Celtics first I'll let you well idea I do just because with holiday I love holiday for tonight's late he's 6700 on FanDuel and you know he's coming off 40 plus fancy Point outing he's got a handful 40 plus Fantasy Point outings he hasn't he hasn't been asked to do a lot but you know if if the Celtics are short-handed again even in the game on Wednesday you know he said 10 rebounds great but he had three assists and only 18 points like there's going to be a game where he puts it all together he hasn't top 20 points yet in a game for the Celtics we all know he can score over 20 points rather easily so I am going with holiday in my DFS lineups one of these nights he's going to put it all together and have a total complete game but what about what I got another question Celtics question Sam Houser I was really bummed by his  you know he had a spot start  and he's been playing really well off the bench for him but he was a judge for DFS purposes in that spot start actually 16.4 fantasy points despite playing his season High 35 minutes yeah shocking because he had been on a heater from three I think he was over 50% it like last three or four games heading into that game I got to start with brown out I mean it's just all about whether he's hitting his threes or not he wasn't Wednesday you know I not great perimeter Defenders on the Raptor so how's there certainly could go off as well but it's just totally dependent on whether he's hitting those three-point shots or not dare you Bessemer Scotty Barnes like that  all right we so we know so this is a Pistons versus Cavaliers Central Division heavyweight Throwdown going down this evening we know Jalen Duren is out Marvin Bagley is also questionable  is there anything you would expect let's say bagley's out  is this a Wiseman play and  are you looking at the moblee Allen side of this as well because the Pistons are so beat up in the front Court the only concern I have about the Moberly Alan side of it is the blowout potential here you know a very this game could get out of hand or early and be over early you know Jared Allen I love him as a player but he hasn't topped 30 minutes yet in a game this season he's he's a decent price on FanDuel and DraftKings but I I don't I would be surprised if tonight's the night where they need him to play 30 minutes for the first time this year and then Mobley  I again it's just more about is he going to get the four full workload because this game gets out of hand I'm the Piston side though I mean Wiseman assuming Bagley sits out there's no more of an obvious play on this DF DFS late then James Wiseman not a big fan of what he can do on a basketball court or you know how much he can help a team win actual NBA games but he's producing on a permanent equipment when he's getting time over the past couple games he's averaging well over a fancy Point per minute and 14 minutes per in each of the two contests with with Duran out so if Bagley sits too you know why is men should be a lock for 28 to 32 minutes if not more and he's basically a minimum price player on both TFS platforms for tonight Alex what's Your Gut telling you about Yana's plan tonight or not playing I think this would be a very nice opportunity for Janice to take another breather against the Charlotte Hornets against the team that both Brandon Miller and Hayward may not play I don't know if he'll deal with the catfish  yeah dealing with the catfish you and they looked so good against Toronto that part of me thinks like they're like okay maybe we can give them another break here we'll see if we can keep it rollin with Lillard who was hot so you know gut feeling I won't be shocked if he doesn't play it's on the road too no pressure to play him at home or anything  that's that's my thought and for DFS purposes I mean if Janice does sit I think Lillard is a smashing on FanDuel I believe he's a little bit more affordable on FanDuel you know yeah I would bump up his fantasy projection by like 10 points 10 fantasy points with with Giannis out like it's substantial if you honest sits and then even for for the streaming spot start option who I they didn't start as who was the guy they started in place of Giannis pretty sure was Andrea Jackson Andre Jackson yes so that guy he exists he's in the NBA should we consider him for DFS if he gets another spot started out Alex um probably not you know he played 16 minutes did not score a point took one shot he's really out there like a lot of these bucks bench guys are like both champs for example the Bucks are very old the very slow they can get kind of lazy and transitioning and on defense Jackson is out there to just be just running out it just running around playing defense we're walking in transition so that's what he did against the Pistons he came in for a handful minutes and was just like pressuring the ball I was surprised to see him get the spot start for honest because he is basically like a 66 guard and he was guarding he was you know playing defense against the guards the Pistons game I went to so all right is there do you say closing thoughts Shannon on on tonight's late if you have them  sure yeah this DFS late I like I said why is Vince my my favorite play assuming Bagley sits one other guy who I can't get away from on FanDuel John Collins there's only 5300 tonight he's about a thousand dollars more expensive  on DraftKings but Walker Kessler's already been ruled out for tonight and over the past two games you know John Collins is performance been kind of up and down a little bit for Utah Jazz his minutes he before Kessler James Lee injury rarely top 30 minutes please play 38 and 32 minutes past two games so if he's getting 35 ish minutes tonight I love I love him at 5300 yeah and on the season he's almost a Fantasy Point per minute so that's kind of what you're looking for  all right Alex tell us about our good friends at rival fantasy  I would love to Lebron vs Jordan Magic versus bird Barkley

tonight Isaiah Moberly might not be bad I'm a little I'm like mildly intrigued by Isaiah Mobley Ken I assume you're old man rant will not be about Isaiah Mobley  ah Andrew Wiggins you  destroyed my second place RotoWire keeper League team last year with his 25 game end of season Family Matter absence and it's and he's destroying it again this year with terrible play for nine category League's Wiggins ranks 450 in per game value 450 he's getting paid 26 million per year last night the Warriors had Steph and Draymond out the Warriors needed Wiggins to shine what did he do he posted a pedestrian 12 points six boards Tuesday to assist know stocks and 0 from 4 from behind the arc they lost by 19 to OKC Wiggins you're 20 years old 28 years old that's too young to be washed up  and you're too old to run back and have Wiggins on your roster for a second year in a row you  was really cheap that is really low salary at our keeper like I couldn't resist I was like it's a personal matter he's healthy and he's been terrible he's been absolutely garbage  he has been bad as it's been clay  okay we had a I think we had actually a pretty dense mispronouncing names section in this podcast Shannon with Julian champagne which is in my head what I always call him yeah um and can unfortunately we had you say Batiste I think instead of potassium yeah I was I should just say Goga  yeah go go but you are also dealing with an illness I am sick you are playing through an illness okay everybody thank you Andrew Wiggins of RotoWire  thank you for joining us on the RotoWire fantasy

everybody and quote attention passengers this three car fantasy Trainwreck has hit the end of the line  struggling the sickness
