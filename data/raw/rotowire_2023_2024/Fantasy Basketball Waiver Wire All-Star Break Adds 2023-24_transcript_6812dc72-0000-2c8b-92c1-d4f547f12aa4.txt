hi welcome to the award-winning brought a wire fantasy basketball podcast it is Friday February 16th 2024 Alex peruva here which Shannon McEwen Ken is already in Cabo like the Bucs last night as they lost to the Grizzlies Doc Rivers said that by the way so we had some guys in Cabo  yeah Brian's asking where's Ken I think still in Vegas I think he moved there you know Vermont legalized Sports gambling he's just like I this is who I am now this is my personality  yeah but she gonna Shannon made the trip back from from Vegas and it's very good to do this podcast we're gonna keep it short today we are only going to talk news and then waiver wire and then we're out of here but if you have any questions drop them in and we'll try to get to him  first things first  Klay Thompson came off the bench last night and yesterday's win over the Jazz and we'll do so quote for the foreseeable future according to Steve Kerr of course he drops 35 points on 22 shots make 7 threes and 28 minutes and one and what ended up being a non overtime one 40 137 when in Utah the gemski got the start a Sharon do you expect this to change anything really in terms of fantasy value for the remainder of the season  I certainly on airpod side I do I think it solidifies his role as like a legit 10 team option for fantasy for Klay Thompson you were if you already rostered him this season it was primarily because of points and three pointers and I don't think that's going to change much even with his role Off the Bench he's currently averaging 17.3 points for game which is his lowest since his sophomore season but he still hit in three point three three-pointers there's not many players in the league that top out and and hit three over three three-pointers per game so he's going to have fancy Valley I think that holds even in the bench role you know as we saw last night he's going to get hot from downtown he was 7 for 13 from downtown 13th for 22 from the floor even chipped in six rebounds which was nice but in 28 minutes yep he played 30 minutes in backpack games before that  I don't I really don't think it'll change much I think we'll see clay 25 to 30 minutes score 14 to 16 points and give you you know close to 3.33 pointers per game so if he was giving you value as a starter it's gonna hold as a reserve  um we also have Danilo Gallinari go with the buck Shannon  very exciting Gallo has agreed to join the bucks for the rest of the season  yeah  I like them because it gives he gives the Bucks options besides Crowder Portis Patty C and the other end of the bench guys he'll help stretch the floor a little bit  he's awesome on his last legs this isn't the Gallinari that that we saw you know in his prime no where close to that nowhere close to Nick's or nuggets going already or even if it's Clippers gallon are he really he is definitely on you know the final season or two of his career most likely but he can't still hit a three-pointer helps stretch the floor you know helps you got Middleton who can never really stay healthy but from a fantasy standpoint I don't expect the aloe to play more than like 15 minutes for game yeah I think that's that's about right I mean I the Bucks look doc River Doc Rivers loves his veterans that's a big portion of this I think that Doc Rivers probably wants you know fewer minutes for guys like Beauchamp and AJ Green and who knows about the NASA's but Middleton's also been out like you said I would be shocked shocked if this results in anything meaningful in terms of fantasy value he is taking over the vacant Joe Ingles role yes Bucks team  absolutely um okay Shannon we have to talk about it Isaiah Stewart last night arrested for punching Drew Eubanks at the arena I will say drew Eubanks  kind of an underrated like you get some people's faces like you makes his pistol a lot of people off so not I I can understand why beef stew had enough given beef stews temper as well  possibly a small suspension coming we don't know a lot right now I'll give you the Florida to talk about whether you think maybe there's a suspension and just like what the Pistons post deadline rotation kind of what they're up to yeah I I mean  I don't know if it's going to be a small suspension I think there it's in play that he doesn't return to the court this season well we'll have to see what happens but he was arrested and issued a citation and then released by Arizona or Phoenix police so it's something to keep tabs on if I roster Isaiah Stewart in 10 or 12 teams I've I would have already have cut eight definitely doing it now he's already been out with an injury anyways so if you you know if you had an ill spot you probably might have had him stash there in a deeper format but I think he's safe to drive in all four mattes you know the Pistons are awesome playing around with rotations they have a bunch of new pieces to work in they might just sideline Isaiah Stewart for the remainder of the season right at least we can tell this gets all sorted out you've got Simone contact Yo there now he was inserted into the starting lineup a couple games ago and I think that's really  where you will see some some decent value from a fantasy standpoint fontech yo is roster in 30 of Yahoo leaks were not going to talk to him talk about Simone in the waiver way or section but I think he's worth the look in 12 team leads over the past three games averaging 15 points 2.3 3-pointers 4.7 rebounds in 26 minutes per and I expect those mints go up now that he started yeah well I'm interested to see what happens with Stuart but you're talking about dropping him I think it's fine just because he was kind of Fringe roster spot for most 12 teams anyway points in categories so yeah with the optionality the the Pistons have don't be surprised if he ends up being a droplet let's take a few questions before we jump into the waiver wire  Shannon actually am I gonna talk about this guy I don't think I am well we'll put this question would you rather have Aaron neesmith or Marvin Bagley 14 team 9 cat head-to-head tough tough call I think it's actually in a in a categorical League you know I'm picking whichever categories I need more help on so if it's scoring if it's scoring field goal percentage rebounds then Bagley gets the edge if it's if it's three point shooting maybe steals that's where I would rather go with Nesmith so that that's gonna dictate my decision there it's really which categories do I need more help on and I expect I do expect Bagley to be a solid overall player I like them a little bit more in points league and if it was straight points League I would say Begley gets the edge you know there is awesome some injury concerns of Bagley but we have back-to-back games where he's played 28.20 and 30 minutes now over 34 fantasy points and each of those games so I do give the The Edge to Bagley in general all categorical  needs are even Begley gets the edge but I would look at what your team needs are first  yep yeah the had to had nine cats important because really what you're trying to do is win five of your nine categories so you want to lean into your strongest categories but I answered sharing is basically exactly what I was going to say there there's a chance they're pretty neck and neck the rest of the year you just gotta pick whoever fits your your sort of Bill  J Sizzle 810 just dropped Klay Thompson for Trey man in a nine Cat 10 Team league  is this a good move I will say  I like it just from an upside perspective because I don't think clay really has top 100 I know many more  and I think Trey man I'm gonna talk about me a little bit I don't want to blow my cover and Trey man but I will say I think he will still play  significant minutes when the Bellow comes back  I I agree with that assessment and that's why I like that move yeah I think it's similar scenario where if you end up needing three-pointers more you could probably find someone else on the waiver wire but Traverse tree man has been contributing across the board the last few games and even after lamelo returns which you know is to be determined when but I think there's a role for Trey man on this team even then like I could see Cody Martin being moved to the bench Brandon Miller in my opinion is more of a small forward so you start ball and Trey man at the two guard spots Miller at the Three Bridges at the four Richards at the five and have Martin who is more of a complimentary player anyways coming off the bench so I like Trey man and his long-term upside for the major of the season yes let's take one more question before we jump into the waiver wire should I sell high on buddy hield or hold on to him for the rest of the season Christian asks I basically I wrote a kind of a winners and losers type post-trade deadline column and I just was like you gotta sell high and Buddy yield I look what heals doing right now is amazing his passing is reaching levels he's never done before and his career he's got six assists and four straight games he's falling out of control right now but  to buy his Harris missed the past two games Tyrese Maxey missed one of those games and DeAnthony Melton has remained out but tomb has been out this entire time so  yes I would sell high but I would say as I said My article I would only sell high if you could get like a guaranteed  top 60 player in return okay I I can agree I was gonna say top 50 if you're getting a top 50 player in return I think it's a solid move buddy hield been a top 50 player over the past couple weeks and certainly since he joined the 76ers I mean he's he is averaging since starting moving and starting lineup for the Sixers see averaging 22 points four rebounds seven and a half assists 1.8 steals the assist will definitely not hold we know that but also 4.53 pointers 45% from downtown yeah I would say he is a guy who could shoot for 40% or higher from downtown he shot 42 and a half percent from three last year and with this team the difference with the Sixers as opposed to the Pacers is the volume I think is likely to be there I do not Envision Nic Batum challenging buddy hield for minutes it obviously helps that you had Maxi or Harris missed time in some of those games but if you're I value buddy  heal as a top 75 fantasy player for their major of the season so unless you're getting top 60 top 50 in return I think you hold him and I yes the Minotaur or another thing too I will say 39 minute average over these past four games I don't think that's gonna continue but healed has ranked inside the top 50 before in his career he's been a top 75 player multiple times and he's only needed about 30 minutes to do so so I think I think he's been a top 80 player almost every season in his career even when coming off the bench so yeah I I do like them quite a base not gonna do what he's been done for the past four games but I firmly believe he's a top 60 top 50 ish player for the remainder of the season  all right before we jump into the waiver wire don't forget Roto while you're calm slash pod  go get that link you can get a free look behind our paywall we have a ton tons of content back there for you guys and do not forget to like And subscribe like this video And subscribe to the RotoWire NBA YouTube channel if you like this content okay let's jump into the waiver wire  Shannon and I are going to give you about four each to make up for Ken's absence but I will mention for games next week a different leagues different standard formats across different host sites have different rules for the All-Star break some sites have this as a two-week block some sites have this as a as a one week block I'm gonna be talking like this is a two-week block and that you're gonna set your lineup again when play resumes so if that's the case about for your league about half the teams have three games about half have two and two teams only have one game for next week after the All-Star Breakers that is Memphis in Miami so keep that in mind when setting your lineups when picking guys up when dropping guys at cetera  but I will start off with the guy we mentioned earlier in the show Trey man of the Charlotte Hornets he has 34% rostered his first three games with a Hornets he's averaging about 14 points on 46% from the field and 46% from deep that also includes seven rebounds seven assists in just over a steal  it seems like lamelo is going to come back after the All-Star break we don't know Charlotte is incredibly dodgy with their injury injury reporting and they're updating  but even so even if lamelo comes back right after the All-Star break I think Charlotte's going to prioritize man in the rotation now I have a lamelo but just in general I think you'll operate probably as a six-man or potentially even start like shagging mentioned over like Cody Martin  they could probably get minutes in the high 20s given what he's shown as a pastor that's probably going to be enough for him and they got other guys they can kick out of the rotation I mean I'm not I mean physically metrich has been playing 20 minutes is that really gonna continue are they gonna keep are they gonna keep giving 20 minutes to Seth Curry 12 minutes per tons like there's room for all for lamelo and Trey man to play  absolutely yeah hinted at that during the new section I totally agree with that I should be rostered in probably 60 70 week so very easily I think he's a 10 Team league option so I support that pic  I will oh I don't think what hornets have three games by the way so even if you're worried you pick him up you got three games for installation if he comes off the bench and he's only playing 20 minutes or something but yes go ahead Janet  my first waiver wire suggestion as airpods himself Brandon podemski he's back in the starting lineup as he's been moving in and out of the starting lineup for the Warriors all season but as we alluded to during the the news section Klay Thompson is now being deployed in a reserve role for the foreseeable future and I just love what what airpods has been able to provide he's been very solid for the Warriors all year as a starter he's seen a nice increase in production 14 starts this year he's averaged 3 1. 6 1 1  is rostered in let's see  47% of Yahoo rosters that should certainly be higher so I I think he needs to be rostered in most 10 year if probably all 10 team leads goop them up he projects He has proved to all year he doesn't have too many weaknesses besides like he doesn't really get to the free-throw line and his efficiency can kind of be up and down that's a really about it for him that you're worried about so I really like that before I get to mine we have a question in the chat from Manila Most Wanted do we need to start selling marketing Now jazz gave up on the run with the trades they did yeah I mean I don't mind the sell high on marketing if you're a specialty worried about it um I I'm you know I don't think they're going to be as heavy pulling the plug as maybe they were last year I mean they're still fighting for Golden State with a play in spot I know like you said and I agree with you the moves they made tell you that they are fine not making the play and they're fine not making the playoffs I agree but they're so far out of the bottom five like they have 26 wins the bottom five is Charlotte at 13 Washington at 9 Detroit today Portland at 15 San Antonio at 11 they can't really far like fall like that much farther down so to me it's not as much of a cell as Jaron Jackson that's hella phrase that I totally agree with that statement I I don't think he's a cell I think they pretty pretty obviously were gonna we're gonna try to play both sides of it they're like we're gonna sell off some pieces and make room for create more minutes for our first round picks in keyonte George Walker Kessler those two guys are both starting now for them they also have Hendricks coming off the bench and getting wrote  game which wasn't the case before the trades I think they they said we could still compete still be competitive maybe push for a play in while also freeing up minutes for for our young guys I I don't think they're going to just shelf Market unless he unless they continue drop they have lost four in a row you know if you suffer some kind of injury that's going to force their hand but right now like we saw last night they're out there trying to beat the the Warriors and really move up in the standings and compete for that plan so I don't think Martin is an obvious sell at the stage  my next waiver wire suggestion speaking of the Jazz keyonte George who is 27% rostered on February 12th he was named the starter going forward yes he started three straight games but he seen at least 25 minutes and six straight so this was coming for a little while in this in this six game stretch he's ever been averaging 16 points on 46% from the field 47% from Deep let's go get the client a little bit but five assists 3.3 rebounds 1.2 steals he was having huge efficiency issues at the beginning of the Season as we all know as people in category leaks were like wringing their hands do I keep them do I drop them he's taking my field goal percentage  but since the summer  he's 42% from the field and 37% from Deep so now we he's in the competence Zone it's wild to me that he is not more heavily rostered it's a guy he's 27% rostered he is a top 50 or top 60 player over the past week averaging 34 minutes per game and those three games  he is you know this this one of the rookies that everyone was high on stashing at the beginning of the year and it's been it's been up and down you know he's had his struggles but he's locked in the starting lineup now for the remainder of the season and he should absolutely be your roster at a higher percentage than that  ooh here's a good question related to that would you keep keonte or SKU Anderson for rest of season  that that's interesting because last night the news came down last night that Henderson will start for the remainder of the season for Portland  I know which way I'm going but I want you to win on it for that  I think  that I would rather roster ah okay I would much rather roster scoot in a points league and a category League it is closer because scoots we talked about keyonte George having field goal per second issues scoot Henderson also has field goal percentage issues but he's been better lately I will say I'll lean scoot I will I'll do it yeah I think I think that assessment is pretty spot on a SKU is the better play for points basic leagues I am going to give him the edge in categorical as well primarily just because of his tremendous upside and we've seen him go out there and score 30 points multiple times in the past month or two he has that solid you know he has more upside to go out there and score 25 points and drop 10 dine then George does I like both players a ton and I am trying to roster both if I can't  who is your second waiver wire suggestion and Ayo to Sumo for the Chicago Bulls the guy we talked about a lot this season he is 44% rostered on Yahoo top 50 player over the past week with averages of 20 points and 4.73 pointers and 37 minutes for game in in the past three games you know friendly reminder know Zach LaVine for the remainder of the Season you have Caruso has been a has been questionable basically every game for I don't know the past month or two the Sumo should continue to see tons of Run for the Chicago Bulls any you know as as Alex and Ken and I have all talked about he's shown growth on the offense and he's been more aggressive yeah even the he just scored a career high 29 points against a lana he took 18 field goal attempt that game I expect you know there could be scenarios like with the Minnesota game a week ago where  Chicago goes with a twin towers set up to pay on matchup but other than that one game just two most started eight of nine so I expect I fully expect he will be locked in the starting lineup or starting 90% of the games here on out and playing 30 plus minutes I think he's worth a look 12 teams no doubt some 10 teams he's going to be an option as well yep double digit scoring in 14 of his past 15 games solid on defense too so if you need a little bit of Defense not a bad option I'm gonna I'm gonna pivot off of my third pick to go straight to my fourth pick because we have a question related to my fourth player old yeast says great show thanks ESPN points League I gotta choose between Olynyk and Derek Lively I'm conflicted let me talk about all the Nick first because he is one of my waiver wire suggestions so I'll do the rundown here he's 35% rostered got traded from Utah Toronto  he exited the most recent game for Toronto Google back straight so throw that one at the window seven minutes played  before that he played 43 total minutes in two games  28 points 11 rebounds five six and six steals with a block total in those 43 minutes  look it's kind of a weird trade the guy in the trade too we were kind of unsure about what they were going to do with all the Nick and terms of like how much they gonna play him I think they like him out there as a floor space in look at the five around Scottie Barnes um and that isn't a floor space at 5 that isn't Chris Boucher and it's working so far all and it can Barnes who played 31 minutes together bards 10 assists to two turnovers in that time  the question on whether you roster him versus Derek Lively  I think that if all things were equal like if both of these guys were playing 30 minutes  I would rather have Ole in it but  I don't have much faith in all the Nick playing more than about 20 a game  and Lively also confusing I'll ask you shagging this Lively Gafford split  Lively just came back from a broken nose played 17 minutes off the bench I think he's gonna start but I also don't think it's gonna matter that much in terms of minutes split how do you kind of evaluate that situation  I I view Gafford as the most likely option to start for this team I think it's telling that they went with Gafford in Lively's return they also went with PJ Washington at the power forward spot I I just I think yeah for this teams trying to win they want to make push I think gaffer's gonna give them the better option to do so so I you know it's gonna be a pretty close platoon it's you know it could be 24 18 something along those lines  I just I worry about Lively I still like Lively long-term obviously and Dynasty keeper leagues I think he's got tons of upside but this year I do like a further the remainder of the season over Lively and with Olynyk  my concern with olenek is the fact that those two games that those two solid games that he had for Toronto 22 and 21 minutes great production they lost both those games by a lot by a lot by 24 and 23 points  I want to see how the clinic is actually going to be when they have a competitive game and how much runny he's going to get I cautious I'll side with a winick here but I do believe it's toss up and my actual preference is to find a third option that both of them  I think that's fair you know Raptors are 19 and 36  I actually wrote about this in my article because I don't know what they're doing their pick this season actually hold on  um I don't know I lost it whatever I was looking at I lost it but yeah I just I don't know man I don't know what they're doing  okay let's go to  who's who it's up to you Shannon it's up to you  all right my next waiver wire suggestion I'm actually we'll do a little two-for-one here you know Ken had the gaggle of Grizzlies last week we're just gonna trim that down to a Duo Zaire Williams who is officially my long shot of the week guard for Memphis one percent Ross rostered so he's available everywhere you can go get him he's coming off a career game scored a career high 27 points in 36 minutes also had four rebounds four assists three steals he was four for seven from downtown which is nice to see because he hasn't been the greatest shooting from downtown he hasn't been shy about it he is hitting 1.23 pointers per game this year but but only 32% I've always got a crush Isaiah Williams thought he could do more it was nice to see last night in that game against that that massive upset win against the box which is hilarious but Zaire WIlliams 40 almost 45 fantasy points for DFS he's had he's flirted with that before he had 32 fantasy points a couple weeks ago against Orlando this team is so short-handed and it's gonna be a revolving door of players that I do think that you're Williams is worth a streaming options in the short term the other option from Memphis that I like a lot is the young man GG Jackson he had another big game 30 minutes 27 points not much outside of scoring one rebound 060 steals one block but he was 10 for 17 from the floor six for 10 from downtown good for 28 fantasy points in that win over the box he hasn't started he's only made one start so far this season so he's coming off the bench seeing seeing a decent role Off the Bench for Memphis I mean he's played 20 or more minutes in six straight games he has dnp in there as well where he's essentially arrested I still like Gigi I do think they might uncork him towards the the final stretch of the season and he's out there playing 35 minutes per so GG not as heavily or not as as heavily available as I or Williams he is rostered in 34% of leaks he's a guy if you need three-pointers scoring GG Jackson's an option efficiency will be an issue though so he is a risk on that end in categorical leaks  yeah I mean this this grisly situation  it's almost we don't know what's going to happen here with all the injuries all the guys setting out Etc we don't even know I mean they're talking like Desmond Bane's Gonna Come Back  I don't even believe that I mean they're saying like it's going to happen  that would be insane to me um so yeah I it's hard for me to say that Jackson Williams basically anybody who's on the Grizzlies who's seen decent magnets lately is not a fine pickup just to have on your bench or is optionality as an upside play just because it's they I think we still have we still have three April and this team is already looking like this so it's gonna be I think it's gonna be a mess for a lot of the season I will say I found what I was looking for with this with this Raptors thing  the Raptors  owe their pick to San Antonio if it falls between if it falls outside of six  they gave Santonio a protected one to six first round pick in the jakub pearl trade yeah deranged move right now the the Raptors are in sixth  but they are three and a half games behind Portland in terms of like bad record  so and give well given the quality of teams that Kelly Linux played on the last few years you know Detroit the Rockets now the Raptors it's possible the key to saving that pick and keeping it is just playing a Linux for minutes  yeah very very weird situation if I was a Raptors fan I buy the I would be  I would be beside myself let's say that all right my final Waiver Wires suggestion  Corey kispert of the Washington Wizards 15% rostered  as clearly been given the green light practically irradiated Greenlight past eight games for kids 17 points with three threes a 50% for the field 35% from three three point nine rebounds two and a half assists in 28 minutes Wizards have three games next week so extreme amid absolutely I have hot take for you I think he's Washington's second most talented scorer  behind Kyle kuzma  Pittsburgh has been under utilized for so long he does not deserve to be on a bad team like Washington and he is not just a three-point shooter I think that's something I need to emphasize he's not like a pure 3-point streamer he shoots a lot of twos actually like half only half of a shots are threes which is kind of a lot kind of not depending on what you think about he's a great cutter  decent Pastor such an obvious streaming candidate with three weeks in the green light he's been giving  nice I will push back on the second most talented scorer because I'll tell you who I think the first most talented scorer is on that team  it's our boy Danny oh yeah I mean coming off a career high 43 points he gets the line got to like 13 times in that game if he starts getting the line more yeah and having more of a a green light from downtown 6 for 10 I think that might be the first game yeah definitely the first game this season he's taking double digit 3-point attempts I I'm just in love with obvious the his total package as an NBA player big fan so we'll just count this as shout out he is averaging 28 points 11 and a half rebounds 3.88 and 2.83 pointers over the past four games 39 minutes per in those four games and I'm the fool who traded him in our keeper league but  I know I love audio as well both of these guys deserve to be like on winning rosters it's just you know yeah awesome since I packaged the two Grizzlies together I do have one more pick for us and we are going with another name that has been discussed on this segment this year Andrew nembhard starting shooting guard for the Indiana Pacers he has started six straight games over and since the trade deadline his Productions picked up some in those four contests he's at Gene 31 minutes 10 points 4.8 assists and 1.5 Steals and it's really the assist that I just wanted to point out the four point eight assists is tough to find on the waiver wire specially this time of year so if you're in need of assist and looking for a sneaky option he's a guy who could provide that his upside for more I mean even on the season he's averaging 4.6 assists in 23 minutes per you know if his minutes continue to have her in that 30 range then I expect him to actually be averaging over  five assists in short order  yeah and Rick Carlisle we all want to happen like we all want been math and 30 minutes he's putting up 20 points six magnet a year I think Carlisle just does not like him so Neymar I think it's gonna continue getting the minutes let's close out the show we're not doing we're not doing All-Star break anything you know not doing all staring anything there we got a few questions in the chat I want to close out with let's do and and no sadly I know any of you have been listening for years typically I do an NHL DFS slate preview on this All-Star break Friday sadly I am ill equipped I mean I've always been ill equipped but I'm Ill prepared to do it this year so we're gonna pass on that segment quickly Ryan says Jordan Goodwin looked good last night for Memphis risky but has potential good one was good last year with Washington like if you've been playing you played Fantasy last year and he just streamer when I think it was Beal who was out yeah he looked good last year so that's something to keep in mind  uh treating her pronouncing your name correctly wants to drop IO or potentially drop IO soon move for Grant Williams Ammon Thompson bully on bogdanovich genre or Trey mad personally I think I would just keep IO soon though here I think I like him as much as any of those options I know Grant Williams has looked really good the last three games coming off the bench for Charlotte but I'm firmly not a Believer he had plenty of opportunity in Dallas and could have had a similar 30 minute per game role He's Just Not That guy so he's doing great again I'll give him credit where credit is to 17.7 rebounds and five he's hitting two three-pointers on 5.7 3-point attempts per game right now for Charlotte I I think he's gonna revert back to the guy we've seen the past couple years with Boston and Dallas and you know that eight to nine points with with four four rebounds and and one and a half to two three-pointers  so I'm not very high on Grant Williams amen  he is he deserves all the praise is all the praise and worship but van Fleet will return soon enough I still think amen my stick in that lineup because of the upside he's shown the the yeah the the what they've already invested in him with such a high pick they're going to want him to be a starter boy on I I think he's got limited upside especially once the next healthy Schroeder similar situation man I do like quite a bit but AO I probably I'd probably try rank AO like second or third in that group so I'm holding him and or I'm sorry I would rank him first right now but Trey man and amen close second and third  um yeah I'm with you on that training also wants to know he says Hey words Gordon hayward's on his waiver wire to this is a points League that could end up you know working out but I just would keep IO and because you don't know what Gorgon hey where he's always heard we don't know always rolls gonna be I wasn't preemptively drop the soon move for Heyward and then he wants to know are we scared of Pat Williams coming back  and taking to soon movies  not really um partially because I think that might put an end to like the drum and experimentation at power forward so there's minutes there and then I think Tori Craig and potentially Jevon Carter and like Dale and Terry who's also playing minutes they just they just lose minutes and I think to Sumo Keith's playing what he's playing yeah I think Chicago has been pretty competitive with the roster 5 and 5 over the past 10 they're playing you know they are competing for a plan they're currently 9th in the East and that pretty much it would be a surprise at this point you know if they drop out of the play in because they do have a four and a half game cushion over the Nets who are in the 11th seed I think they probably stick with their current starting lineup to see who could see some Ministry drop a slight drop in minutes but I am not too concerned I do want to go back to Gordon Hayward though I actually just dropped Gordon Hayward for Trey man in the league so there's a copyright there you know if you're I'm fine if one of these guys who've been highlighted if if  AIO if Trey man some of the top waiver wire adds that we've been suggesting the past few weeks if they're available I think that hey we're safe to drop I want drop them for Zaire Williams though not our long shots but some of the top pickups I do think hayward's worth dropping final question  who did drop for Trey man Dilo Conley or Schroeder to be this is Schroeder  and I don't know if it's that close I suppose you could make an argument Schroeder versus Conley  you know what Schroeder keeps starting and playing 30 minutes yeah that's closed or I'll say here is Do not drop D'Angelo Russell for for  Trey mad right now the other two I could see a big of an argument for  yeah I think I'm dropping I'm dropping Schroeder for him I do think intruder  it's interesting to see what he's gonna do with the Nets he looked good and his first game Off the Bench 15 and 12 and he's put together two Duds since then even and tough matchup against Boston in both of those games but you know even as a starter he ended up only playing 18 minutes they were absolutely blown out lost by 50 points to the Boston Celtics  I still like Schroeder and deeper formats but give me Trey man over him he had the Nets you know they have long he Walker or they have been Simmons they have Dennis Smith these are guys I think they're a little interesting in developing and Dennis Schroder is 30 that's also something to keep in mind and then that's our not that good  that will do it for us thank you everybody for being here despite cannot being here thank you for the questions and we're just we're just gonna wrap this thing up I hope everybody has a good All-Star break you can relax a little bit hope the festivities are fun and we will catch you guys next week
