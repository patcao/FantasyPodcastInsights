            "Steve Alexander, doctor a. It is Tuesday, February 20th. This is the award winning RotoWire Fantasy Basketball podcast.\n",
            "\n",
            "That is Brian Rosenworcel from the Manchester. We're gonna talk some all star. We're gonna talk some nets since he's a nets expert.\n",
            "\n",
            "We're gonna look at some maybe hot free agents since we're in the middle of this long break and take some of your questions. So let's do this. Brian, what's happening? Not much.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's an honor to be on this award winning podcast. What are you eating? Pistachios that have been in my car for how no who knows how long. And why are you in your car? Because my kids are so loud in the house.\n",
            "\n",
            "K. Alright. Those are all very good answers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Your hair is looking particularly tall today. I think the skylight is accentuating its height. Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "Well, I I'm I'm I had a dream about this podcast, early this morning, and I I was walking down the stairs backstage at a venue that Guster was playing at, and there was a man standing at the bottom of the stairs with really long, dark black hair. And it was like, it was cut really it was it was Jimmy Butler's haircut. You know, his emo cut that he did at the beginning of the season.\n",
            "\n",
            "And when I got when when the guy turned around, it was you, and you had Jimmy Butler's emo hair. And then I woke up. It was awesome.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yeah. That's that's a great dream. I I Jimmy Butler's hair from early in the year was a revelation, and we people should have been talking more about it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Really? And then the fact that it is in his bio picture now, like, when you look up Jimmy Butler, the that's the hair you get. That is the hair that was on your head, when I when I awoke from the street. Anything's possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alright. So, apparently, you did not watch the all star game. Is that correct? I kinda check out of the all star festivities in general.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's it's feels very separate from my love of the NBA. Does that make any sense? It makes a ton of sense. I I looked at the box score on my phone and saw that Luca wasn't doing anything, and I saw that Dame was kinda going off for the east, and I was like, there's I'm not turning that on.\n",
            "\n",
            "I never even I never even turned it on for one second. My son was downstairs watching it. But I just I and I tweeted, you know, I tweeted on Wednesday or Thursday.\n",
            "\n",
            "Like, I don't know why people get so excited about the all star game because every single year, as soon as it's over, everybody's like, well, that was a travesty. I wish I would have never watched. And that's exactly what happened again this year, like, 200 and a 180 or whatever.\n",
            "\n",
            "Like, I don't know, man. I and I don't know how to fix it. I don't know that it'll ever be fixed.\n",
            "\n",
            "I don't think these guys, you know, they're on it's their spring break, and they don't really feel like playing defense. And there's no there's no competitive reason for them to try really hard in the all star game. The only thing that the only thing that's gonna make them try is if they have personal competitive pride, which they may have personal competitive pride and still not try in the all star game.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I don't I don't know what the answer is, but, I mean, basically, unwatchable. You know what? They incentivized the in season tournament by offering them financial rewards, which is bizarre for us to, like, see these guys competing, in the middle of a NBA season for extra cash. That seems odd to me.\n",
            "\n",
            "If they do that for the all star game, it's gonna be even worse. The worst part for me as a fan is just how long the all star break has become. Like, it's over a week, right, of that we're off.\n",
            "\n",
            "And for those of us who feel giant empty voids of sadness in our life when fantasy basketball goes away, it can be a hard time of year. Very, very difficult struggle to get through the week without without actual real basketball. But, you know, as, you know, Malcolm is in first, you're in second.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm in 3rd in our in our main league. Like, like, I'm ready to get going again. This is a big week for me.\n",
            "\n",
            "I need to win. I need that. I need to have you not do so well.\n",
            "\n",
            "And and the other thing about the All Star break is what it does is it condenses 2 weeks into 1 long week and you only get your 4 moves, so you gotta really be careful with those, and all that all that stuff. Did you watch or here here's what here's the best idea I've heard so far. Scrap the whole thing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Just keep playing. Do a do an in season tournament for 2 or 3 weeks around the all star break and have it regionalized so, like, you put teams in certain cities and they just they have many tournaments and then they all meet in Vegas or India or wherever and play the finals, and then have the dunk contest and the three point contest during that weekend of the finals for the actual in season tournament that people care about. What do you think about that? Sounds terrible.\n",
            "\n",
            "I just don't want any of it. I don't like the in season tournaments. The one thing I did like was seeing that Charles Barkley race against was it an old official? Yeah.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fell down and kissed on the lips. I thought that was funny. They should just do that.\n",
            "\n",
            "Just just have potato sack races with Charles Barkley. I'll tune into that. Take 2 weeks off.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'll do that. That's awesome, dude. Because when I tweeted out that you and I were doing the show today together, somebody on Twitter was like, oh, queue up the 2018 references for these for these 2 old guys that are coming on to talk all star game or something.\n",
            "\n",
            "I don't know what he said, but it's funny that you went back, like, 25 years straight for the Barkley kissing the referee. And it was a old it was old dude. I can't think of his I can't think of his name.\n",
            "\n",
            "Oh, it's too bad. I just think Charles Barkley is a great ambassador for the sport. I love him.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm not a huge fan of, like, Kendrick Perkins when he when they put him on the TV. Is is am I veering this podcast into a direction I shouldn't? No. I think you're okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "I love Barkley. I think you're fine. I don't think either one of those dudes are are paid by rotor wire.\n",
            "\n",
            "I I think you're I think you're good. Yeah. I love Barkley too.\n",
            "\n",
            "And Barkley Barkley is not a fan of this all star game thing. He he didn't like what's going on. But alright.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's talk about your Brooklyn Nets because as I understand it, Brian, you live within walking distance of going to see the Nets play basketball. Is that correct? And you can get cheap seats these days. How often do you go? You know, I go a few times a year.\n",
            "\n",
            "My kids will go, and we caught an overtime game earlier in the year, which is fun. So they mainly, they just wanna get the 4th quarter McDonald's promotion where you get free fries if the other team misses 2 free throws in a row. That's all they care about.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm like, I'll buy you fries for $3 and just we came and watched basketball. But, yeah, I can walk to Barclays, and it's it's great. I just wish the team felt a little bit more exciting right now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Well, I mean, I I guess it does. Right? Because Jacques Vaughn got fired yesterday. We're bringing in we're bringing in Kevin Ollie.\n",
            "\n",
            "Right? A former Yukon guy. Yeah. And we and the team is still intact.\n",
            "\n",
            "Your best player is Malik Beasley. Right? Mikal Mikal Bridges. Mikhail who is Malik Beasley? I told you.\n",
            "\n",
            "I didn't write anything down. When I don't write anything down, this is what happens. And I we haven't had NBA on TV in 5 days.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is what happens. Mikhail Bridges. And it's just the senior moments are to be expected when you are a part of our generation, Steve.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, I'll say this. Nicholas Claxton is real exciting to watch, but the key to this team, Ben Simmons. Yeah.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's a hard thing to say. If he would just play, he could be fantasy relevant on a team that's punting free throw percentage. He could he could put up 9 points, 9 rebounds, 9 assists every night.\n",
            "\n",
            "Like Who doesn't want that? Like a Draymond Green triple single. I don't know what the plan is here. They got rid of Dinwiddie.\n",
            "\n",
            "I I I don't really know the way forward, and I'll be honest. I've just kind of moved over to being a Knicks fan, which is really actually exciting. Well, I'm kind of excited about the Nets because McHale Bridges, even though I don't know his name and think he's Malik Beasley, who I don't even really know who that is.\n",
            "\n",
            "I think I was a get a player from the eighties or nineties, maybe. I don't know. Miguel Bridges is still a really good player.\n",
            "\n",
            "Is should he be an alpha dog? Should he be a number 1 on NBA team? Probably not, but that's that's where we are. With Dinwiddie out of the way, Cam Thomas and Dennis Smith junior, I I don't know. I I I feel like they could go on and run.\n",
            "\n",
            "I feel like they're gonna like playing for Kevin Ollie. I feel like this is gonna help Cam Thomas. You know what else is incredible about the nets, Brian? Please help me.\n",
            "\n",
            "And They play 4 times next week. Right? And then the week after that, they play 5 times. They have a 5 game week.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is time to pick up Ben Simmons. It's time to pick up any net you can get your hands on because that 5 that 5 game week is gonna be killer. And, there's a lot of there's a lot of nets that are gonna be gonna be playing a lot of minutes that we can.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cam Thomas is one of them, and I've got him on my 30 team league. I'm fired up about that. Nick Claxton is gonna be really good that week.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cam Johnson is gonna be really good that week if they play all 5. You know? That's Sierra thing. That's the flip side of the 5 game week is will guys even play 5 games anymore, in a 5 game week? I I Cam Thomas is, is gonna score a lot of points.\n",
            "\n",
            "He's not gonna play a lot of defense. Dennis Smith junior can still play. He can still throw down a a dunk, like, make himself look like John Morant.\n",
            "\n",
            "He is an exciting player. He's I don't think very fantasy relevant. So, yeah, you can you can go dabble in some nets, in your league, but you're gonna you're gonna want Ben Simmons on your team for the next couple weeks.\n",
            "\n",
            "It just makes me it makes me uncomfortable. It should. So this week that we're currently in, the second half of a long week at Yahoo and ESPN leagues, there are some one game weeks out there.\n",
            "\n",
            "Memphis and Miami only play one game this entire week. That is happening on Friday night. So Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, Vince Williams, Jaren Jackson, one game Friday night.\n",
            "\n",
            "That's it. The 3 game teams this week are weird because there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. There's, like, 12, 14 of them, but they all play Thursday, Friday, and Sunday except for 1.\n",
            "\n",
            "And the problem with playing on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday is there's at least 10 games on all three of those days. So even if you pick these guys up, you may not be able to plug them into your lineup because there's so many games that day. Now the day there's not any games is Saturday.\n",
            "\n",
            "Go ahead, Brian. What you're talking about is the advanced NBA hashtag grid here. It's the the number one tool for me.\n",
            "\n",
            "Am I allowed to promote them here on in on Rotowire? When I consult that thing, it always comes up with the exact week we're on, list the teams, the games, played that week, and it has a chart of who's playing Thursday, who's playing Saturday. So if you wanna stream players and maximize games played, which, you know, is a smart way to do it in a in a NBA fantasy league like the ones we play in, I go there. I make the move.\n",
            "\n",
            "I get a Thursday, Saturday guy in exchange for my Friday, Sunday guys that would just be on the bench anyway. Yeah. And RotoWire has that tool in their June.\n",
            "\n",
            "In their in their what what's the in their, itinerary? In their No. Itinerary is not word you want. No.\n",
            "\n",
            "That's that's like when you're scheduling to go to the airport and do your trip. It's in there. It'll come to me.\n",
            "\n",
            "Getting old sucks, Brian. Did you know that? I know, man. Look at people, I'm like, I used to know your name.\n",
            "\n",
            "How about in their repertoire? Isn't there Yeah. There you go. A little bit of Francaise for a little French in there.\n",
            "\n",
            "Throw a little French in there. But okay. So back to this 3 game week thing.\n",
            "\n",
            "So the Orlando Magic, if you're looking for a team that has an alternate schedule to what everybody else has, it is the Orlando Magic. So they're Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, and there's I think there's only 3 games on Saturday. So that's the day you're gonna need a player.\n",
            "\n",
            "If You're gonna make a 33 man a 3 game player move. I think, Orlando is the way to go, and you can probably find one of their many point guards available on your waiver wire along with maybe some some fringe guys that might be worth using, but it's not ideal. It's not a great it's not a great week to be scraping the waiver wire.\n",
            "\n",
            "And then the the teams that have, the good schedules coming up, I mentioned the nets. They go 4 and then 5. Cavaliers, Grizzlies, Heat, Timberwolves play 4 games each in each of the next 2 weeks starting next Monday.\n",
            "\n",
            "So Cavs, Grizzlies, Heat, Timberwolves, back to back 4 gamers. And then you can go to any schedule grid and look at it, but there's there's a lot of teams that finish up with, you know, there's teams that still have 5 out of 5 out of the final 7 weeks left. They'll have 4 games, per week.\n",
            "\n",
            "So You know, in these in these final weeks where it turns into the silly season, closing out your your fantasy win is often about managing your injured reserve, and also, you know, avoiding the guys that are gonna get rested. So the guys on my list are guys on on crappy teams. I'm looking at, like, guys like Thais Jones and, Jeremy Sochan, and, I don't say anyone's name correctly because I just read the names.\n",
            "\n",
            "And, you know, I I think the guys that got traded recently, like Daniel Gafford, could be really exciting. He's probably already on a lot of rosters, but I think he's gonna get enough minutes in Dallas to, like, be really effective, put up a lot of blocks, a lot of rebounds. So some, Alex Caruso, these guys on, like, crappy teams could really, like, shine in the last couple months.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yeah. I I think silly season is a real thing. I think we're there for a lot of these teams.\n",
            "\n",
            "I know that, Pozemski Brandon Pozemski just got picked up in one of my Yahoo Leagues. So if he's sitting there, I think you automatically have to have him on your team. A guy like Kelly Oubre could be sitting there on the waiver wire.\n",
            "\n",
            "I think he's worth a look. Any of the guys in Memphis go ahead. I wanna hear about your grizzlies, but I was gonna ask about, Podgenski.\n",
            "\n",
            "Is he a better pick than Kuminga? Kuminga seems to just put up points and a few boards and assists, but doesn't really get defensive stats. It depends. I mean, both of them are must have fantasy players right now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Like Really? Draymond Green just said he wouldn't trade Kuminga for LeBron James in real life right now, and Pojempski is taking over for Klay Thompson, taking over the world. I mean, you want both of those guys on any roster you can get them on. I think most nights, Pozemski is a little bit better of a fantasy player.\n",
            "\n",
            "My understanding of this golden state thing, Curry reached out to slap, Klay 5. Klay totally dissed him. The next day, Klay was benched, and came off the bench and and scored a zillion points.\n",
            "\n",
            "I know the second half of that is true. I didn't hear the part about Klay not responding to Steph Curry's dad. It was, it was, straight up, like, I'm pretending I don't see that you're reaching out to for a a high five here.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was, I think in the wake of, Curry saying he was okay for them to trade Clay. Was that a a story? I just read what I don't know. I Tommy Beer, Claire De Lune, I just read whatever they say.\n",
            "\n",
            "I just know that Klay has been struggling, and then the other day he was finally like, I felt okay. And then he got benched after another Podrzybski big game, and then he went off off the bench. But all is not well in Golden State, clearly.\n",
            "\n",
            "Things are not things are not great, but, Gigi Jackson in Memphis, Vince Williams in Memphis, those are guys you want on your team. And these are all guy I'm just reading right off my roster, Brian, from our league at this point. Denny Abdi Abdiya, Abdiya playing really well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Actually, did you see what he did last week? No. I'd I'd like to know. Unfortunately, I can't reference it because I'm in my car avoiding my children.\n",
            "\n",
