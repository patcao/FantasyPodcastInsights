       "\"State Warriors. But let's start with the LA Lakers. You know, there's a a big outbreak of panic on fantasy basketball Twitter after this game when Darvin Ham said, yeah. You know, we we've kinda want to to to have this plan in place for LeBron James to to have a limited workload during the regular season. He played 29 minutes last night, was notably, like, in and out of the game in in short stints. You know, didn't play a ton, in the first half, especially. And even as the lakers were making a rally, you know, it felt like they were pretty hard line sticking to this stance that LeBron James was not going to play 30 minutes no matter what. Still gives you 21, 8, and 5 with a steal, 10 of 16 from the field. I thought he looked great physically. I will say this. I I don't think LeBron James is going to average under 30 minutes this season. This is like the 8th year in a row that whatever team he's on has said that they're managing his workload.

We're not gonna go game by game or anything here since we got 12 games, but, you know, talk about some of these these, you know, situations that you're looking at, when you're looking for, you know, kind of pairing down a slate like this to find games or props to target. So for and this isn't I have I have 5 typical situational spots that I look for, and and none of it is, you know, that I follow like it's the bible in terms of, everything is is case by case. But there are 5 situations that I target throughout the course of the season that that have been pretty profitable for me. In terms of night 1, none of them apply because a lot of these deal with the ebbs and flows of an NBA season. For tonight, I think it's pretty basic. If you if you think there's an edge for a home team, take them. Take them against the spread. Home teams in their season opening game where the energy is never gonna be higher, legs are\",\n",

It was talk about it on the live stream, which I just talked for 90 minutes straight kinda to myself. Like, there are some people leaving comments, but it was overwhelmingly just me, you know, just saying whatever I want. That's the dream. You know, something I I hadn't really thought about, you don't really hear about with marketing is, like, alright. We have one sample of him being, you know, one of the 25 to 30 best Fantasy players in the league, and we have 5 years of him just being, like, a pretty average player. Is is it fair to assume that the guy he was last year is just who he's going to be going forward? For the sake of my team, I hope the answer is yes, but I I wanna get your opinion on that. No. I I think\",\n",

      "Sentences for James Harden:\n",
      "  -  I just saw a tweet, Brandon, indicating that James Harden is a no show at Sixers practice today\n",
      "  -  Like, I I I don't really know what levers he's exactly trying to pull here\n",
      "  -  You know, there there was some reporting, you know, unsourced or at least anonymously sourced yesterday, you know, that the the sixers are starting to canvas a little bit more aggressively as far as, you know, what a James Harden trade might look like, getting some other teams beyond the clippers involved\n",
      "  -  I I I still think the most likely scenario given that we're 6 days away from opening night is that harden opens the season with the team, but I I I don't know if he's gonna be out there at opening night\n",
      "  -  Like, I still think he'll be a member of the sixers, but do you do you expect him to play in their 1st game of the season? I don't so I've actually changed my tune on this the last couple of days\n",
      "  -  I don't think he's gonna be on the team by the time this the the season starts\n",
      "  -  The sixers have high expectations this year\n",
      "  -  They know that, and it seems like he's willing to play hardball in terms of not suiting up\n",
      "  -  He it said that he just wants to play basketball, but I think it was with a implied not for you\n",
      "  -  He'll probably be may he might be traded by the time we drop this episode\n",
      "  -  But, you know, it it's it's gotten to the point now where I I think both sides would like this to be resolved before opening night, and that pressure is only gonna turn up before we get to the middle of next week and the sixers play their first game\n",
      "  -  I I think there are some teams that are probably monitoring this and saying, okay\n",
      "  -  You know, if if we could see him play for a couple months and and see that he's engaged and see that he still has it, you know, maybe later on, depending on how our season's going, we would consider bringing a player like that in\n",
      "  -  You know, you think of a team like the heat or, I don't know, the lakers who are always open to bringing in any big name player\n",
      "  -  I I think if you're the sixers and you say, you know, let's just, you know, for for the sake of conversation, do you wanna trade him by opening night? I I think my goal would be getting a 3rd team involved because I'm not I'm just not thrilled with what LA could offer here\n",
      "  -  I know they're calling him like borderline untouchable\n",
      "  -  He's looked okay\n",
      "  -  You know, when he's been given the opportunity, but if that's the headliner that I'm getting back for James Harden, I'm not psyched about it\n",
      "  -  You know, it could be someone like Norman Powell who's, you know, a good 15 to 18 point per game guy off the bench\n",
      "  -  I think the most likely scenarios he gets dealt for, especially if it's the Clippers, an unprotected first round pick\n",
      "  -  There's just there's not a big market for him\n",
      "  -  All these rosters are locked in, and the sixers wanna get rid of him a whole lot more than these other teams seem to wanna bring him in\n",
      "  -  I do think the Clippers make the most sense\n",
      "  -  I've thought that all along, far and away at the top of the list\n",
      "  -  Jimmy Butler has had a hard time getting along with teammates over the years because because other players he's played with aren't completely locked in and committed to basketball\n",
      "  -  So there there's no question about that\n",
      "  -  I also like, part of me just as a a basketball, fan, just out of pure curiosity, I I kinda wanna see him in Miami to see if that's the one organization that could get the most out of him\n",
      "  -  Right? Like, for the most part, they've they've avoided, you know, these these I wouldn't say troubled players\n",
      "  -  But I I think, you know, some of these same criticisms that we we have about James Harden right now, well, we we could have said the same thing about Jimmy Butler when he was, you know, forcing his way out of Minnesota on national television\n",
      "  -  And, you know, you go to Miami and and you you kinda get with that organization, you get with that coaching staff, and they have a way about, you know, maximizing players, especially players like Harden who we've kinda questioned, you know, what what kind of shape they're in to begin seasons\n",
      "  -  But I I I think Miami is content to to kinda sit back, play this out at least until, you know, midseason trade deadline, and that's, you know, when they would hopefully you know, another superstar shakes free and and potentially make their move after striking out on Damian Lillard\n",
      "  -  I I do wanna ask you, you know, if if you think James Harden is being dealt in the next week or so, what does the speed for Tyrese Maxey? You know, his his composite ADP right now we have a great page on rotorwire\n",
      "  -  If you think Harden's out the door and they're not bringing back another high usage star in that deal, which seems unlikely, Does that mean that you're willing, you know, to to push Tyrese Maxey up, you know, a half round or maybe even a full round? Absolutely\n"

       "\"yeah Shannon we saw like I mentioned Trey Murphy was a team's highest score for the Pelicans he still coming off the bench though  any concerns about that or do you think like either still a good chance he ends up playing 30 minutes a game off the bench maybe the Pokemon starting lineup at some point you know her Jones is still in there right now  yeah I mean that that 43 to 17 third quarter by the Lakers basically makes last night's game you know absolutely and there's no reason to really there's no big takeaways from last night's game is Susan turned into a blowout you know nothing really matters what happened with the Pelicans from there so the 22 minutes that Murphy saw last night I'm not worried about like you said you still the leading scorer for 14 points in those 22 minutesand anytime you was on the floor he was very aggressive on the offensive end you know he's played 2230 and 22 minutes in the three games he's returned from injury having some rest kind of being East back into the rotation champ be a big surprise but the fact that he already hit 30 minutes basically alleviates any concerns I would have will he be in the starting lineup I think that's a bigger question mark I don't Herbert Herbert Jones been playing so well for the Pelicans that I think they're gonna stick with them for at least a little while I mean they're 12 and 11 they had some assess the in-season tournament\""
